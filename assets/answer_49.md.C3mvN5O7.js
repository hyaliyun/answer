The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances .

RNAP has intrinsic helicase activity , therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind the DNA ( in contrast to DNA polymerase ) .

The translation was made by Robert Young , compiler of Young 's Analytical Concordance to the Bible and Concise Critical Comments on the New Testament . Young used the Textus Receptus ( TR ) and the Majority Text ( MT ) as the basis for his translation . He wrote in the preface to the first edition , \`\` It has been no part of the Translator 's plan to attempt to form a New Hebrew or Greek Text -- he has therefore somewhat rigidly adhered to the received ones . '' Young produced a \`\` Revised Version '' of his translation in 1887 , but he stuck with the Received Text . He wrote in the preface to the Revised Edition , \`\` The Greek Text followed is that generally recognized as the ' Received Text , ' not because it is thought perfect , but because the department of Translation is quite distinct from that of Textual Criticism , and few are qualified for both . If the original text be altered by a translator , ( except he give his reasons for and against each emendation , ) the reader is left in uncertainty whether the translation given is to be considered as that of the old or of the new reading . '' After Robert Young died on October 14 , 1888 , the publisher released a new Revised Edition in 1898 . The 1898 version though was based on the TR , easily confirmed by the word \`\` bathe '' in Rev. 1 : 5 and the word \`\` again '' in Rev 20 : 5 . The \`\` Publishers ' Note to the Third Edition '' explains , \`\` The work has been subjected to a fresh revision , making no alteration on the principles on which the Translation proceeds , but endeavouring to make it as nearly perfect in point of accuracy on its present lines as possible .

Motivation is a person 's internal disposition to be concerned with and approach positive incentives and avoid negative incentives . To further this , an incentive is the anticipated reward or aversive event available in the environment . While motivation can often be used as a tool to help predict behavior , it varies greatly among individuals and must often be combined with ability and environmental factors to actually influence behavior and performance . Results from a recent 2012 study , which examined age - related differences in work motivation , suggest a \`\` shift in people 's motives '' rather than a general decline in motivation with age . That is , it seemed that older employees were less motivated by extrinsically related features of a job , but more by intrinsically rewarding job features . Work motivation is strongly influenced by certain cultural characteristics . Between countries with comparable levels of economic development , collectivist countries tend to have higher levels of work motivation than do countries that tend toward individualism . Similarly measured , higher levels of work motivation can be found in countries that exhibit a long versus a short - term orientation .

Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin -- a scratch -- to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin . The referred sensation itself should not be painful ; it is more of an irritating prickle leading to the compulsion to scratch the area . The stimulus and referred itch are ipsilateral ( the stimulus and the referred itch occur on the same side of the body ) . Also , because scratching or putting pressure on the referred itch does not cause the stimulus area to itch , the relationship between the stimulus and the referred itch is unidirectional . The itching sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation ."},{"query":"blue mountain state where do we come from","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"first nfl playoff game to go into sudden death","short_answer":"1958 National Football League Championship Game","abstract":"The 1958 National Football League Championship Game was the 26th NFL championship game , played on December 28 at Yankee Stadium in New York City .

For instance , chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes . If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion , such as the kinetic energy of the pieces , as well as heat and sound , one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite . Classically , conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass ; however , special relativity showed that mass could be converted to energy and vice versa by E = mc , and science now takes the view that mass -- energy is conserved ."},{"query":"after flash thompson finished bullying peter parker he became","short_answer":"","abstract":"Eugene \`\` Flash '' Thompson is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics .

In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes , and in which each individual produces only one type , a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete -- called an ovum ( or egg ) -- and a male produces the smaller tadpole - like type -- called a sperm . In short a gamete is an egg ( female gamete ) or a sperm ( male gamete ) . This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy , the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes ( this is the case in humans ; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell ) . In contrast , isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape , and given arbitrary designators for mating type .

Great Britain followed the German model .

It replaced the Employers ' Liability Act 1880 , which gave the injured worker the right to sue the employer but put the burden of proof on the employee . After 1897 , injured employees had only to show that they had been injured on the job . These are roughly the same rights German workers were awarded in their 1884 law .

Federal charges are governed by US federal law and most states , with the exceptions of South Carolina and Missouri , have adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act .

A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase , reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms ( V × I ) . Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time . Apparent power is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit . Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source , or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source , the apparent power will be greater than the real power . A negative power factor occurs when the device ( which is normally the load ) generates power , which then flows back towards the source , which is normally considered the generator ."},{"query":"is the president of the senate the vice president","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"how to change group of file in unix","short_answer":"chgrp","abstract":"The chgrp ( from change group ) command may be used by unprivileged users on Unix - like systems to change the group associated with a file system object ( such as a file , directory , or link ) to one of which they are a member .

South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union .
