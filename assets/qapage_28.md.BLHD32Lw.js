Instead of relying on a single industry or sector for its economic future, the region has taken a diversified approach that have the potential to create opportunities for growth and expansion in the 21st century.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo and the surrounding area were long involved in railroad commerce, steel manufacture, automobile production, aircraft/aerospace design and production, Great Lakes shipping, and grain storage. Most of these industries have left the city through the years. Major steel production no longer exists in the area, although several smaller steel mills remain in operation. For example, Gibraltar Industries, a leading manufacturer, processor, and distributor of steel products for the building, industrial, and vehicular markets is headquartered in Buffalo. As of the 1950 United States Census, Buffalo was the 15th largest city in the country, the nation's largest inland port (twelfth overall), second biggest rail center, sixth largest steel producer, and eighth largest manufacturer.[2]\\r\\nOverall, employment in Buffalo has shifted as its population has declined and manufacturing has diminished. Buffalo's 2005 unemployment rate was 6.6%, contrasted with New York State's 5.0% rate.[3] And from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006, Erie County had no net job growth, ranking it 271st among the 326 largest counties in the country.[4] Yet the area has recently seen an upswing in job growth as unemployment has dropped to only 4.9% in July 2007 from 5.2% in 2006 and 6.6% in 2005.[5] The area's manufacturing jobs have continued to show the largest losses in jobs with over 17,000 fewer than at the start of 2006. Yet other sectors of the economy have outdistanced manufacturing and are seeing large increases. Educational and health services added over 30,400 jobs in 2006 and over 20,500 jobs have been added in the professional and business (mostly finance) arena.[6]\\r\\nBuffalo has increasingly become a center for bioinformatics and human genome research, including work by researchers at the University at Buffalo and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. This consortium is known as the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. It also includes: Buffalo Hearing & Speech Center, Buffalo Medical Group Foundation, Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Kaleida Health, Olmsted Center for the Visually Impaired, Cleveland BioLabs and Upstate New York Transplant Services.

For example, Buffalo BioSciences is a technology commercialization partner to the New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Life Sciences and contributed to the launch and early success of Empire Genomics?ÿ- a firm based on research conducted at Roswell Park Cancer Institute by Dr. Norma Nowak[7] enabling the delivery of personalized medicine.\\r\\nBuffalo is the headquarters of M&T Bank, a large regional bank with assets over $79B (as of June 2011).[8] HSBC Bank USA has reduced its local operations in Buffalo, and Upstate NY as a whole, as it closed its retail banking centers. Many of the shuttered HSBC retail banking centers in upstate were acquired by First Niagara Bank (see below). Other banks, such as Bank of America and KeyBank have corporate operations in Buffalo. Citigroup also has regional offices in Amherst, Buffalo's largest suburb. Buffalo has also become a hub of the debt collection industry.[9]\\r\\nFirst Niagara Bank recently moved its headquarters to downtown Buffalo from nearby Lockport. First Niagara has branches from Buffalo to Albany, New York, and since September 2009 has had branches as far south as Pittsburgh. On September 10, 2009, First Niagara announced the relocation of its corporate headquarters from Lockport to downtown Buffalo. The company says facilities in Lockport will remain open and fully staffed.[10] First Niagara, which had been considering expanding into Western Pennsylvania for some time,[11] benefited from PNC Financial Services being required by the United States Department of Justice to sell off 50 National City branches in the Pittsburgh area and 11 more branches in and around Erie to competitors,[12] since the two banks had significant overlap in Western Pennsylvania and had potential antitrust issues in that area. First Niagara took advantage by buying 57 of the 61 National City branches from PNC that had to be divested after PNC acquired National City with funds from the $700 billion bailout plan after National City became a victim of the subprime mortgage crisis. The move affected the area by creating 200 more jobs, some in the Buffalo area.[13] On July 31, 2011, it was announced First Niagara had acquired all of HSBC Banks Western New York branches; after closing and selling some branches to its competitors its total number in Upstate New York had almost doubled.[14]\\r\\nBuffalo is home to Rich Products, one of the world's largest family-owned food manufacturers.[15] Canadian brewer Labatt moved its US headquarters to Buffalo in May 2007.[16] This is in large part due to Buffalo's location directly in the middle of the Northeastern Trade Corridor. The city is the heart of the Canadian-American corridor. Over 80% of all U.S.-Canada trade occurs via border crossings in the eastern United States and with five bridges to Canada, the Buffalo area is one of the key eastern border crossing locations. Cheese company Sorrento Lactalis is also based in Buffalo.\\r\\nNew Era Cap Company, the largest sports-licensed headwear company in the United States, is based in Buffalo. It opened new headquarters in 2007 in the former Federal Reserve Building in downtown Buffalo.[17]\\r\\nThe windshield wiper maker Trico, founded in Buffalo by John R. Oishei, operated three major manufacturing facilities but has since closed all of them and moved operations to Mexico. In 1998, the company head office moved to Rochester Hills, Michigan.[18] Trico's Plant No. 1 was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 and in 2014 was being re-developed by the State University of New York at Buffalo. The John R. Oishei Foundation is western New York's largest and the new Women's & Children's Hospital, scheduled to open in 2015, will be named the John R.

Peaked traffic reached during World War II, but declined soon after the war.[19] Through the 1960s and 1970s freight traffic via Buffalo declined, air travel and the New York State Thruway took railway passengers away as well.[19] By 1980, the rail hub in the city was gone.[19]\\r\\nDel Monte Foods' Milk Bone dog biscuits are still manufactured in a small factory on the city's East Side.\\r\\nRegionally based insurance companies also have maintained their headquarters in Buffalo, New York.

Lawley Insurance provides commercial insurance, employee benefits, risk management and personal insurance.\\r\\nDelaware North Companies are headquartered in Buffalo.[20]\\r\\nThe loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization and high costs of labor have led to economic decline, making Buffalo one of the poorest among U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. An estimated 28.7ÿ29.9% of Buffalo residents live below the poverty line, behind either only Detroit,[21] or only Detroit and Cleveland.[22] Buffalo's median household income of $27,850 is third-lowest among large cities, behind only Miami and Cleveland; however the median household income for the metropolitan area is $57,000.[23]\\r\\nThis, in part, has led to the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area having the most affordable housing market in the U.S. today. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted that nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's median income of $57,000. The area median price of homes was $75,000.[citation needed]\\r\\nBuffalo faces issues with vacant and abandoned houses, as the city ranks second to St. Louis on the list of American cities with the most vacant properties per capita. Since 2000, the city has torn down 2,000 vacant homes but as many as 10,000 still remain. Mayor Byron W. Brown recently unveiled a $100 million, five-year plan to demolish 5,000 more houses.[24] The city's move away from heavy industry and toward a service and bioinformatics economy[citation needed] has brought improved air and water quality, which benefit not only residents and tourists but the bioregion as a whole. In July 2005, Reader's Digest ranked Buffalo as the third cleanest large city in the nation.[25]\\r\\nBuffalo's economy has begun to see significant improvements since the early 2010s.[26] Money from state governor Andrew Cuomo, plans for different construction programs, and hundreds of new jobs have brought strong economic change to the area.[27]\\r\\nAccording to the City's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[28] the principal employers in the Buffalo Metropolitan Area are:","input":"What is the main industry in buffalo ny?"},{"output":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","context":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and J.?K. Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998. The plot follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\\r\\nThe novel won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least seventy three other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels.\\r\\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, along with the rest of the Harry Potter series, has been attacked by several religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote witchcraft, but other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most evil and powerful dark wizard in history, Lord Voldemort, murders James and Lily Potter but mysteriously disappears after failing to kill their infant son, Harry. While the wizarding world celebrates Voldemort's apparent downfall, Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and half-giant Rubeus Hagrid place the one-year-old orphan in the care of his surly and cold Muggle uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their spoilt and bullying son, Dudley.\\r\\nFor ten years, living at number Four Privet Drive, Harry is treated by the Dursleys more like a servant than a member of the family and is forced to live in a cupboard under the stairs. Shortly before his eleventh birthday, a series of letters addressed to Harry arrive, but Uncle Vernon destroys them before Harry can read them, leading to an influx of more and more letters. To evade the pursuit of these letters, Vernon first takes the family to a hotel, but when the letters arrive there too, he hires a boat out to a hut on a small island.\\r\\nIt is Harry's eleventh birthday and at midnight, Hagrid bursts through the door to deliver the letter and to tell Harry what the Dursleys have kept from him: Harry is a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid is groundskeeper and Dumbledore is Headmaster. Hagrid takes Harry to a hidden London street called Diagon Alley, where he is surprised to discover how famous he is among the witches and wizards, who refer to him as \\"the boy who lived.\\" He also finds that his parents' inheritance is waiting for him at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Guided by Hagrid, he buys the equipment he will need for his first year at Hogwarts and as a birthday gift Harry receives a pet owl from Hagrid (which he names \\"Hedwig\\").\\r\\nA month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the Hogwarts Express from King's Cross railway station. There he meets the Weasley family, who show him how to pass through the magic wall to Platform 9?, where the train that will take them to Hogwarts is waiting. While on the train, Harry meets two fellow first years, Ron Weasley, who immediately becomes his friend, and Hermione Granger, with whom the ice is a bit slower to break. Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to advise Harry, but Harry dislikes Draco for his arrogance and prejudice and rejects his offer of \\"friendship\\".\\r\\nAt Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical Sorting Hat to houses that best suit their personalities. While Harry is being sorted, the Hat suggests that he be placed into Slytherin which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, but when Harry objects, the Hat sends him to Gryffindor. Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family before him.\\r\\nHarry starts classes at Hogwarts School, with lessons including Transfiguration with head of Gryffindor, Minerva McGonagall, Herbology with Head of Hufflepuff, Pomona Sprout, Charms with Head of Ravenclaw Filius Flitwick, and Defence Against the Dark Arts with Quirinus Quirrell. Harry's least favourite class is Potions, taught by Severus Snape, the vindictive Head of Slytherin who seems to loathe Harry. Harry, Ron, and Hermione become far more interested by extracurricular matters within and outside the school, particularly after they discover that a huge three-headed dog is standing guard over a trap door in a forbidden corridor. They also become suspicious of Snape's behaviour and become convinced that he is looking for ways to get past the trapdoor to whatever it's hiding.\\r\\nHarry discovers an innate talent for flying on broomsticks and is appointed as Seeker on his Houses Quidditch team, a wizards' sport played in the air. His first game goes well until his broomstick wobbles in mid-air and almost throws him off. Ron and Hermione suspect foul play from Snape, whom they saw behaving oddly. For Christmas, Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source and begins exploring the school at night and investigating the hidden object further. He discovers the Mirror of Erised (backwards for \\"desire\\"), in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires becoming true.\\r\\nThanks to an indiscretion from Hagrid, Harry and his friends work out that the object kept at the school is a Philosopher's Stone, made by an old friend of Dumbledore named Nicolas Flamel, which grants its user immortality, as long as it's constantly used. Harry is also informed by a centaur he meets in the forest that a plot to steal the Philosophers Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who would use it to be restored to his body and come back to power. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry and his friends fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.\\r\\nThey encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, and one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's chess. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirrell, who admits that he had tried to kill Harry at his Quidditch match against Slytherin. He also admits that he let a troll into Hogwarts. Snape had been trying to protect Harry all along rather than to kill him, and his suspicious behaviour came from his own suspicions about Quirrell.\\r\\nQuirrell is one of Voldemort's followers, and is now partly possessed by him: Voldemort's face has sprouted on the back of his own head, hidden by his turban. Voldemort needs Harry's help to get past the final obstacle: the Mirror of Erised. When stood in front of it, the Mirror recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it in his pocket. Quirrell promptly tries to seize the Stone, but his flesh burns on contact with Harry, proving lethal for Quirrell. Harry passes out and awakens in the school hospital, where Dumbledore explains to him that he survived because his mother sacrificed her life to protect him, and this left a powerful protective charm on him. It is also revealed that the invisibility cloak was left by his father for Dumbledore to keep and give to Harry. Voldemort left Quirrell to die and is likely to return by some other means. The Stone has now been destroyed. The school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys' for the summer holiday but does not tell them that under-age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts.\\r\\nOther members of staff include the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher, and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death; and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.\\r\\nIn the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a \\"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard\\",[2] and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.[8] During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, \\"always there when you need him\\".[4] Rowling has described Hermione as a \\"very logical, upright and good\\" character[5] with \\"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\\".[5]\\r\\nRowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant; Rowling described him as \\"epitome of goodness\\".[6] His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, who according to the author \\"under that gruff exterior\\" is \\"a bit of an old softy\\",[7] the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family, and the sinister Severus Snape.[9] Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.\\r\\nThe main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate[10] and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry, and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\\r\\nThe basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. [...] And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. [...] When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harryhe tried to curse him. [...] Andsobut for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.[3]\\r\\nThe book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known,[a] wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, \\"One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product.\\"[8] Then Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry.[8] Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of S8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels.[14] She sent the book to an agent and a publisher, and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000?words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book,[15] and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was \\"so much better than anything else\\".[16]\\r\\nBloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a S2,500 advance,[17] and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched.[15] He was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him, and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the nom de plume J.K. Rowling just before publication.[15] In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries.[18] Her original name, \\"Joanne Rowling\\", can be found in small print on the copyright page of this first British edition. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \\"Joanne\\" completely.)[19] The short initial print run was standard for first novels, and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[15] Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$33,460 in a 2007 Heritage Auction.[20]\\r\\nLindsey Fraser, who had supplied one of the blurb comments,[15] wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997. She described Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as \\"a hugely entertaining thriller\\" and Rowling as \\"a first-rate writer for children\\".[15][21] Another early review, in The Herald, said, \\"I have yet to find a child who can put it down.\\" Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian, The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday, and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five.[15] The Mail on Sunday rated it as \\"the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl\\"; a view echoed by the Sunday Times (\\"comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified\\"), while The Guardian called it \\"a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\\" and The Scotsman said it had \\"all the makings of a classic\\".[15]\\r\\nIn 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9?to?11?year-olds category of the Nestl Smarties Book Prize.[22] The Smarties award, which is voted for by children, made the book well-known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years.[15] The following year, Philosopher's Stone won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children.[15][b] It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults,[23] but did not win. Sandra Beckett comments that books which were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards?ÿ for example the literary establishment disdained the works of Roald Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books.[24] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[25]\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year.[15] By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies,[26] and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.[27] A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.[28]\\r\\nPlatform 9?, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.[29]\\r\\nScholastic Corporation bought the U.S. rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.[15] They thought that a child would not want to read a book with the word \\"philosopher\\" in the title and,[32][not in citation given] after some discussion, the American edition was published in September 1998[33] under the title Rowling suggested, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.[15] Rowling claimed that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time.[11] Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy, and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from \\"crumpet\\" to \\"muffin\\". While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English \\"mum\\" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant \\"mam\\" to \\"mom\\" in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of Philosopher's Stone. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time, and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits.[30] Since the British editions of early titles in the series were published a few months earlier than the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions after buying them via the Internet.[34]\\r\\nAt first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices, which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.[35] Although The Boston Globe and Michael Winerip in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book,[21][36] they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.[15][21] A year later the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1998, and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year, and won Parenting Magazine's Book of the Year Award for 1998,[22] the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.[15]\\r\\nIn August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone topped the New York Times list of best-selling fiction,[37] and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings.[24][35] Publishers Weekly's report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6?million copies).[38]\\r\\nIn May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book[39] that was released on 1 October 2008[40] to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release.[39] For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released Sorcerer's Stone, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.[41][42][43]\\r\\nBy mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67 languages.[44]By September 11, 2017, official translations of the book had been published in 74 languages.[45] Bloomsbury have published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek,[46][47] and the latter was described as \\"one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries\\".[48]\\r\\nPhilip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line?ÿ for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the Harry Potter books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories,[21]:13ÿ15 and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.[49] Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genres??fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman and many others.[21]:51ÿ52\\r\\nSome reviewers compared Philosopher's Stone to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Philosopher's Stone, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in Philosopher's Stone resembled parts of Dahl's stories; for example, the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts??one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.[15]\\r\\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley.[22][50] Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: \\"rapid, plain, and direct in expression.\\"[48] Stephen King admired \\"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.[51]\\r\\nNicholas Tucker described the early Harry Potter books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.[52] Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes.[53] However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.[54]\\r\\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards.

A standard drink varies in volume depending on the alcohol concentration of the beverage (for example, a standard drink of spirits takes up much less space than a standard drink of beer), but it always contains the same amount of alcohol and therefore produces the same amount of drunkenness.\\r\\nThe standard drink is used in relation to recommendations about alcohol consumption and its relative risks to health. Many government health guidelines specify low to high risk amounts in units of grams of pure alcohol per day, week, or single occasion. The concept of the standard drink is meant to help visualize and estimate the absolute alcohol content of various drink concentrations and serving sizes.\\r\\nFor example, in the United States, a standard drink contains about 14 grams of alcohol.[1] This corresponds to a 12-US-fluid-ounce (350?ml) glass of beer, a 5-US-fluid-ounce (150?ml) glass of 12% wine, or a 1.5-US-fluid-ounce (44?ml) glass of spirit.[2][n 1]\\r\\nDifferent countries define standard drinks differently. For example, in Australia, a standard drink contains 10 grams of alcohol,[3] but in Japan, it contains nearly 20 grams. In addition, a standard drink is often different from normal serving size in the country in which it is served.[4]\\r\\nLabeling is usually required to give an indication of alcoholic content of a serving. Australia requires that \\"the label on a package of an alcoholic beverage must include a statement of the number of standard drinks in the package\\".[3]\\r\\nThe term \\"standard drink\\" was used in the United Kingdom in the first guidelines (1984) that published \\"safe limits\\" for drinking, but this was replaced by reference to \\"alcohol units\\" in the 1987 guidelines and that term has been used in all subsequent UK guidance.[5] A unit of alcohol is defined there as 10 millilitres (8 grams) of pure alcohol.[6][7] This definition is independent of the strength (% ABV) and amount (volume) of any individual alcoholic beverage. The number of units of alcohol in a bottle or can (and, optionally, the number of units in a typical serving) are indicated on the drink container. Typical servings deliver 1ÿ3 units of alcohol.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of alcohol is stated in the table in both grams and millilitres. The number of standard drinks contained in 500ml of beer of 5% ABV (a typical large drink of beer) is stated for comparison.[9]\\r\\nPure alcohol mass in a serving can be calculated if concentration, density and volume are known.\\r\\nFor example, 0.35 litre glass of beer with ABV of 5.5% has 15.2 grams of pure alcohol. Pure alcohol has density of 789.24 g/l (at 20?C).\\r\\nWhen drink size is in fluid ounces (which differ between the UK and the US), the following conversions can be used:\\r\\nOne should bear in mind that a pint in the UK is 20 UK fluid ounces, whereas a pint in the US is only 16 US fluid ounces.\\r\\nOn average, it takes about one hour for the body to metabolise (break down) one standard drink as defined by U.S. guidelines (i.e. 12 ounces of 5% beer, 5 ounces of 12% wine, or 1.5 ounces of 40% liquor). However, this can vary with body weight, sex, age, personal metabolic rate, recent food intake, the type and strength of the alcohol, and medications taken.

The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.\\r\\nTraditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea to the Armenian Highlands (Armenia Major). This region is now named and largely situated in the Eastern Anatolia Region of the far north east of Turkey and converges with the Lesser Caucasus ÿ an area that was incorporated in the Russian Empire region of Transcaucasia in the 19th century.[5][6] Thus, traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey.\\r\\nAnatolia is often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, which comprises almost the entire country;[7] its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the Turkish borders with neighboring Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, in clockwise direction.\\r\\nThe ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages, which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods. The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the early 14th and early 20th centuries. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including Kurdish, Assyrian, Armenian, Arabic, Laz, Georgian, and Greek. Ancient peoples in the region included Galatians, Hurrians, Scythians, Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Hattians, Cimmerians, Ionian Greeks, the Mongols and Arabs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anatolian peninsula, also called Asia Minor, is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, the Aegean Sea to the west, and the Sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from Thrace in Europe.\\r\\nTraditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the Gulf of Alexandretta to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. This traditional geographical definition is used, for example, in the latest edition of Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary,[1] as well as the archeological community.[2] Under this definition, Anatolia is bounded to the east by the Armenian Highlands, and the Euphrates before that river bends to the southeast to enter Mesopotamia.[2] To the southeast, it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in Syria (region) and the Mesopotamian plain.[2]\\r\\nFollowing the Armenian Genocide and establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the Armenian Highlands (or Western Armenia) were renamed \\"Eastern Anatolia\\" (literally The Eastern East) by the Turkish government,[8][9] being effectively co-terminous with Asian Turkey. Turkey's First Geography Congress in 1941 created two regions to the east of the Gulf of Iskenderun-Black Sea line named the Eastern Anatolia Region and the Southeastern Anatolia Region,[10] the former largely corresponding to the western part of the Armenian Highland, the latter to the northern part of the Mesopotamian plain. This wider definition of Anatolia has gained widespread currency outside of Turkey and has, for instance, been adopted by Encyclop?dia Britannica[11] and other encyclopedic and general reference publications.[12] Vazken Davidian terms the expanded use of \\"Anatolia\\" to apply to territory formerly referred to as Armenia as \\"an historical imposition\\", and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with referring to the Ottoman East as \\"Eastern Anatolia\\".[13]\\r\\nThe oldest known reference to Anatolia ÿ as Land of the Hatti ÿ appears on Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets from the period of the Akkadian Empire (2350ÿ2150 BC).[citation needed] The first recorded name the Greeks used for the Anatolian peninsula, ??ϫ (Asa),[14] presumably echoed the name of the Assuwa league in western Anatolia.[citation needed] As the name \\"Asia\\" broadened its scope to apply to other areas east of the Mediterranean, Greeks in Late Antiquity came to use the name ? ??ϫ (Mikr Asa) or Asia Minor, meaning \\"Lesser Asia\\" to refer to present-day Anatolia.\\r\\nThe English-language name Anatolia itself derives from the Greek ?ϫ? (anatol?) meaning the East or more literally sunrise (comparable to the Latin-derived terms levant and orient).[15][16] The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring to the Aeolian, Ionian and Dorian colonies on the west coast of Asia Minor. In the Byzantine Empire, the Anatolic Theme (Aϫ? Ĳ?ϫ) was a theme covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day Central Anatolia Region.[17][18] The modern Turkish form of Anatolia, Anadolu, derives from the Greek name Aϫ? (Anatol?). The Russian male name Anatoly and the French Anatole share the same linguistic origin.\\r\\nIn English the name of Turkey for ancient Anatolia first appeared c. 1369. It derives from the Medieval Latin Turchia (meaning Land of the Turks, Turkish Trkiye), a name originally used by Europeans to designate those parts of Anatolia controlled by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum after the Battle of Manzikert (1071).[citation needed]\\r\\nHuman habitation in Anatolia dates back to the Paleolithic.[20] Neolithic Anatolia has been proposed as the homeland of the Indo-European language family, although linguists tend to favour a later origin in the steppes north of the Black Sea. However, it is clear that the Anatolian languages, the oldest attested branch of Indo-European, have been spoken in Anatolia since at least the 19th century BC.\\r\\nThe earliest historical records of Anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the Mesopotamian-based Akkadian Empire during the reign of Sargon of Akkad in the 24th century BC. Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the Hattians and Hurrians. The Hattians spoke a language of unclear affiliation, and the Hurrian language belongs to a small family called Hurro-Urartian, all these languages now being extinct; relationships with indigenous languages of the Caucasus have been proposed[21] but are not generally accepted. The region was famous for exporting raw materials, and areas of Hattian- and Hurrian-populated southeast Anatolia were colonised by the Akkadians.[22]\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Akkadian Empire in the mid-21st century BC, the Assyrians, who were the northern branch of the Akkadian people, colonised parts of the region between the 21st and mid-18th centuries BC and claimed its resources, notably silver. One of the numerous cuneiform records dated circa 20th century BC, found in Anatolia at the Assyrian colony of Kanesh, uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.[22]\\r\\nUnlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in Mesopotamia, the Hittites were centred at Hattusa (modern Bo?azkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the Hittite language, or nesili (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of Nesa around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted Kurgan theory on the Proto-Indo-European homeland, however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European ancient Anatolians) were themselves relatively recent immigrants to Anatolia from the north.\\r\\nThe Hittites adopted the cuneiform script, invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 1650 BC, they created a kingdom, the Hittite New Kingdom, which became an empire in the 14th century BC after the conquest of Kizzuwatna in the south-east and the defeat of the Assuwa league in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern Syria and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal Kaskians, had established themselves there, displacing earlier Palaic-speaking Indo-Europeans.[23] Much of the history of the Hittite Empire concerned war with the rival empires of Egypt, Assyria and the Mitanni.[24]\\r\\nThe Egyptians eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the Hittites and becoming wary of the power of Assyria, which had destroyed the Mitanni Empire.[24] The Assyrians and Hittites were then left to battle over control of eastern and southern Anatolia and colonial territories in Syria. The Assyrians had better success than the Egyptians, annexing much Hittite (and Hurrian) territory in these regions.[25]\\r\\nAfter 1180 BC, during the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Hittite empire disintegrated into several independent Syro-Hittite states, subsequent to losing much territory to the Middle Assyrian Empire and being finally overrun by the Phrygians, another Indo-European people who are believed to have migrated from the Balkans. The Phrygian expansion into southeast Anatolia was eventually halted by the Assyrians, who controlled that region.[25]\\r\\nArameans encroached over the borders of south central Anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the Hittite empire, and some of the Syro-Hittite states in this region became an amalgam of Hittites and Arameans. These became known as Syro-Hittite states.\\r\\nIn central and western Anatolia, another Indo-European people, the Luwians, came to the fore, circa 2000 BC. Their language was closely related to Hittite.[26] The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spokento a greater or lesser degreeacross a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) Wilusa (Troy), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the Hermos and/or Kaikos valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley.[27] From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as Lydia, Caria and Lycia, all of which had Hellenic influence.\\r\\nFrom the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the east, central, and southeastern regions) fell to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, including all of the Syro-Hittite states, Tabal, Kingdom of Commagene, the Cimmerians and Scythians and swathes of Cappadocia.\\r\\nThe Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by Medes, Persians, Scythians and their own Babylonian relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was Harran in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of Babylon, the Assyrian Nabonidus and his son and regent Belshazzar. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based Median Empire, with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.\\r\\nFrom the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the Cimmerians and Scythians. The Cimmerians overran Phrygia and the Scythians threatened to do the same to Urartu and Lydia, before both were finally checked by the Assyrians.\\r\\nThe north-western coast of Anatolia was inhabited by Greeks of the Achaean/Mycenaean culture from the 20th century BC, related to the Greeks of south eastern Europe and the Aegean.[28] Beginning with the Bronze Age collapse at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by Ionian Greeks, usurping the area of the related but earlier Mycenaean Greeks. Over several centuries, numerous Ancient Greek city-states were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia (Pre-Socratic philosophy).[28]\\r\\nIn classical antiquity, Anatolia was described by Herodotus and later historians as divided into regions named after tribes such as Lydia, Lycia, Caria, Mysia, Bithynia, Phrygia, Galatia, Lycaonia, Pisidia, Paphlagonia, Cilicia, and Cappadocia. By that time, the populations were a mixture of the ancient Anatolian or \\"Syro-Hittite\\" substrate and post-Bronze-Age-collapse \\"Thraco-Phrygian\\" and more recent Greco-Macedonian incursions.\\r\\nAnatolia is known as the birthplace of minted coinage (as opposed to unminted coinage, which first appears in Mesopotamia at a much earlier date) as a medium of exchange, some time in the 7th century BC in Lydia. The use of minted coins continued to flourish during the Greek and Roman eras.[29][30]\\r\\nDuring the 6th century BC, all of Anatolia was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, the Persians having usurped the Medes as the dominant dynasty in Iran. In 499 BC, the Ionian city-states on the west coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule. The Ionian Revolt, as it became known, though quelled, initiated the Greco-Persian Wars, which ended in a Greek victory in 449 BC, and the Ionian cities regained their independence, alongside the withdrawal of the Persian forces from their European territories.\\r\\nIn 334 BC, the Macedonian Greek king Alexander the Great conquered the peninsula from the Achaemenid Persian Empire.[31] Alexander's conquest opened up the interior of Asia Minor to Greek settlement and influence.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Alexander and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the Attalids of Pergamum and the Seleucids, the latter controlling most of Anatolia. A period of peaceful Hellenization followed, such that the local Anatolian languages had been supplanted by Greek by the 1st century BC. In 133 BC the last Attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman Republic, and western and central Anatolia came under Roman control, but Hellenistic culture remained predominant. Further annexations by Rome, in particular of the Kingdom of Pontus by Pompey, brought all of Anatolia under Roman control, except for the eastern frontier with the Parthian Empire, which remained unstable for centuries, causing a series of wars, culminating in the Roman-Parthian Wars.\\r\\nAfter the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or Byzantine Empire. Anatolia was one of the first places where Christianity spread, so that by the 4th century AD, western and central Anatolia were overwhelmingly Christian and Greek-speaking. For the next 600 years, while Imperial possessions in Europe were subjected to barbarian invasions, Anatolia would be the center of the Hellenic world. Byzantine control was challenged by Arab raids starting in the eighth century (see ArabÿByzantine wars), but in the ninth and tenth century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories, including even long lost territory such as Armenia and Syria (ancient Aram).\\r\\nIn the 10 years following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Seljuk Turks from Central Asia migrated over large areas of Anatolia, with particular concentrations around the northwestern rim.[32] The Turkish language and the Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking (although ethnic groups such as Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians remained numerous and retained Christianity and their native languages). In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk Sultanate of R?m, with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced.[33]\\r\\nIn 1255, the Mongols swept through eastern and central Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The Ilkhanate garrison was stationed near Ankara.[33][34] After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335ÿ1353, the Mongol Empire's legacy in the region was the Uyghur Eretna Dynasty that was overthrown by Kadi Burhan al-Din in 1381.[35]\\r\\nBy the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various Anatolian beyliks. Smyrna fell in 1330, and the last Byzantine stronghold in Anatolia, Philadelphia, fell in 1390. The Turkmen Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk sultans.[36][37] The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the Mongol Ilkhanids.[38] The Osmanli ruler Osman I was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s, for it bears the legend \\"Minted by Osman son of Ertugul\\".[39] Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to a sovereign, it can be considered that the Osmanli, or Ottoman Turks, became formally independent from the Mongol Khans.[40]\\r\\nAmong the Turkish leaders, the Ottomans emerged as great power under Osman I and his son Orhan I.[citation needed] The Anatolian beyliks were successively absorbed into the rising Ottoman Empire during the 15th century.[citation needed] It is not well understood how the Osmanl?, or Ottoman Turks, came to dominate their neighbours, as the history of medieval Anatolia is still little known.[41] The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum) from the Knights of Saint John.[citation needed]\\r\\nWith the acceleration of the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of Czarist Russia in the Caucasus, many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly Circassians, Tatars, Azeris, Lezgis, Chechens and several Turkic groups left their homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the Balkan regions and then fragmented during the Balkan Wars, much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, Albanians, Turks, Muslim Bulgarians and Greek Muslims such as the Vallahades from Greek Macedonia), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.\\r\\nA continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, Constantinople and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.\\r\\nFollowing the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.\\r\\nAnatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire). During World War I, the Armenian Genocide, the Greek genocide (especially in Pontus), and the Assyrian genocide almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the Greco-Turkish War of 1919ÿ1922, most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Many more have left Turkey since, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today. Since the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, Anatolia has been within Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see demographics of Turkey and history of Turkey).\\r\\nAnatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central massif composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded troughs, covered by recent deposits and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the K?z?l River, the coastal plains of ?ukurova and the valley floors of the Gediz River and the Byk Menderes River as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around Lake Tuz (Salt Lake) and the Konya Basin (Konya Ovasi).\\r\\nAnkara (central Anatolia)\\r\\nAntalya (southern Anatolia)\\r\\nVan (eastern Anatolia)\\r\\nAnatolia has a varied range of climates. The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters. The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers.[42] The Black Sea and Marmara coasts have a temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.\\r\\nThere is a diverse number of plant and animal communities.\\r\\nThe mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia experiences humid and mild climate. There are temperate broadleaf, mixed and coniferous forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier continental climate, has deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a Mediterranean climate, contain Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions.\\r\\nAlmost 80% of the people currently residing in Anatolia are Turks.

Published every year by the Roman Curia, the Annuario Pontificio attaches no consecutive numbers to the popes, stating that it is impossible to decide which side represented at various times the legitimate succession, in particular regarding Pope Leo VIII, Pope Benedict V and some mid-11th-century popes.[1] The 2001 edition of the Annuario Pontificio introduced \\"almost 200 corrections to its existing biographies of the popes, from St Peter to John Paul II\\". The corrections concerned dates, especially in the first two centuries, birthplaces and the family name of one pope.[2]\\r\\nThe term pope (Latin: papa \\"father\\") is used in several Churches to denote their high spiritual leaders (for example Coptic Pope). This title in English usage usually refers to the head of the Catholic Church. The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including Summus Pontifex, Pontifex Maximus, and Servus servorum Dei. Each title has been added by unique historical events and unlike other papal prerogatives, is not incapable of modification.[3]\\r\\nHermannus Contractus may have been the first historian to number the popes continuously. His list ends in 1049 with Pope Leo IX as number 154. Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century. Antipope Christopher was considered legitimate for a long time. Pope-elect Stephen was considered legitimate under the name Stephen II until the 1961 edition, when his name was erased. Although these changes are no longer controversial, a number of modern lists still include this \\"first Pope Stephen II\\". It is probable that this is because they are based on the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia, which is in the public domain.\\r\\nA significant number of these popes have been recognized as saints, including 48 out of the first 50 consecutive popes, and others are in the sainthood process.

In the context of the musical, \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" is sung by the character Effie White, a singer with the girl group The Dreams, to her manager, Curtis Taylor Jr., whose romantic and professional relationship with Effie is quickly ending. The lyrics to \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\", often considered the show's signature tune, describe Effie's love for Curtis, both strongly devoted and defiant. She refuses to let Curtis leave her behind, and boldly proclaims to him, \\"I'm staying and you ... you're gonna love me.\\"\\r\\nIn addition to its presence in the musical, \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" is also notable as the debut single of two women who portrayed Effie. Jennifer Holliday originated the role on Broadway in 1981 and won a Tony Award for her performance as well as the Grammy for Best R&B Performance, Female for its re-release in 1982 for which it became a number-one R&B hit for Holliday.

It encompasses two active volcanoes: Kؐlauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa, the world's most massive shield volcano. The park delivers scientists insight into the birth of the Hawaiian Islands and ongoing studies into the processes of volcanism. For visitors, the park offers dramatic volcanic landscapes as well as glimpses of rare flora and fauna.\\r\\nIn recognition of its outstanding natural values, Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park was designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987.[3] In 2012 the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park was honored on the 14th quarter of the America the Beautiful Quarters series.\\r\\nAs of May 10, 2018, the park is closed to the public in the Kؐlauea volcano summit area, including the visitor center and park headquarters, due to explosions and toxic ash clouds from Halema?uma?u crater, as well as earthquakes and road damage.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park includes 323,431 acres (505.36?sq?mi; 1,308.88?km2) of land.[5] Over half of the park is designated the Hawaii Volcanoes Wilderness area and provides unusual hiking and camping opportunities. The park encompasses diverse environments that range from sea level to the summit of the Earth's most massive active volcano, Mauna Loa at 13,677 feet (4,169?m). Climates range from lush tropical rain forests, to the arid and barren Ka? Desert.\\r\\nActive eruptive sites include the main caldera of Kؐlauea and a more active but remote vent called Pu?u ??.[6]\\r\\nThe main entrance to the park is from the Hawaii Belt Road. The Chain of Craters Road, as the name implies, leads past several craters from historic eruptions to the coast. It used to continue to another entrance to the park near the town of Kalapana, but that portion is now covered by a lava flow.\\r\\nKؐlauea and its Halema?uma?u caldera were traditionally considered the sacred home of the volcano goddess Pele, and Hawaiians visited the crater to offer gifts to the goddess.\\r\\nIn 1790, a party of warriors (along with women and children who were in the area) were caught in an unusually violent eruption. Many were killed and others left footprints in the lava that can still be seen today.[7]\\r\\nThe first western visitors to the site, English missionary William Ellis and American Asa Thurston, went to Kؐlauea in 1823. Ellis wrote of his reaction to the first sight of the erupting volcano:\\r\\nA spectacle, sublime and even appalling, presented itself before us. 'We stopped and trembled.' Astonishment and awe for some moments rendered us mute, and, like statues, we stood fixed to the spot, with our eyes riveted on the abyss below.[8]\\r\\nThe volcano became a tourist attraction in the 1840s, and local businessmen such as Benjamin Pitman and George Lycurgus ran a series of hotels at the rim.[9] Volcano House is the only hotel or restaurant located within the borders of the national park.\\r\\nLorrin A. Thurston, grandson of the American missionary Asa Thurston, was one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the park after investing in the hotel from 1891 to 1904. William R. Castle first proposed the idea in 1903. Thurston, who then owned the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper, printed editorials in favor of the park idea. In 1907, the territory of Hawaii paid for fifty members of Congress and their wives to visit Haleakala and Kؐlauea. It included a dinner cooked over lava steam vents. In 1908 Thurston entertained Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield, and in 1909 another congressional delegation. Governor Walter F. Frear proposed a draft bill in 1911 to create \\"Kilauea National Park\\" for $50,000. Thurston and local landowner William Herbert Shipman proposed boundaries, but ran into some opposition from ranchers. Thurston printed endorsements from John Muir, Henry Cabot Lodge, and former President Theodore Roosevelt.[10] After several attempts, the legislation introduced by delegate Jonah Khi Kalaniana'ole finally passed to create the park. House Resolution 9525 was signed by Woodrow Wilson on August 1, 1916. It was the 11th National Park in the United States, and the first in a Territory.[11]\\r\\nWithin a few weeks, the National Park Service Organic Act would create the National Park Service to run the system.[12] Originally called \\"Hawaii National Park\\", it was split from the Haleakal National Park on September 22, 1961 (75 Stat. 577) to be formally known as Hawai\`i Volcanoes National Park.\\r\\nAn easily accessible lava tube was named for the Thurston family. An undeveloped stretch of the Thurston Lava Tube extends an additional 1,100?ft (340?m) beyond the developed area and dead-ends into the hillside, but it is closed to the general public.\\r\\nIn 2004, an additional 115,788 acres (468.58?km2) of Kahuku Ranch were added to the park, making it 56% larger. This was an area west of the town of Wai?hinu and east of Ocean View, the largest land acquisition in Hawaii's history.

In 1966, the artist's son, Harvey, donated the painting to the Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park, where it was displayed in the visitors' center from 1966 to 2005.[18] The painting was criticized for portraying the Hawaiian goddess as a Caucasian.[18]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Volcano Art Center announced a competition for a \\"more modern and culturally authentic rendering\\" of the goddess.[19] An anonymous judging panel of Native Hawaiian elders selected a painting by Arthur Johnsen of Pahoa, Hawaii from 140 entries.

She is holding a digging stick (??) in her left hand and the egg that gave birth to her younger sister Hi?iaka in her right hand.[19] In 2005, the Hitchcock was replaced with Johnsen's painting.\\r\\nOn March 19, 2008, there was a small explosion in Halema?uma?u crater, the first explosive event since 1924 and the first eruption in the Kؐlauea caldera since September 1982. Debris from the explosion was scattered over an area of 74 acres (300,000?m2). A small amount of ash was also reported at a nearby community. The explosion covered part of Crater Rim Drive and damaged Halema?uma?u Overlook. The explosion did not release any lava, which suggests to scientists that it was driven by hydrothermal or gas sources.[20]\\r\\nThis explosion event followed the opening of a major sulfur dioxide gas vent, greatly increasing levels emitted from the Halema?uma?u crater. The dangerous increase of sulfur dioxide gas prompted closures of Crater Rim Drive between the Jaggar Museum south/southeast to Chain of Craters Road, Crater Rim Trail from Kؐlauea Military Camp south/southeast to Chain of Craters Road, and all trails leading to Halema?uma?u crater, including those from Byron Ledge, ?Iliahi (Sandalwood) Trail, and Ka? Desert Trail.[21]\\r\\nIn mid-May 2018, the park was closed due to explosive eruptions at Halema\`uma\`u crater. As of May 31, the Kؐlauea area of the park has remained closed, making the closure the longest in the parks history.[22]","input":"When was the hawaii volcanoes national park established?"},{"output":"city center or downtown","context":"","input":"What is the main part of a city?"},{"output":"Nipper","context":"Nipper (1884ÿ1895) was a dog from Bristol, England, who served as the model for a painting by Francis Barraud titled \\"His Master's Voice\\". This image was the basis for the dog-and-gramophone commercial logo, one of the world's most famous used by several audio recording and associated company brands, including Berliner Gramophone and its various successors, affiliates, and successors, including Berliner's German subsidiary Deutsche Grammophon; Berliner's American successor the Victor Talking Machine Co. (later known as RCA Victor and then RCA Records); Victor's Bluebird label; Zonophone; Berliner's (and later Victor's) British affiliate the Gramophone Co. Ltd. (informally known as His Master's Voice) and its successors EMI and HMV Retail Ltd.; the Gramophone Co.'s German subsidiary Electrola; Zonophone; and onetime Victor subsidiary the Japan Victor Company (JVC).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNipper was born in 1884 in Bristol, England, and died in September 1895.[1] He was a mixed-breed dog and probably part Jack Russell Terrier,[2] although some sources suggest that he was a Smooth Fox Terrier,[3] or \\"part Bull Terrier\\".[4] He was named Nipper because he would \\"nip\\" the backs of visitors' legs.[5]\\r\\nNipper originally lived with his owner, Mark Henry Barraud, in the Prince's Theatre where Barraud was a scenery designer.[6] When Barraud died in 1887, his brothers Philip and Francis took care of the dog. Nipper himself died of natural causes in 1895 and was buried in Kingston upon Thames in Clarence Street, in a small park surrounded by magnolia trees. As time progressed the area was built upon, and a branch of Lloyds Bank now occupies the site. On the wall of the bank, just inside the entrance, a brass plaque commemorates the terrier that lies beneath the building.[7]\\r\\nOn 10 March 2010, a small road near to the dog's resting place in Kingston upon Thames was named Nipper Alley in commemoration of this resident.[8]\\r\\nIn 1898, three years after Nipper's death, Francis Barraud, his last owner and brother of his first owner, painted a picture of Nipper listening intently to a wind-up Edison-Bell cylinder phonograph. Thinking the Edison-Bell Company located in New Jersey, USA,[5] might find it useful, he presented it to James E. Hough, who promptly said, \\"Dogs don't listen to phonographs\\". On May 31, 1899, Barraud went to the Maiden Lane offices of The Gramophone Company with the intention of borrowing a brass horn to replace the original black horn on the painting. Manager William Barry Owen suggested that if the artist replaced the machine with a Berliner disc gramophone, that he would buy the painting. The image became the successful trademark of the Victor and HMV record labels, HMV music stores, and the Radio Corporation of America, after the acquisition of the Victor company in 1929. The trademark was registered by Berliner for use in the United States on July 10, 1900.[9] (See His Master's Voice for a complete history of the brands based on Nipper.)\\r\\nThe slogan \\"His Master's Voice\\", along with the painting, was sold to The Gramophone Company for 100 pounds sterling - 50 pounds for the copyright and 50 pounds for the painting itself.[10] Francis Barraud said?: \\"It is difficult to say how the idea came to me beyond the fact that it suddenly occurred to me that to have my dog listening to the phonograph, with an intelligent and rather puzzled expression, and call it 'His Master's Voice' would make an excellent subject. We had a phonograph and I often noticed how puzzled he was to make out where the voice came from. It certainly was the happiest thought I ever had.\\"[11] The original oil painting hung in the EMI board room in Hayes, Middlesex, for many years.\\r\\nThe iconic image of a mixed fox/bull terrier, Nipper, looking into a phonograph became an international symbol of quality and excellence for the Victor Talking Machine Company.[12] Nipper lives on through the brand names; he even appeared in ads on television with his \\"son\\", a puppy named Chipper who was added to the RCA family in 1991.[13] Real dogs continue to play the roles of Nipper and Chipper, but Chipper has to be replaced much more frequently, since his character is a puppy.\\r\\nNipper continues to be the mascot of HMV stores in countries where the entertainment retailer has the rights to him. Both RCA Records and EMI have deemphasized Nipper in the global music market due to the fragmented ownership of the trademark.\\r\\nVictor Company of Japan (JVC) also uses the logo within Japan, which includes the \\"His Master's Voice\\" slogan.\\r\\nA huge, four-ton Nipper can be seen on the roof of the old RTA (former RCA distributor) building now owned by Arnoff Moving & Storage[14] and located at 991 Broadway in Albany, New York.[11] A second slightly smaller one was purchased by Jim Wells from RCA in Baltimore for $1. After spending many years on private property in Nipper Park in Merrifield, Virginia, perched over Lee Highway (U.S. Route 29), has now been returned to Baltimore, Maryland, where it originally graced the former RCA Building on Russell Street. Nipper now sits atop the Maryland Historical Society building at Park Avenue and West Centre Street in Baltimore. Though smaller than the Albany Nipper, Baltimore's is the only one of the two to include a gramophone for Nipper to listen to. The Baltimore Nipper was saved when the Virginia site where he briefly resided was sold to developers. It is currently the location of a group of townhomes. The street leading to the development is named Nipper Way.[15]\\r\\nA small statue of Nipper can be seen perched above a doorway in the Merchant Venturers Building on the corner of Park Row and Woodland Road in Bristol; this building, part of the University of Bristol, stands near the site of the old Prince's Theatre.\\r\\nA life-size ornament of Nipper appears in the music video to Cyndi Lauper's song \\"Time After Time.\\"\\r\\nNipper has also been the subject of parodies. One example can be found on the cover of the 1982 bootleg compilation album Elvis' Greatest Shit, a collection of recordings that, in the bootlegger's opinion, were among the worst that Elvis Presley made. The album's putative record company was \\"Dog Vomit\\" instead of RCA Victor, Presley's label during almost all of his career, and its logo featured a dog resembling Nipper vomiting into a gramophone.\\r\\nCurrently, as of May 2017, the City of Albany is holding a contest for various groups or artists to submit designs for creative, painted Nipper statues to be placed throughout the City. Ten of the contestants will be chosen to create ten Nipper statues - which will be displayed for one year and then auctioned off for charity.[16]","input":"What is the name of the rca victor dog?"},{"output":"glucose-fructose","context":"High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) (also called glucose-fructose, isoglucose and glucose-fructose syrup[1][2]) is a sweetener made from corn starch that has been processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. HFCS was first marketed in the early 1970s by the Clinton Corn Processing Company, together with the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and Technology where the enzyme was discovered in 1965.[3]:5\\r\\nAs a sweetener, HFCS is often compared to granulated sugar, but manufacturing advantages of HFCS over sugar include that it is easier to handle and more cost-effective.[4] The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing.[5] There is debate over whether HFCS presents greater health risks than other sweeteners.[6] Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have continued to grow over the early 21st Century.[7]\\r\\nApart from comparisons between HFCS and table sugar, there is some evidence that the overconsumption of added sugar in any form, including HFCS, is a major health problem, especially for onset of obesity.[4][8][9] Consuming added sugars, particularly as sweetened soft drinks, is strongly linked to weight gain.[4][10] The World Health Organization has recommended that people limit their consumption of added sugars to 10% of calories, but experts say that typical consumption of empty calories in the United States is nearly twice that level.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., HFCS is among the sweeteners that mostly replaced sucrose (table sugar) in the food industry.[11] Factors include production quotas of domestic sugar, import tariff on foreign sugar, and subsidies of U.S. corn, raising the price of sucrose and lowering that of HFCS, making it cheapest for many sweetener applications.[12][13] The relative sweetness of HFCS 55, used most commonly in soft drinks, is comparable to sucrose.[14] HFCS (and/or standard corn syrup) is the primary ingredient in most brands of commercial \\"pancake syrup\\", as a less expensive substitute for maple syrup.[15]\\r\\nBecause of its similar sugar profile and lower price, HFCS has been used illegally to \\"stretch\\" honey. Assays to detect adulteration with HFCS use differential scanning calorimetry and other advanced testing methods.[16][17]\\r\\nIn apiculture in the United States, HFCS is a honey substitute for some managed honey bee colonies during times when nectar is in low supply.[18][19] However, when HFCS is heated to about 45?C (113?F), hydroxymethylfurfural, which is toxic to bees, can form from the breakdown of fructose.[20][21] Although some researchers cite honey substitution with HFCS as one factor among many for colony collapse disorder, there is no evidence that HFCS is a solitary cause.[18][19][22] Further, compared to hive honey, HFCS may be a deficiency in the diet for developing genes associated with protein metabolism and physiological benefits affecting bee health.[19]\\r\\nIn the contemporary process, corn is milled to extract corn starch and an \\"acid-enzyme\\" process is used, in which the corn-starch solution is acidified to begin breaking up the existing carbohydrates.[23] It is necessary to carry out the extraction process in the presence of mercuric chloride (0.01?M) in order to inhibit endogenous starch-degrading enzymes.[24]:374ÿ376 High-temperature enzymes are added to further metabolize the starch and convert the resulting sugars to fructose.[23]:808ÿ813 The first enzyme added is alpha-amylase, which breaks the long chains down into shorter sugar chains ÿ oligosaccharides. Glucoamylase is mixed in and converts them to glucose; the resulting solution is filtered to remove protein, then using activated carbon, and then demineralized using ion-exchange resins. The purified solution is then run over immobilized xylose isomerase, which turns the sugars to ~50ÿ52% glucose with some unconverted oligosaccharides and 42% fructose (HFCS 42), and again demineralized and again purified using activated carbon. Some is processed into HFCS 90 by liquid chromatography, then mixed with HFCS 42 to form HFCS 55. The enzymes used in the process are made by microbial fermentation.[23]:808ÿ813[3]:20ÿ22\\r\\nHFCS is 24% water, the rest being mainly fructose and glucose with 0ÿ5% unprocessed glucose oligomers.[25] There are several varieties of HFCS, numbered by the percentage of fructose they contain:\\r\\nCommercial production of corn syrup began in 1864.[3]:17 In the late 1950s, scientists at Clinton Corn Processing Company of Clinton, Iowa tried to turn glucose from corn starch into fructose, but the process was not scalable.[3]:17[29] In 1965ÿ1970 Yoshiyuki Takasaki, at the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) developed a heat-stable xylose isomerase enzyme from yeast. In 1967, the Clinton Corn Processing Company obtained an exclusive license to a manufacture glucose isomerase derived from Streptomyces bacteria and began shipping an early version of HFCS in February 1967.[3]:140 In 1983, the FDA approved HFCS as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), and that decision was reaffirmed in 1996[30]\\r\\nPrior to the development of the worldwide sugar industry, dietary fructose was limited to only a few items. Milk, meats, and most vegetables, the staples of many early diets, have no fructose, and only 5ÿ10% fructose by weight is found in fruits such as grapes, apples, and blueberries. Most traditional dried fruits, however, contain about 50% fructose. From 1970 to 2000, there was a 25% increase in \\"added sugars\\" in the U.S.[31] After being classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1976,[32] HFCS began to replace sucrose as the main sweetener of soft drinks in the United States. At the same time, rates of obesity rose. That correlation, in combination with laboratory research and epidemiological studies that suggested a link between consuming large amounts of fructose and changes to various proxy health measures, including elevated blood triglycerides, size and type of low-density lipoproteins, uric acid levels, and weight, raised concerns about health effects of HFCS itself.[25]\\r\\nIn the U.S., sugar tariffs and quotas keep imported sugar at up to twice the global price since 1797,[33] while subsidies to corn growers cheapen the primary ingredient in HFCS, corn. Industrial users looking for cheaper replacements rapidly adopted HFCS in the 1970s.[34][35]\\r\\nHFCS is easier to handle than granulated sucrose, although some sucrose is transported as solution. Unlike sucrose, HFCS cannot be hydrolyzed, but the free fructose in HFCS may produce hydroxymethylfurfural when stored at high temperatures; these differences are most prominent in acidic beverages.[36] Soft drink makers such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi continue to use sugar in other nations but transitioned to HFCS for U.S. markets in 1980 before completely switching over in 1984.[37] Large corporations, such as Archer Daniels Midland, lobby for the continuation of government corn subsidies.[38]\\r\\nConsumption of HFCS in the U.S. has declined since it peaked at 37.5?lb (17.0?kg) per person in 1999. The average American consumed approximately 27.1?lb (12.3?kg) of HFCS in 2012,[39] versus 39.0?lb (17.7?kg) of refined cane and beet sugar.[40][41] This decrease in domestic consumption of HFCS resulted in a push in exporting of the product. In 2014, exports of HFCS were valued at $436 million, a decrease of 21% in one year, with Mexico receiving about 75% of the export volume.[7]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Corn Refiners Association petitioned the FDA to call HFCS \\"corn sugar\\", but the petition was denied.[42]\\r\\nIn the European Union (EU), HFCS, known as isoglucose in sugar regime, is subject to a production quota. In 2005, this quota was set at 303,000 tons; in comparison, the EU produced an average of 18.6 million tons of sugar annually between 1999 and 2001.[43]\\r\\nIn Japan, HFCS is manufactured mostly from imported U.S. corn, and the output is regulated by the government. For the period from 2007 to 2012, HFCS had a 27ÿ30% share of the Japanese sweetener market.[44]:21\\r\\nHealth concerns have been raised about a relationship between HFCS and metabolic disorders, and with regard to manufacturing contaminants. In general, however, the United States Food and Drug Administration has declared HFCS as a safe ingredient in food manufacturing, and there is no evidence that retail HFCS products contain harmful compounds or cause diseases.[4][5]\\r\\nHFCS is composed of 76% carbohydrates and 24% water, containing no fat, no protein, and no essential nutrients in significant amounts (table). In a 100 gram serving, it supplies 281 Calories, whereas in one tablespoon of 19 grams, it supplies 53 Calories (table link).\\r\\nSugars became a health concern among the American public in the early 1970s with the publication of John Yudkin's book, Pure, White and Deadly. The book claimed that simple sugars, an increasingly large part of the Western diet, were dangerous.[3]:18 In the 1980s and 1990s were publications cautioning consumption of sucrose and of HFCS.[3]:18[3]:18[45] In subsequent interviews, two of the study's authors stated the article was distorted to place emphasis solely on HFCS when the actual issue was the overconsumption of any type of sugar.[46][47] While fructose absorption and modification by the intestines and liver does differ from glucose initially, the majority of the fructose molecules are converted to glucose or metabolized into byproducts identical to those produced by glucose metabolism. Consumption of moderate amounts of fructose has also been linked to positive outcomes, including reducing appetite if consumed before a meal, lower blood sugar increases compared to glucose, and (again compared to glucose) delaying exhaustion if consumed during exercise.[25]\\r\\nIn 2007, an expert panel assembled by the University of Maryland's Center for Food, Nutrition and Agriculture Policy reviewed the links between HFCS and obesity and concluded there was no ecological validity in the association between rising body mass indexes (a measure of obesity) and the consumption of HFCS. The panel stated that since the ratio of fructose to glucose had not changed substantially in the United States since the 1960s when HFCS was introduced, the changes in obesity rates were probably not due to HFCS specifically, but rather a greater consumption of calories overall.[48] In 2009 the American Medical Association published a review article on HFCS and concluded it was unlikely that HFCS contributed more to obesity or other health conditions than sucrose, and there was insufficient evidence to suggest warning about or restricting use of HFCS or other fructose-containing sweeteners in foods. The review did report that while some studies found direct associations between high intakes of fructose and other sugars and adverse health outcomes, including obesity and the metabolic syndrome, there was insufficient evidence to ban or restrict use of HFCS in the food supply or to require warning labels on products containing HFCS.[49]\\r\\nEpidemiological research has suggested that the increase in metabolic disorders like obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is linked to increased consumption of sugars and/or calories in general and not due to any special effect of HFCS.[25][50][51] A 2014 systematic review found little evidence for an association between HFCS consumption and liver diseases, enzyme levels or fat content.[52] A 2012 review found that fructose did not appear to cause weight gain when it replaced other carbohydrates in diets with similar calories.[53] One study investigating HFCS as a possible contributor to diabetes and obesity states that, \\"As many of the metabolic consequences of a diet high in fructose-containing sugars in humans can also be observed with high-fat or high-glucose feeding, it is possible that excess calories may be the main culprit in the development of the metabolic syndrome.\\"[54] Another study compared similar intakes of honey, white cane sugar, and HFCS, showing similar rises in both blood sugar level and triglycerides.[55] High fructose consumption has been linked to high levels of uric acid in the blood, though this is only thought to be a concern for patients with gout.[25]\\r\\nNumerous agencies in the United States recommend reducing the consumption of all sugars, including HFCS, without singling it out as presenting extra concerns. The Mayo Clinic cites the American Heart Association's recommendation that women limit the added sugar in their diet to 100 calories a day (~6 teaspoons) and that men limit it to 150 calories a day (~9 teaspoons), noting that there is not enough evidence to support HFCS having more adverse health effects than excess consumption of any other type of sugar.[56][57] The United States departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services recommendations for a healthy diet state that consumption of all types of added sugars be reduced.[58]:p.27\\r\\nPeople with fructose malabsorption should avoid foods containing HFCS.[59]\\r\\nSince 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared HFCS to be safe as a food ingredient.[5] In 2015, production of HFCS in the United States was 8.5 million tons from some 500 million bushels of corn.[60]\\r\\nOne consumer concern about HFCS is that processing of corn is more complex than used for simpler or more natural sugars, such as fruit juice concentrates or agave nectar, but all sweetener products derived from raw materials involve similar processing steps of pulping, hydrolysis, enzyme treatment, and filtration, among other common steps of sweetener manufacturing from natural sources.[4][60][61] In the contemporary process to make HFCS, an \\"acid-enzyme\\" step is used in which the cornstarch solution is acidified to digest the existing carbohydrates, then enzymes are added to further metabolize the cornstarch and convert the resulting sugars to their constituents of fructose and glucose.[60][61] Analyses published in 2014 showed that HFCS content of fructose was consistent across samples from 80 randomly selected carbonated beverages sweetened with HFCS.[62]\\r\\nOne prior concern in manufacturing was whether HFCS contains reactive carbonyl compounds or advanced glycation end-products evolved during processing.[63] This concern was dismissed, however, with evidence that HFCS poses no dietary risk from these compounds.[4]\\r\\nThrough the early 21st Century, some factories manufacturing HFCS had used a chlor-alkali corn processing method which, in cases of applying mercury cell technology for digesting corn raw material, left trace residues of mercury in some batches of HFCS.[64] In a 2009 release,[65] The Corn Refiners Association stated that all factories in the American industry for manufacturing HFCS had used mercury-free processing over several previous years, making the prior report outdated.[64] As of 2017, the USDA, FDA and US Centers for Disease Control list HFCS as a safe food ingredient, and do not mention mercury as a safety concern in HFCS products.[5][60][66]\\r\\nSome countries, including Mexico, use sucrose, or table sugar, in soft drinks. In the U.S., soft drinks, including Coca-Cola, are typically made with HFCS. Some Americans seek out drinks such as Mexican Coca-Cola in ethnic groceries because they prefer the taste more than the HFCS-sweetened Coca-Cola.[67][68] Kosher Coca-Cola, sold in the U.S. around the Jewish holiday of Passover, also uses sucrose rather than HFCS and is highly sought after by people who prefer the original taste.[69] While these are simply opinions, a 2011 study further backed up the idea that people enjoy sucrose (table sugar) more than HFCS. The study, conducted by Michigan State University, included a 99-member panel that evaluated yogurt sweetened with sucrose (table sugar), HFCS, and different varieties of honey for likeness. The results showed that, overall, the panel enjoyed the yogurt with sucrose (table sugar) added more than those that contained HFCS or honey.[70]\\r\\nThere are various public relations concerns with HFCS, including how the product is being advertised as well as it being labeled as \\"natural.\\" More concerns include companies that have moved back to sucrose (table sugar) and a proposed name change from \\"high fructose corn syrup\\" to \\"corn sugar.\\" In 2010, the Corn Refiners Association, or CRA, applied to allow HFCS to be renamed \\"corn sugar\\", but was rejected by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2012.[71] The CRA has reportedly spent millions in public relation campaigns in an effort to portray HFCS in a positive light, sometimes without disclosing their involvement in the campaigns. For example, in 2009 the association paid the public relations firm Berman & Company $3.5 million to defend their products. An email sent out by a CRA staff member stated, \\"As you know, our sponsorship of this campaign remains confidential, [. . .] We are funding Berman & Company directly, not the Center for Consumer Freedom, which is running the ads. If asked, please feel free to state the following: 'The Corn Refiners Association is not funding the Center for Consumer Freedom.'\\"[72] This was one of several campaigns that the CRA chose not to disclose their involvement in.\\r\\nMcDonald's reported in August 2016 that, in a move to please health-conscious customers, they would be replacing all HFCS in their buns with sucrose (table sugar). In addition, they would also cut out preservatives and other artificial additives from their menu items. Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald's stated, \\"We know that they [consumers] don't feel good about high-fructose corn syrup so we're giving them what they're looking for instead.\\" [73] Other companies such as Hunt's Ketchup, Gatorade, and Wheat Thins have also phased out HFCS, replacing it with conventional sugar (sucrose). Companies such as PepsiCo and Heinz have also released products that use sucrose (table sugar) in lieu of HFCS, although they still sell the original HFCS-sweetened versions as well.[74]","input":"What are other names for high fructose corn syrup?"},{"output":"Episode VIII","context":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII ÿ The Last Jedi[3]) is an upcoming American epic space opera film written and directed by Rian Johnson.

Disney announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films.[31] J. J. Abrams was named director of the first episode in the trilogy, The Force Awakens, in January 2013.[32][33] In June 2014, director Rian Johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct its sequel, dubbed Episode VIII, and to write a treatment for the third film, Episode IX, with Ram Bergman producing both films.[34][35] Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he would direct Episode VIII.[36] In September, filmmaker Terry Gilliam asked Johnson about what it felt like to take over something that was made famous by another filmmaker, to which Johnson responded:\\r\\nI'm just starting into it, but so far, honestly, it's the most fun I've ever had writing. It's just joyous. But also for me personally, I grew up not just watching those movies but playing with those toys, so as a little kid, the first movies I was making in my head were set in this world. A big part of it is that direct connection, almost like an automatic jacking back into childhood in a weird way. But I don't know, ask me again in a few years and we'll be able to talk about that.[37]\\r\\nAccording to Johnson, the story begins immediately after the last scene of The Force Awakens.[26] He had his story group watch films such as Twelve O'Clock High, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Gunga Din, Three Outlaw Samurai, Sahara, and Letter Never Sent for inspiration while developing ideas.[26][38] He felt it was difficult to work on the film while The Force Awakens was being finished.[26]\\r\\nIn December 2015, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy admitted that \\"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\\". She said that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson and that Johnson would in turn work with (then) Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition.[39] Abrams is an executive producer along with Jason McGatlin and Tom Karnowski.[40]\\r\\nLucasfilm announced the film's title, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, on January 23, 2017.[41]\\r\\nIn September 2015, Disney shortlisted the female cast members to Gina Rodriguez, Tatiana Maslany, and Olivia Cooke.[42] Later that month, Benicio del Toro confirmed that he will play the villain in the film,[43] and Mark Hamill was also confirmed.[5] In October 2015, Gugu Mbatha-Raw was rumored to have been cast in the film.[44] In November, Jimmy Vee was cast as R2-D2.[21] In November, Kennedy announced at the London premiere for The Force Awakens that the entire cast would return for Episode VIII, along with \\"a handful\\" of new cast members.[6] In February 2016, at the start of filming, it was confirmed that Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran had been cast in unspecified roles.[2] In April 2017, at Star Wars Celebration Orlando, Lucasfilm announced that Tran plays Resistance maintenance worker Rose Tico, which Johnson described as the film's largest new role.[13][14]\\r\\nSecond unit photography began during pre-production at Skellig Michael in Ireland on September 14, 2015, due to the difficulties of filming at that location during other seasons. It would have lasted four days,[45][46][47] but filming was canceled for the first day due to poor weather and rough conditions.[48] In November 2014, Ivan Dunleavy, chief executive of Pinewood Studios, confirmed that the film would be shot at Pinewood,[49] with filming also occurring in Mexico.[10] In September 2015, del Toro revealed that principal photography would begin in March 2016;[43] however, Kennedy later stated that filming would begin in January 2016.[6] The production began work on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios on November 15, 2015.[50] Rick Heinrichs served as production designer.[51]\\r\\nIn January 2016, production of Episode VIII was delayed until February 2016, due to script rewrites.[52] Additionally, filming was potentially in danger of being delayed further due to an upcoming strike between the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television and the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union.[53] On February 10, 2016, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that principal photography had begun,[54] under the working title Space Bear.[26] Additional filming took place in Dubrovnik from March 9 to 16, 2016,[55][56] as well as in Ireland in May.[57] Malin Head in County Donegal and a mountain headland, Ceann Sibeal in County Kerry, served as additional filming locations.[58] Principal photography wrapped on July 22, 2016,[59] though as of early September 2016, Nyong'o had not filmed her scenes.[60] In February 2017, it was announced that sequences from the film were shot in IMAX.[61]\\r\\nIn July 2013, Kennedy announced at Star Wars Celebration Europe that John Williams would return to score the Star Wars sequel trilogy.[1][62] At a Tanglewood concert in August 2016, Williams confirmed he is scheduled to start scoring Episode VIII.[63] Williams said he would begin recording the score \\"off and on\\" in December 2016 until March or April 2017.[64] On February 21, 2017, it was confirmed that recording was underway, with Williams conducting.[65]\\r\\nIn January 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Episode VIII would be released in 2017,[66] and in March, Lucasfilm announced a release date of May 26, 2017.[67][68] In January 2016, The Last Jedi was rescheduled for December 15, 2017 in 3D and IMAX 3D.[40][69] On January 23, 2017, the film's title was announced as Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[41] Similarly to The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, \\"Episode VIII\\" will be included in the film's opening crawl, although not in its official title.[70]\\r\\nPre-sale tickets went on sale in the United States on October 9, 2017, and as with The Force Awakens and Rogue One, ticket service sites such as Fandango had their servers crash due to heavy traffic and demand.[71]\\r\\nA set of eight promotional postage stamps were released on October 12, 2017 in the UK by the Royal Mail with artwork by Malcolm Tween.[72] On September 19, 2017, the Australia Post released a set stamp packs in the country.[73]\\r\\nEpisode IX, the final installment of the sequel trilogy, is scheduled to be released on December 20, 2019.[74] Prior to her death in December 2016, Carrie Fisher had been expected to appear in Episode IX.[75][76] Though Fisher's family granted the rights to use recent footage of Fisher for Star Wars: Episode IX,[77] Fisher will not appear in the film[78][79] and Lucasfilm will not digitally generate new footage of her.[80] Principal photography of Star Wars: Episode IX is set to begin in January 2018.[81][82] On September 5, 2017, Lucasfilm announced that Trevorrow had stepped down as director.[83] A week later, Lucasfilm announced that J.

National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress. A bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \\"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\\"[2] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act before being upgraded by Congress. Seven national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. Criteria for the selection of national parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (though these criteria are not always considered together). National monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[3] while 21 national parks are designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR).[4] Eight national parks are designated in both UNESCO programs.\\r\\nTwenty-eight states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the United States Virgin Islands.

The largest national park is WrangellÿSt. Elias in Alaska: at over 8?million acres (32,375?km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at approximately 192.83 acres (0.7804?km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.2?million acres (211,000?km2), for an average of 870?thousand acres (3,500?km2) but a median of only 229?thousand acres (930?km2).[5]\\r\\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2017, with more than 84 million visitors.[6] The most-visited national park is Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, with over 11.3 million visitors in 2017, followed by Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, with over 6.2 million.

It is one of the largest tourist attractions in San Diego County. The park houses a large array of wild and endangered animals including species from the continents of Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. The park is in a semi-arid environment, and one of its most notable features is the Africa Tram which explores the expansive African exhibits. These free-range enclosures house such animals as antelopes, giraffes, buffalo, cranes, and rhinoceros. The park is also noted for its California condor breeding program, the most successful such program in the United States.\\r\\nThe park, visited by 2 million people annually, houses over 2,600 animals representing more than 300 species, as well as 3,500 plant species.[4]\\r\\nDepending on the season, the park has about 400 to 600 employees. The park is also Southern California's quarantine center for zoo animals imported into the United States through San Diego.\\r\\nThe park has the world's largest veterinary hospital.[citation needed] Next door to the hospital is the Institute for Conservation Research which holds the park's Frozen Zoo.\\r\\nBoth the park and the San Diego Zoo are run by the Zoological Society of San Diego. The park is 32 miles (51?km) away from the zoo, at 15500 San Pasqual Valley Road east of Escondido, California, along California State Route 78. Although the park is primarily within the San Diego city limits,[6] it has an Escondido address.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Diego Zoological Society became interested in developing the Wild Animal Park in 1964. The idea of the park began as a supplementary breeding facility for the San Diego Zoo, which would allow ample space for large animals and ungulates.\\r\\nThe development proposed would differ significantly from that of a typical zoo in that animals would be exhibited in a natural environment rather than in cages. In 1964, the park was assessed financially and then moved onto the next phase; this resulted in three alternative developments. There was an idea for a conservation farm, a game preserve, and a natural environment zoo. The natural environment zoo development was chosen over the conservation farm and game preserve even though it was the most expensive option. The estimated initial cost was $1,755,430.[7]\\r\\nThe main purposes of this zoo were to be species conservation, breeding of animals for the San Diego Zoo as well as other zoos and providing areas where zoo animals could be conditioned. When it came to naming the park, five titles were considered: San Diego Animal Land, San Diego Safari Land, San Diego Wild Animal Safari, San Diego Wildlife Park and San Diego Wild Animal Park.[7]\\r\\nThe scheduled opening day of the park was set for April 1, 1972; however, the gates did not open until Wednesday May 10, 1972.[7] The general layout of the park, designed by Charles Faust, included a large lagoon with a jungle plaza, an African fishing village, an aviary at the entrance of the park and approximately 50,000 plants were to be included in the landscaping.[7] Although the park was scheduled to open in three years from the time of the groundbreaking, the total development of the park was estimated to take ten years.\\r\\nThe first two animals to arrive at the park were the nilgai, an antelope from the plains of North India, and the black-and-white striped Grant's zebra, native to East Africa.[7]\\r\\nIn the summer of 2003, the San Diego Zoological Society and Lowry Park Zoo orchestrated the capture of 11 wild African elephants from the Hlane Royal National Park in Swaziland. The zoos said the animals were scheduled to be killed due to overpopulation.[8] However, In Defense of Animals disputes this, claiming that new fencing costing many times less than the capture and transport would have ended the need to remove any elephants from Swaziland, and that the Save Wild Elephants Coalition reported that there were three other sanctuaries in Africa that had offered to take the elephants.[9]\\r\\nFive of these elephants are now at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park,[8] and cumulatively they have produced thirteen babies as of 2013.[10][11] In March 2012 five elephants were moved to the Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona, to form a new herd. A bull elephant, two cows, and two baby bulls were moved and in return two cow elephants that had been together for years. Connie, an Asian elephant, and Shaba, an African elephant, were sent to the San Diego Zoo.[12] Connie died from cancer in July 2012 just five months after the move. Shaba was slowly introduced into the herd in February 2013.[13]\\r\\nThe California wildfires that officially started on October 21, 2007, burned 600 acres (2.4?km2) of native habitat preserved in the park and caused it to temporarily close. The park also moved many of their endangered animals out of danger. The fire did not reach any of the main enclosures, and no animals were killed directly by the fire, although deaths of a clapper rail and kiang were attributed to indirect effects of the blaze.\\r\\nOn June 30, 2010 the San Diego Zoo board of trustees voted to change the name of the park from the Wild Animal Park to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to clarify what it offers, since some visitors were unclear as to the difference between the zoo proper and the \\"animal park\\". The name \\"safari\\" is supposed to emphasize \\"the park's spacious enclosures of free-ranging animals\\" (as opposed to \\"the closer quarters of the zoo\\"), encouraging visits to both locations.[14]\\r\\nThe park's largest exhibits, covering over 300 acres (120?ha),[15] are the open-range enclosures. Visitors view various plains habitats from Africa and Asia. Asian Savanna covers 60 acres (24?ha) and displays Indian rhinoceros, Przewalski's horses, and several species of Asian deer and antelope such as blackbuck, barasingha, axis deer, nilgai and wapiti.[15] African Plains represents many regions and habitats. East Africa displays cape buffalo, southern white rhinoceros, Rothschild's giraffe, several other savanna species, and a lagoon with East African crowned cranes[15] The North Africa exhibit represents the Sahel and Sahara that houses scimitar-horned oryx, barbary stag, red-fronted gazelle, and Ankole-Watusi cattle.[15] The Southern Africa field exhibits Grvy's zebras.[16] The Central Africa region features a wooded waterhole with an island for pink-backed pelicans, saddle-billed storks, and Rppell's vultures. On the shores of the lake are bongo antelope, red river hogs, and Vaal rheboks, and other forest animals.[16] A number of smaller enclosures visible only from the tram are home to Somali wild ass, kiangs (one of the world's only captive populations of this endangered wild equine)[citation needed], Arabian oryx, gorals, Japanese serows, black rhinoceroses, and Przewalski's horses.\\r\\nSpecies of note in the open enclosures include two subspecies of giraffe, rhinos (the park has the world's most successful breeding program for southern white rhinos[citation needed] and was the last New World zoo to have northern white rhinoceros), gaur, vultures, markhor, and many species of antelope, gazelle, and deer.\\r\\nThe tigers have three different exhibits, and there is a glass viewing window for visitors.[17][18] After raising $19.6 million for the new exhibit ground was broken on December 12, 2012. The new exhibit is named the Tull Family Tiger Trail after movie producer Thomas Tull and his wife.[19] Tiger Trail opened May 24, 2014.\\r\\nThe park's Nairobi Village houses numerous exhibits for smaller animals. Among these are meerkats, an African aviary, lemurs, flamingos, red river hogs, and bee eaters.[20] A large lagoon is home to numerous species of waterfowl such as shoebill storks.[20] Lorikeet Landing and Hidden Jungle display feedable Lories and lorikeets, and African birds, respectively. There is a nursery where visitors can watch baby animals being hand-reared as well as a nearby petting corral.[20] Finally, a gorilla habitat houses a troop of western lowland gorillas.[20] A flying fox bat exhibit also located there.\\r\\nLocated in Nairobi Village, this climate-controlled indoor exhibit opened in 1993[21] and displays tropical African birds and insects.[22] The entrance to the building is a simulated earthen crevasse with displays for stick insects and arachnids.[21] The underground segment opens up to a room representing the rainforest understory, which leads to a second room representing the canopy. On display are long-tailed paradise whydah, purple grenadier, and other birds.[22]\\r\\nHidden Jungle is the setting of the annual Butterfly Jungle event.[22]\\r\\nOpened in October 2004, Lion camp houses the park's thirteen African lions in a 1-acre (0.40?ha) exhibit.[23] One side of the enclosure is dominated by an artificial rock kopje which has a 40-foot-long (12?m) glass viewing window and heated rocks.[23] The path continues along an acacia-studded ravine and leads to a replica observation tent. This has a smaller viewing window as well as a Land Rover for the lions to rest on.\\r\\nCondor Ridge displays endangered North American desert wildlife.[24] The featured species are California condors[24] (the Wild Animal Park was the key force in the recovery effort for these birds and this is one of the only places in the world where the public can see them in captivity) and desert bighorn sheep.[24] Other species displayed include aplomado falcons, thick-billed parrots, bald eagles, prairie dogs, black footed ferrets, magpies, ocelots, porcupines, and desert tortoises.[24]\\r\\nFormerly known as Heart of Africa, these are two of the park's major exhibits. Visitors go down a trail which replicates habitats in Africa. The exhibit begins in African Woods with scrub animals - vultures, lesser kudu, and giant eland. It then progresses to forest (okapi, duikers, and wattled cranes). The path then leads to African Outpost, which features plains animals - bontebok, common warthogs, ground hornbills, and cheetahs - against a backdrop of the open-range East Africa exhibit. A central lagoon has lesser and greater flamingos, waterfowl, an island with colobus monkeys, and an interpretive research camp on a separate island.\\r\\nThe park formerly operated a monorail line, the Wgasa Bush Line, which ran through the Wild Animal Park. The name of the monorail was chosen by chief designer Chuck Faust.\\r\\nThe Monorail line has been retired, partially due to high maintenance costs, and in March 2007 the Journey into Africa attraction, now renamed Africa Tram, opened. The Africa Tram tour brings visitors to the field exhibits to see wildlife from different parts of Africa. In addition, another route is planned to bring visitors through the Asian field exhibits and into eight new ones that will house a variety of African animals from rock hyrax to Hartmann's mountain zebras. The tour utilizes a wheeled tram that runs on biofuel instead of a monorail.\\r\\nAs well as the tram, the park has also added a tethered balloon ride that allows visitors to see the plains exhibits from 400 feet (120?m) in the air.[25] The balloon ride is not included in the entrance fee.\\r\\nThe park also has extensive botanical gardens, many of which are their own attractions separate from the animal exhibits.\\r\\nThe Safari Park was a major factor in the recovery of the California condor. Beginning in 1980, it worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Los Angeles Zoo to start a captive breeding program.[26] The last 22 condors were taken into captivity in 1987[26] To breed the condors quickly, the Safari Park would remove the eggs from the nests to induce the females to lay a second egg.[26][27] The removed egg hatches in an incubator and is raised with a condor handpuppet to prevent human imprinting, while the second egg is raised by its parents.[26][27] Captive-bred condors were reintroduced into the wild beginning in 1992, and today their population is 369, with 191 in the wild as of March 2011.[26]\\r\\nOn December 14, 2014, Angalifu, a 44-year-old male northern white rhinoceros, died at the park. This left only five northern white rhinos left in the world, including one female at the Safari Park.[28] On November 22,2015, the park's last Northern White Rhino, Nola was euthanized due to bacterial infection and her health rapidly declining\\r\\nThe Safari Park has received several awards for its breeding programs and conservation efforts.","input":"How many acres is the san diego safari park?"},{"output":"steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone","context":"","input":"What kind of substance is an anabolic-androgenic steroid?"},{"output":"the InterContinental Hotels Group","context":"Crowne Plaza is a chain of full service, upscale hotels catering to business travelers and to the meetings and conventions market.

There are two main markets for citrus fruit:\\r\\nMost citrus production is accounted for by oranges, but significant quantities of grapefruits, pomeloes, lemons and limes are also grown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the origin of citrus fruits cannot be precisely identified, researchers believe they began to appear in Southeast Asia at least 4,000 BC. From there, they slowly spread to northern Africa, mainly through migration and trade. During the period of the Roman Empire demand by higher-ranking members of society, along with increased trade, allowed the fruits to spread to southern Europe. Citrus fruits spread throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, and were then brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers. Worldwide trade in citrus fruits didn't appear until the 20th century and trade in orange juice developed as late as 1940.[1]\\r\\nTotal production and consumption of citrus fruit has grown strongly since the 1980s. Current annual worldwide citrus production is estimated at over 70 million tons, with more than half of this being oranges[citation needed]. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the rise in citrus production is mainly due to the increase in cultivation areas, improvements in transportation and packaging, rising incomes and consumer preference for healthy foods.\\r\\nThis trend was projected to change from 2000 to 2010 since the high production levels have slowed the rate of new plantings.[1]\\r\\nCitrus fruits are produced all over the world. According to UNCTAD, in 2004 there were 140 citrus producing countries. Around 70% of the world's total citrus production is grown in the Northern Hemisphere, in particular countries around the Mediterranean and the United States, although Brazil is the largest citrus producer.\\r\\nIn the United States, most orange juice and grapefruit is produced in Florida, while citrus fruits for consumption as fresh fruit are mainly grown in California, Arizona and Texas. Smaller markets for citrus growth in the US originate in South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and the gulf coastal states, including Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, as well as North Carolina. Independent cultivars are found in Kentucky, Virginia, and even Missouri, Southern Illinois, and far Southern Kansas. The farther north the range, the more seasonal the cultivation. [2] Florida produces approximately 100 million boxes annually (each box is 90 lbs).[3]\\r\\nChina could be a major player in the orange juice and processed citrus markets, except for high tariffs on citrus that make domestic sale more profitable. Though citrus originated in southeast Asia, current citrus production is low due to lower than average yields, high production and marketing costs and problems with disease.[4]\\r\\nCitrus production in most of Europe continues to decline, although the clementines produced by Spain are increasing in popularity among consumers.[5]\\r\\nAbout a third of citrus fruit production goes for processing: more than 80% of this is for orange juice production. Demand for fresh and processed oranges continues to rise in excess of production, especially in developed countries([7]).\\r\\nThe two main players are Florida in the United States and S?o Paulo in Brazil. Production of orange juice between these two makes up roughly 85 percent of the world market. Brazil exports 99 percent of its production, while 90 percent of Floridas production is consumed in the US.[2]\\r\\nOrange juice is traded internationally in the form of frozen concentrated orange juice to reduce the volume used, so that storage and transportation costs are lower.[5]\\r\\nCitrus production is often cut short in many areas by outbreaks of bacteria known as Xanthomonas axonopodis, or Citrus canker, which cause unsightly lesions on all parts of the plant, affecting tree vitality and early drop of fruit. While not harmful to human consumption, the fruit becomes too unsightly to be sold, and entire orchards are often destroyed to protect the outbreak from spreading.[8]\\r\\nCitrus canker affects all varieties of citrus trees, and recent outbreaks in Australia, Brazil and the United States have slowed citrus production in parts of those countries. Citrus leafminer moths are a major concern where citrus canker exists. The openings created by citrus leafminer make the tree highly susceptible to the X. axonopodis bacteria which leads to citrus canker.\\r\\nHuanglongbing (HLB), called citrus greening within the industry, is recognized as the deadliest citrus disease the Florida citrus industry has ever faced.[9] This can be attributed to the economic costs of implementing new care-taking strategies, and overall tree loss creating a loss of revenues.[10] A look at total Florida citrus growing acreage provides a tangible impression to the hardships citrus greening provides; in 2000 there was 665,529 commercially producing citrus acres, while in 2011 there were 473,086 commercially producing citrus acres in Florida.[11] Every year citrus reports indicate a continued loss of citrus production. Citrus greening is being attributed for a total output impact of -4.51 billion, and a loss of 8,257 jobs within the state of Florida.[10] The disease has now spread throughout the entire state, and affects every Florida citrus grower.[12] The disease is spread through an insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid. The psyllid was previously introduced into Florida in 1998. At this time citrus greening was never found within the state, thus the psyllids spread was left unchecked. By the time citrus greening had reached Florida psyllid populations were well established throughout the state of Florida. The first positive case of greening disease was in August 2005, when a greening positive citrus tree was discovered in Miami-Dade County. It was at this time the entire Florida citrus industry changed its citriculture practices overnight. Intensive pesticide applications, aggressive removal of citrus greening positive trees, and the complete switch from outdoor to indoor citrus nursery operations transpired.[11]\\r\\nSymptoms of citrus greening are numerous, and can be varied in citrus trees. A tree will develop yellow shoots instead of the expected deep green colors. The disease presents itself on the leaves by giving an asymmetrical blotchy-mottle appearance. This is the key diagnosing characteristic of citrus greening. On affected limbs, fruit tend to be lopsided. The fruit will also never ripen and have a sour taste, making them unmarketable for both juice and fresh fruit productions. In later stages of infection the tree will suffer from heavy leaf drop, high percentages of fruit drop, and deep twig die back. A greening positive citrus trees canopies will be airy due to the defoliation the disease causes.[12] After a tree becomes infected with citrus greening it becomes uneconomical and may die within 2ÿ5 years.[13]\\r\\nVector control of citrus greening began when the disease was first introduced in 2005. All commercial citrus growers are advised in applying two dormancy pesticide sprays. These broad-spectrum pesticide sprays are applied in winter when adult psyllid populations decline to almost exclusive overwintering adults. With this strategy, significant reductions of populations withhold for up to 6 months. This fact is crucial as it protects the spring flush, which accounts for over 70% of new leaves for the year, from the infectious psyllid attacks. The spring flush typically occurs 3 months past winter.[14] More aggressive citrus grove care-takers may employ a wide host of pesticides to try to keep psyllid populations low year round. These growers may spray pesticides up to 7 times a year rotating various pesticides to employ different modes of actions against the psyllid.[15] This is done in an attempt to prevent resistances of psyllids to the various pesticides. The spraying of pesticides is the only method of control for the citrus greening vector, the psyllid. It is impossible to kill all psyllids through pesticides, thus strategic timing of pesticide sprays are done to try and slow the gradual spread of HLB throughout the citrus grove. Unfortunately, at this time it is inevitable that a commercial citrus grove will reach 100 percent infection rates even with aggressive sprays.[13]\\r\\nProductivity of a citrus groves can be retained at pre-Huanglongbing levels through a three pronged strategy. Current research is aimed at the goal of giving the greatest yields for the lowest costs. Indeed, these lower costs are necessitated by the increased per acre cost of caretaking brought upon by Huanglongbing infection. Huanglongbing forces the commercial citrus caretaker to spray his/her block of citrus many more times a year than normal, considerably increasing costs. Per pound prices of citrus must continue increasing for citrus to remain profitable due to disease pressure.[14]\\r\\nFoliar fertilizers are now being sprayed on citrus trees at considerably higher rates than before citrus greening disease. Inspiration for the mixture of foliar nutrients was drawn from a local citrus grower, Maury Boyd. Mr. Boyd was the first to try a strategy of not removing greening positive citrus trees, and instead attempt aggressive nutritional sprays. His grove was as a result the first to remain economical with a high percentage rate of greening disease infection. His spray program is under considerable research by the University of Floridas IFAS department. Further research is still needed, and being carried out to determine which specific fertilizer compounds, and the quantities used are the most efficient.[14]\\r\\nVector control of the psyllid, which is the sole means for citrus greening to spread is now done routinely. Before citrus greening disease was introduced, commercial citrus growers did not have to spray pesticides targeting insects. Current research is aimed at pesticide application timing, and pesticide choice for efficacy.[14]\\r\\nAfter the introduction of citrus greening disease, all commercial nurseries, where new young trees are purchased, were relocated indoors and a bud wood registration program was enacted. Previously young citrus trees were grown outdoors before disease pressure became an issue. This is to certify that Florida grove owners are able to purchase clean citrus trees for the planting of citrus groves. A greening positive young citrus tree will never reach maturity, even with intensive sprays.[11]\\r\\nThese three keystone citriculture practices vector control, foliar nutrition, and certified young trees make up the new best management practices for commercial citrus growers against the citrus greening disease fight.[11]\\r\\nNitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus are the main macronutrients needed in citrus production, as well as Calcium, Magnesium and Sulfur.[16]\\r\\nNitrogen is important for overall tree and leaf growth and peel thickness, and fruit acidity.\\r\\nPhosphorus improves root growth, fruit yield and weight and juice while it reduces peel thickness.\\r\\nPotassium maintains fruit size, acidity, juice and disease tolerance, and it is taken up largely by the citrus fruit; too little K can lead to splitting and plugging of the fruit.[16]\\r\\nBoron is involved in many enzymatic systems, when it is deficient, the tree suffers in fruit and leaf quality, and the tree loses apical dominance.\\r\\nCopper affects photosynthesis and fruit set. Deficiency causes drooping of shoots, \\"brown gum\\" eruptions, and death may occur from the tip. If copper based fungicides are used, this is not usually a problem.\\r\\nActing as a catalyst for reactions, this element is a cofactor for many enzymes, important for sweetness, increasing total soluble solids and boosting vitamin C and juice content for fruit. Iron deficiency is the most common of the micronutrients, causing symptoms of increased prominence of leaf veins and leaves turning white.\\r\\nDeficiency is associated with zinc and iron reductions as well, causing a mottled yellowing of the leaf, almost of a variegated quality. It improves overall sugar production in fruit juice.","input":"Where are oranges mostly grown in the world?"},{"output":"Mitchell Kupchak","context":"Mitchell Kupchak (born May 24, 1954) is an American former basketball player and the former general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKupchak played for Brentwood High School in New York.[1] He was an All-American on the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team,[2] and was named Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in his senior season.[3] Kupchak played on the gold medal-winning team at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.[4]\\r\\nKupchak was drafted by the Washington Bullets in 1976 and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. He had four productive seasons with Washington and was part of the team that won the NBA championship in 1978. He signed a long term contract with the Lakers in 1981 at the behest of Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, who told owner Jerry Buss, \\"If we could get Mitch Kupchak, I know we could win\\", after the team's playoff upset.[5] Unfortunately, 26 games into the season, Kupchak injured his knee and did not play again until the 1983ÿ84 season.\\r\\nHowever, Kupchak played a key role in the Showtime Lakers' 1985 championship team against the Boston Celtics, who had intimidated them in the prior year's Finals. Kupchak retired after the 1985ÿ86 season, having played 510 regular season and 68 playoff games, with regular season averages of 10.2 points per game and 5.4 rebounds per game (7.7 points per game and 4.7 rebounds per game in the playoffs). During his final game, Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, a brawl broke out between the Lakers and the Houston Rockets, which saw Kupchak and Hakeem Olajuwon ejected.[citation needed]\\r\\nKupchak showed remarkable forethought in planning for his \\"life after\\" being an NBA playerpursuing a focused program to learn the trade of running NBA team operations. While still under his initial player contract, he worked with the front office, developing strong working relationships with Laker management, beginning to \\"apprentice\\" with Jerry West, and starting studies that led to his MBA from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 1987.[citation needed]\\r\\nKupchak retired from playing in 1986, and became the Lakers' assistant general manager (under GM and Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry West). He later succeeded West as General Manager, but was not considered to have all of the traditional powers of an NBA GM until 2000 (when West resigned as Vice President of Basketball Operations, for the challenge of trying to replicate the Lakers' level of success as GM of the recently relocated, last-place Memphis Grizzlies).\\r\\nOn July 16, 2003, after the Lakers failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in 3 years, Kupchak's first major deal was the off-season acquisitions of superstars Karl Malone and Gary Payton (who had both failed to win an NBA championship despite long, Hall of Fame-caliber careers).[6] After a number of controversial trade transactions over the years, including the trade of Shaquille O'Neal to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, and Brian Grantas well as the decision to not trade young center Andrew Bynum for point guard Jason KiddKupchak faced severe criticism from Lakers franchise star Kobe Bryant, who urged his firing. However, Kupchak reportedly still had the support of the team's owner.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2007, Kupchak traded Brian Cook and Maurice Evans for Trevor Ariza, and the Lakers started the season off with the best record in the west. After an injury to Andrew Bynum cast their recent success in doubt, his February 2008 deal to obtain Spanish Power Forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, and draft picks (one of which was the right to Marc Gasol) earned him praise (and scorn) from league insiders and fans alike. Bryant later conceded, \\"He goes from a[n] F to an A-plus.\\",[5] while Gregg Popovich, coach of Western Conference rival San Antonio Spurs, went so far as to argue that \\"there should be a trade committee that can scratch all trades that make no sense\\".[7] That year, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals for the 5th time in 9 years, but would eventually lose to the Boston Celtics. The following year, they returned and won in a 4-1 rout over the Orlando Magic.\\r\\nIn 2009, Kupchak signed 2004 Defensive Player of the Year Ron Artest, famous for his role in the Pacers-Pistons Brawl, as a free agent. The Lakers made it to their seventh NBA Finals in 11 years, winning in a championship re-match against the Celtics in the 2010 NBA Finals. 2011 saw the retirement of longtime coach Phil Jackson, replacing him with Mike Brown, as well as an attempted three-team trade of Odom and Gasol to the Houston Rockets, in exchange for the New Orleans Hornets' All-Star point guard, Chris Paul[8] Because the Hornets (a financial failure for its previous owners) was still owned by the NBA, Commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade for unspecified \\"basketball reasons\\"leaving the Lakers with a publicly disgruntled Odom, and shocked Gasol (both of whom intended to end their careers as Lakers, and had not known that they were about to be traded).[9]\\r\\nOn July 4, 2012, after two consecutive playoff exits in the semi-final round, Kupchak used a traded player exception (gained by trading Odom to the Dallas Mavericks) on two-time, former NBA Most Valuable Player, Steve Nash. The deal to get Nash in a Laker uniform was finalized for a package of future draft picks and cash considerations.[10] That same summer, Kupchak dealt Andrew Bynum, who had just been voted to his first All-Star team, in a four-way trade for his Eastern Conference counterpart, three-time Defensive Player of the Year Dwight Howard.[11] The move was announced August 10, 2012. But the flurry of personnel changes did not stop there: Kupchak had also convinced former All-Star and Sixth Man of the Year winner Antawn Jamison to sign for a veteran-minimum contract. He later, along with owner Jerry Buss and Vice President of Basketball Operations Jim Buss (Jerry's son), also fired defense-minded head coach Mike Brown and replaced him with Nash's former head coach, offense-minded Mike D'Antoni.[12][13]\\r\\nDuring the 2013ÿ14 season, Kupchak and the Lakers gave Kobe Bryant a 2-year, $48.5 million extension despite him being out due to an Achilles injury. The deal was reportedly endorsed by team president Jeanie Buss. Mike D'Antoni resigned after the season, leaving Kupchak and Jim Buss the task of hiring a 3rd coach in 4 years. They decided on former Lakers point guard Byron Scott. The Lakers announced in April 2014 that Kupchak's own contract had been extended for multiple years. It was scheduled to expire after the 2014 season. Terms of the contract were not released.[14]\\r\\nOn February 21, 2017, Kupchak was fired as general manager of the Lakers.[15]\\r\\nIn 2002, Kupchak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.[16][17] He is married to Claire, with whom he had two children.[18] His daughter, Alina Claire Kupchak, died on January 5, 2015, after a lengthy illness.[19][20] His son Maxwell is a forward on the UC Santa Barbara basketball team.[21]","input":"Who is the general manager of the los angeles lakers?"},{"output":"a red Italian wine","context":"Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is a red Italian wine made from the Montepulciano wine grape in the Abruzzo region of east-central Italy.[1] It should not be confused with Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, a Tuscan wine made from Sangiovese and other grapes.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nMontepulciano d'Abruzzo was classified as Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) in 1968; a separate Denominazione di origine controllata e Garantita (DOCG) for wine produced around Teramo, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane (Teramo hills), was established in 1995 and promoted in 2003.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as one of the most widely exported DOC wines in Italy.[4]\\r\\nIt is typically dry with soft tannins and often consumed young.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Montepulciano, up to 15% Sangiovese is permitted in the blend. Wines aged by the maker for more than two years may be labeled \\"Riserva.\\" [5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DOC region for Montepulciano d'Abruzzo covers a vast expanse of land in the Abruzzo region between the Apennines foothills down to a few miles inland from the Adriatic coast.[2] The region is one of Italy's most mountainous with more than 65% of all Abruzzo being considered mountainous terrain with the Apennines peaks reaching up to 9000 feet above sea level. The hillside vineyards planted on calcareous clay benefit from warm and significant sun exposure that is ventilated by dry breezes coming off the Adriatic.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMontepulciano is produced in all four provinces of Abruzzo--L'Aquila, Chieti, Pescara and Teramowith the southern fertile province of Chieti producing the largest total quantity of wine. The mountainous province of L'Aquila is noted mainly for the dry rosato wine labeled as Cerasuolo produced in the DOC. The most favorable vineyards are planted in the northern provinces of Pescara and Teramo with the later having its own DOCG designation above Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.[6] These northern provinces benefit from having less fertile soils with more ferrous clay and limestone mix and higher elevations as the Apennines draw closer to the Adriatic. This creates cooler micro-climates that tend to produce more concentrated wines.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, there were approximately 18,000 acres (7,300?ha) planted in the DOC.[3] In 2005, the DOC produced over 500,000 hectoliters of wine, with more than two thirds of it being produced in the Chieti province.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Italian wine laws, the wine must be composed of a minimum of 85% Montepulciano with up to 15% of Sangiovese permitted to fill out the remainder of the wine. Grapes are harvested to a yield no greater than 14 tonnes per hectare.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wine must be aged for a minimum of 5 months prior to release with bottles labeled as Vecchio further aged a minimum of two years in wood barrels. Additionally, all Montepulciano d'Abruzzo wines must have a minimum alcohol level of at least 12%.[3] It can also be produced in a lighter rosato style, which since 2010 is a separate DOC called Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo DOC region is the smaller Colline Teramane (Teramo hills) DOCG that is produced in the province of Teramo from vineyards planted in Teramo and 30 surrounding communes. Established first as a DOC in 1995, the region was promoted to DOCG status in 2003.[4] The regulations for the wine are similar to Montepulciano d'Abruzzo except that the wine needs to be made from a minimum of 90% Montepulciano with a maximum of 10% Sangiovese permitted.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to wine expert Oz Clarke, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is often a deeply colored wine with pepper and spice notes. It can be described as \\"rustic\\" which Clarke says is less pronounced when the wine is paired with food.[2] Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan describes the wines as aromatic, tannic and with low acidity.[6] According to Italian wine expert Joe Bastianich, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo's can be highly aromatic with earthy notes and black berries and have inky-purple color with a thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is often consumed young, the wine does have some aging potential with producers such as Stefano Illuminati of the Controguerra winery Illuminati noting that the wine doesn't really change much in 10 years which can have its benefits and disadvantages because \\"on one hand, you open a well-aged Montepulciano and it is still fresh and full-bodied. On the other hand, you don't always get the more complex secondary aromas that develop with age.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ros (rosato) style of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is labeled as Cerasuolo which means \\"cherry-red\\" and relates to the deep color the wine gets even with very brief skin-contact with the highly pigmented skins of the Montepulciano grape. According to Bastianich, Cerasuolo tend to be medium-bodied and rather hearty for an Italian rosato with aromas of orange peel, cinnamon, strawberry and dried cherries.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 a new DOC classification was created for the wine, known as Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo.[7] The term Cerasuolo can also refer to Cerasuolo di Vittoria, an unrelated DOCG dry red wine from Sicily made from Nero d'Avola and Frappato.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Montepulciano d'Abruzzo at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What kind of wine is montepulciano d abruzzo?"},{"output":"unclear","context":"\\"Cotton-Eye Joe\\" (also known as \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\") is a traditional American country folk song popular at various times throughout the United States and Canada, although today it is most commonly associated with the American South. In the Roud index of folksongs it is No. 942.\\r\\n\\"Cotton-Eye Joe\\" has inspired both a partner dance and more than one line dance that is often danced at country dance venues in the U.S. and around the world. The 1980 film Urban Cowboy sparked a renewed interest in the dance. In 1985, The Moody Brothers' version of the song received a Grammy Award nomination for \\"Best Country Instrumental Performance\\". Irish group The Chieftains received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Country Vocal Collaboration\\" for their version of the song with lead vocals by Ricky Skaggs on their 1992 album, Another Country.

Scarborough's account of the song came from her sister, Mrs. George Scarborough, who learned the song from \\"the Negroes on a plantation in Texas, and other parts from a man in Louisiana.\\" The man in Louisiana knew the song from his earliest childhood and heard slaves singing it on plantations.[2] Both the dance and the song had many variants.[3] The first printed one dates from 1882[4]. American publishing house Harper and Brothers published a version in 1882, heard by author Louise Clarke Pyrnelle (born 1850) on the Alabama plantation of her father when she was a child,[5] that was later republished in 1910:[6]\\r\\n\\"Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nWhat did make you sarve me so,\\r\\nFur ter take my gal erway fum me,\\r\\nAn' cyar her plum ter Tennessee?\\r\\nEf it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nI'd er been married long ergo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"His eyes wuz crossed, an' his nose wuz flat,\\r\\nAn' his teef wuz out, but wat uv dat?\\r\\nFur he wuz tall, an' he wuz slim,\\r\\nAn' so my gal she follered him.\\r\\nEf it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nI'd er been married long ergo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"No gal so hansum could be foun',\\r\\nNot in all dis country roun',\\r\\nWid her kinky head, an' her eyes so bright,\\r\\nWid her lips so red an' her teef so white.\\r\\nEf it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nI'd been married long ergo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"An' I loved dat gal wid all my heart,\\r\\nAn' she swo' fum me she'd never part;\\r\\nBut den wid Joe she runned away,\\r\\nAn' lef' me hyear fur ter weep all day.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Cotton-eyed Joe, O Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nWhat did make you sarve me so?\\r\\nO Joe, ef it hadn't er ben fur you,\\r\\nI'd er married dat gal fur true.\\"\\r\\nBy 1884, the same year Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was published, the fiddle-based song was referred to as \\"an old, familiar air.\\"[7] In 1925, another version was recorded by folklorist Dorothy Scarborough and published.[8]\\r\\nDon't you remember, don't you know,\\r\\nDon't you remember Cotton-eyed Joe?\\r\\nCotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nWhat did make you treat me so?\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nEf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe!\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe,\\r\\nHe was de nig dat sarved me so, \\r\\nTuck my gal away fum me,\\r\\nCarried her off to Tennessee.\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nIf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHi's teeth was out an' his nose was flat,\\r\\nHis eyes was crossed,  but she did n't mind dat.\\r\\nKase he was tall, and berry slim,\\r\\nAn' so my gal she follered him.\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nEf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was de prettiest gal to be found\\r\\nAnywhar in de country round;\\r\\nHer lips was red an' her eyes was bright,\\r\\nHer skin was black but her teeth was white.\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty year ago\\r\\nEf it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nDat gal, she sho' had all my love,\\r\\nAn swore fum ne she'd never move,\\r\\nBut Joe hoodooed her, don't you see,\\r\\nAn' she run off wid him to Tennessee,\\r\\nI'd 'a' been married forty years ago,\\r\\nEf it hadn't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe.\\"\\r\\nScarborough noted that the song seemed to be well known in the South prior to the Civil War, and parts of it had been sent in by various persons.[8]\\r\\nOver the years, many different versions of the song have been performed and/or recorded with many different versions of the lyrics (and many without lyrics). \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\", on occasion referred to as \\"The South Texas National Anthem\\", was played for minstrel-type jigs, and it has long been popular as a square dance hoedown and a couple dance polka.[9]\\r\\nA resident of Central Texas who learned the dance in Williamson County in the early 1880s described it as nothing but a heel and toe \\"poker\\" with fringes added. These fringes added to the heel and toe polka were clog steps which required skill and extraversion on the part of the dancer.[10]\\r\\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century the song was a widely known folk song all over English-speaking North America.

This dance was adapted into a simplified version as a nonpartner waist-hold, spoke line routine. Heel and toe polka steps were replaced with a cross-lift followed by a kick with two-steps. The lift and kick are sometimes accompanied by shouts of \\"whoops, whoops,\\" or the barn yard term \\"bull shit\\", mimicking the act of kicking off barnyard muck.[9] The practice continues to this day.

The tour starts and returns on the U.S. side of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Maid of the Mist was built at a landing near Niagara Falls on the American side of the border.[1] The boat was christened in 1846 as a border-crossing ferry;[2] its first trip was on September 18, 1846.[3] The two-stage barge-like steamer was designed primarily as a link for a proposed ferry service between New York City and Toronto. It was a 72-foot-long side-wheeler with an 18-foot beam which was powered by steam produced from a wood- and coal-fired boiler. It could carry up to 100 passengers.[4]\\r\\nThe ferry did well until 1848, when the opening of a suspension bridge between the United States and Canada cut into the ferry traffic.

In 2007, the series was included in Time magazine's list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all-time.[4] In 2013, TV Guide ranked it at #39 on its list of the \\"60 Best Series of All Time\\".[5]\\r\\nOn April 18, 2018, CBS renewed the series for a 37th and 38th season.[6] The 37th season, Survivor: David vs. Goliath, will premiere in fall 2018.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first U.S. season of Survivor followed the same general format as the Swedish series. Sixteen or more players, split between two or more \\"tribes\\", are taken to a remote isolated location (usually in a tropical climate) and are forced to live off the land with meager supplies for 39 days (42 in The Australian Outback). Frequent physical and mental challenges are used to pit the teams against each other for rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \\"immunity\\", forcing the other tribe to attend \\"Tribal Council\\", where they must vote off one of their tribemates.\\r\\nSignaling the halfway point in the game, survivors from both tribes come together to live as one, making it to the 'merge'. At this point, survivor will compete against each other to win Individual Immunity; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out at Tribal Council. Most players that are voted out after the merge - form the game's \\"jury\\". Once the group gets down to three people, a final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury members. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \\"Sole Survivor\\" and win the show's grand prize. In all seasons for the United States version, this has included a $1 million prize in addition to the Sole Survivor title; some seasons (particularly earlier seasons) have included additional prizes, such as a car.\\r\\nThe U.S. version has introduced numerous modifications, or \\"twists\\", on the core rules in order to keep the players on their toes and to prevent players from relying on strategies that succeeded in prior seasons. These changes have included tribal switches, seasons starting with more than two tribes, the ability to exile a player from a tribe for a short time, hidden immunity idols that players can use to save themselves or others at Tribal Council, special voting powers which can be used to influence the result at Tribal Council, chance to return to regular gameplay after elimination through the \\"Redemption Island\\" or \\"The Outcast Tribe\\" twists, and a final four fire-making challenge as of season 35.\\r\\nThe United States version is produced by Mark Burnett and hosted by Jeff Probst. Each competition is called a season, has a unique name, and lasts from 13 to 16 episodes. The first season was broadcast as a summer replacement show in 2000. Starting with Survivor: Africa, there have been two seasons aired during each U.S. television season.\\r\\nIn the first season, there was a 75-person crew. By season 22, the crew had grown to 325 people.[8]\\r\\nA total of 536 contestants have competed on Survivor's 36 seasons.\\r\\nThe original idea of Survivor was developed by Charlie Parsons in 1994 under the name Castaway. Parsons formed Planet24 with Bob Geldof to produce the show and tried to have the BBC broadcast it, but the network turned it down. Parsons went to Swedish television and was able to find a broadcaster, ultimately producing Expedition Robinson in 1997. The show was a success, and plans for international versions were made.[22]\\r\\nMark Burnett intended to be the person to bring the show to the United States, though he recognized that the Swedish version was a bit crude and mean-spirited. Burnett retooled the concept to use better production values, based on his prior Eco-Challenge show, and wanted to focus more on the human drama experienced while under pressure. Burnett spent about a year trying to find a broadcaster that would take the show, retooling the concept based on feedback. On November 24, 1999, Burnett made his pitch to Les Moonves of CBS, and Moonves agreed to pick up the show.[22] The first season, Survivor: Borneo was filmed during March and April 2000, and was first broadcast on May 31, 2000. The first season became a ratings success, leading to its current ongoing run.[22]\\r\\nThe American version of Survivor has been shot in many locations around the world since the first season, usually favoring warm and tropical climates. Though locations varied across the globe in the first dozen seasons, more recent seasons have used the same general location for back-to-back filming of two cycles (for example, the use of Samoa for filming of seasons 19, 20). Since the 33rd season, the show has filmed in Fiji.\\r\\nSince The Australian Outback, the announcement of each season's winner and subsequent reunion have been broadcast live in front of a studio audience, usually alternating between the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City (home to the CBS' Late Show franchise) and CBS Television City or the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles.\\r\\nSurvivor has consistently been one of the top 20 most watched shows through its first 18 seasons and from seasons 21 to 23.[23]\\r\\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of the United States version of Survivor on CBS.\\r\\nNote: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\\r\\n^1 The season premieres of Survivor: The Australian Outback and Survivor: All-Stars each aired after a Super Bowl.\\r\\n^2 Starting with the 2013ÿ14 TV series ranking, the two seasons aired in that time are listed together as Survivor. Previously, seasons were listed separately.\\r\\n^3 The season finales of Survivor: Marquesas, and Survivor: The Amazon through Survivor: Blood vs. Water, were aired on Sunday at 8:00 pm. Additionally, when Survivor regularly aired on Thursdays, some episodes were moved to Wednesday at 8:00 pm to accommodate broadcasts of the first two weeks of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship.\\r\\nAt the end of each U.S. Survivor season from Survivor: Africa onward, various Survivor props and memorabilia are auctioned online for charity. The most common recipient has been the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.[127] Most recently, proceeds have gone toward The Serpentine Project, a charity founded by Jeff Probst, dedicated to helping those transitioning out of foster care upon emancipation at 18 years of age.[128] Items up for auction have included flags, mats, tree mails, contestant torches, contestant clothing, autographed items, immunity idols and the voting urn.[129]\\r\\nThe success of Survivor spawned a wide range of merchandise from the very first season. While early items available were limited to buffs, water bottles, hats, T-shirts, and other typical souvenir items, the marketability of the franchise has grown tremendously. Today, fans can find innumerable items, including computer and board games, interactive online games, mugs, tribal-themed jewelry, beach towels, dog tags, magnets, multi-function tools, DVD seasons, Survivor party kits, insider books, soundtracks, and more.\\r\\nSeasons 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 were released in stores. The remaining seasons have been released exclusively on Amazon.com through their CreateSpace manufacture on demand program. Select seasons have also been released on Blu-ray.\\r\\nAll seasons are available on CBS All Access, the network's over-the-top subscription streaming service.\\r\\nIn the 2001 Survivor video game for PC, developed by Infogrames, it allows players to play and create characters for the game based on the Borneo or Australian Outback cast members. The game also includes a character creation system for making custom characters.\\r\\nGameplay consists of choosing survivors' skills (fishing, cooking, etc.), forming alliances, developing relationships with other tribe members, and voting off competitors at tribal council.\\r\\nThe game was very poorly received by critics. GameSpot gave the game a 'Terrible' score of 2.0 out of 10, saying \\"If you're harboring even a tiny urge to buy this game, please listen very carefully to this advice: Don't do it.\\"[147] Likewise, IGN gave the game a 'Painful' 2.4 out of 10, stating \\"It is horribly boring and repetitive. The graphics are weak and even the greatest Survivor fan would break the CD in two after playing it for 20 minutes.\\"[148] The game was the recipient of Game Revolution's lowest score of all time, an F-.[149] An 'interactive review' was created specially for the game, and features interactive comments like \\"The Survival periods are about as much fun as\\" followed by a drop-down menu, \\"watching paint dry/throbbing hemorrhoids/staring at air/being buried alive.\\"[149]\\r\\nOn November 4, 2009, it was announced that a second video game adaptation would be released for the Wii and Nintendo DS. The game would require players to participate in various challenges like those in the reality shows in order to win.[150]\\r\\nVarious soundtracks have been released featuring music composed by Russ Landau, including soundtracks for seasons 9 through 27 (with the exception of season 14).[151]\\r\\nThe Tiki Twirl thrill ride at California's Great America in Santa Clara, California was originally called Survivor: The Ride. The ride includes a rotating platform that moves along an undulating track. Riders can be sprayed by water guns hidden in oversized tribal masks. Theme elements included drums and other familiar Survivor musical accents playing in the background, Survivor memorabilia throughout the queue and other merchandise for sale in nearby gift shops.[152]","input":"When did the first season of survivor air?"},{"output":"Founded on June 24, 1797","context":"Mission San Juan Bautista is a Spanish mission in San Juan Bautista, San Benito County, California. Founded on June 24, 1797 by Fermn Lasun of the Franciscan order, the mission was the fifteenth of the Spanish missions established in present-day California. Named for Saint John the Baptist, the mission is the namesake of the city of San Juan Bautista.\\r\\nBarracks for the soldiers, a nunnery, the Jose Castro House, and other buildings were constructed around a large grassy plaza in front of the church and can be seen today in their original form. The Ohlone, the original residents of the valley, were brought to live at the mission and baptized, followed by Yokuts from the Central Valley. Mission San Juan Bautista has served mass daily since 1797, and today functions as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing its creation in 1797, San Juan's population grew quickly. By 1803, there were 1,036 Native Americans living at the mission. Ranching and farming activity had moved apace, with 1,036 cattle, 4,600 sheep, 22 swine, 540 horses and 8 mules counted that year. At the same time, the harvest of wheat, barley and corn was estimated at 2,018 fanegas, each of about 220 pounds.\\r\\nFather Pedro Estvan Tpis (who had a special talent for music) joined Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta, at Mission San Juan Bautista in 1815 to teach singing to the Indians. He employed a system of notation developed in Spain that uses varied colors or textures for polyphonic music, usually (from bottom to top) solid black, solid red, black outline (sometimes solid yellow) and red outline (or black outline when yellow was used). His choir of Native American boys performed for many visitors, earning the San Juan Bautista Mission the nickname \\"the Mission of Music.\\" Two of his handwritten choir books are preserved at the San Juan Bautista Museum. When Father Tapis died in 1825 he was buried on the mission grounds. The town of San Juan Bautista, which grew up around the mission, expanded rapidly during the California Gold Rush and continues to be a thriving community today.\\r\\nThe mission is situated adjacent to the San Andreas Fault, and has suffered damage from numerous earthquakes, such as those of 1800 and 1906. However, the mission was never entirely destroyed at once. It was restored initially in 1884, and then again in 1949 with funding from the Hearst Foundation. The three-bell campanario, or \\"bell wall,\\" located by the church entrance, was fully restored in 2010. An unpaved stretch of the original El Camino Real, just east of the mission, lies on a fault scarp.[9]\\r\\nAlthough initially secularized in 1835, the church was reconsecrated by the Roman Catholic Church in 1859, and continues to serve as a parish of the Diocese of Monterey. The mission includes a cemetery, with the remains of over 4,000 Native American converts and Europeans buried there.\\r\\nThe mission and its grounds were featured prominently in the 1958 Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo. Associate producer Herbert Coleman's daughter Judy Lanini suggested the mission to Hitchcock as a filming location. A steeple, added sometime after the mission's original construction and secularization, had been demolished following a fire, so Hitchcock added a bell tower using scale models, matte paintings, and trick photography at the Paramount studio in Los Angeles. The tower does not resemble the original steeple. The tower's staircase was assembled inside a studio.","input":"When was the san juan bautista mission built?"},{"output":"Jon Jones","context":"UFC 182: Jones vs. Cormier was a mixed martial arts event held on January 3, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event was headlined by a Light Heavyweight Championship bout between the champion at that time, Jon Jones, and top contender Daniel Cormier.[4]\\r\\nJones was initially scheduled to face Alexander Gustafsson in a rematch on September 27, 2014 at UFC 178.[5] However, Gustafsson pulled out of the bout due to a knee injury and was replaced by Daniel Cormier.[6] Subsequently on August 12, Jones pulled out of the bout against Cormier citing a leg injury, which in turn led to the rescheduling of the pairing to this event.[4]\\r\\nA matchup for the Women's Bantamweight Championship between the champion at the time Ronda Rousey and top contender Cat Zingano was briefly attached to this event.

The most prominent event was Expo 67 in Montreal, the most successful World's Fair ever held up to that time, and one of the first events to win international acclaim for the country. The year saw the nation's Governor General, Georges Vanier, die in office; and two prominent federal leaders, Official Opposition Leader John Diefenbaker, and Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson announced their resignations. The year's top news-story was French President Charles de Gaulle's \\"Vive le Qubec libre\\" speech in Montreal. The year also saw major changes in youth culture with the \\"hippies\\" in Toronto's Yorkville area becoming front-page news over their lifestyle choices and battles with Toronto City Council. A new honours system was announced, the Order of Canada. In sports, the Toronto Maple Leafs won their 13th and last Stanley Cup.\\r\\nIn mountaineering, the year saw the first ascents of the highest peak in the remote Arctic Cordillera\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nation began to feel far more nationalistic than before, with a generation raised in a country fully detached from Britain. The new Canadian flag served as a symbol and a catalyst for this. In Quebec, the Quiet Revolution was overthrowing the oligarchy of francophone clergy and anglophone businessmen, and French Canadian pride and nationalism were becoming a national political force.\\r\\nThe Canadian economy was at its post-war peak, and levels of prosperity and quality of life were at all-time highs. Many of the most important elements of Canada's welfare state were coming on line, such as Medicare and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).\\r\\nThese events were coupled with the coming of age of the baby boom and the regeneration of music, literature, and art that the 1960s brought around the world. The baby boomers, who have since dominated Canada's culture, tend to view the period as Canada's halcyon days.\\r\\nWhile to Montreal it was the year of Expo, to Toronto it was the culmination of the Toronto Maple Leafs dynasty of the 1960s, with the team winning its fourth Stanley Cup in six years by defeating its arch-rival, the Montreal Canadiens, in the last all-Canadian Stanley Cup Final until 1986.\\r\\nAuthor and historian Pierre Berton famously referred to 1967 as Canada's last good year. In his analysis, the years following saw much of 1967's hopefulness disappear. In the early 1970s, the oil shock and other factors hammered the Canadian economy. Quebec separatism led to divisive debates and an economic decline of Montreal and Front de libration du Qubec (FLQ) terrorism. The Vietnam War and Watergate Scandal in the United States also had profound effects on Canadians.

The FSMA has given the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new authorities to regulate the way foods are grown, harvested and processed. The law grants the FDA a number of new powers, including mandatory recall authority, which the agency has sought for many years. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake more than a dozen rulemakings and issue at least 10 guidance documents, as well as a host of reports, plans, strategies, standards, notices, and other tasks.\\r\\nThe law was prompted after many reported incidents of foodborne illnesses during the first decade of the 2000s and was largely crafted by members of the Grocery Manufacturers Association. Tainted food has cost the food industry billions of dollars in recalls, lost sales and legal expenses.\\r\\nThis bill is similar to the Food Safety Enhancement Act which passed the House in 2009. It is considered the first major piece of federal legislation addressing food safety since 1938.[1] It is also the first piece of legislation to address intentional adulteration and Food Defense.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated in 2011 that each year 48 million people (1 in 6 Americans) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.[3][4] 31 pathogens are notorious for causing foodborne illness.[3] Unspecified agents have insufficient data to estimate with certainty the agent-specific burden. Known agents that have not been identified as causing foodborne illness include microbes, chemicals, or other substance known to be in food. The ability for these known agents to cause illness has not been proven so they remain unidentified. Considering the fact that, about 30% of the population is at risk for food borne sicknesses, over 14% of food supply to the United States is imported from other countries, and also new and more food items are becoming more complex or intricate, the FSMA was indeed needed. [5] The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enables FDA to better protect public health by strengthening the food safety system. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than relying primarily on reacting to problems after they occur.[4]\\r\\n(90% credible interval)\\r\\n(90% credible interval)\\r\\n(90% credible interval)\\r\\n(6.6ÿ12.7 million)\\r\\n(39,534ÿ75,741)\\r\\n(712ÿ2,268)\\r\\n(19.8ÿ61.2 million)\\r\\n(9,924ÿ157,340)\\r\\n(369ÿ3,338)\\r\\n(28.7ÿ71.1 million)\\r\\n(62,529ÿ215,562)\\r\\n(1,492ÿ4,983)\\r\\nIn 1998, the FDA announced a publication entitled \\"Guidance for Industry: Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables\\" in response to President Clinton's 1997 \\"Initiative to Ensure the Safety of Imported and Domestic Fruits and Vegetables\\".[6] They resulted in Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Handling Practices (GHP) certifications that became de facto industry requirements, but were not enforceable.[7]\\r\\nOver the past few years, high-profile outbreaks related to various foods, from spinach and peanut products to eggs, have underscored the need to make continuous improvements in food safety.[8] Under this law the FDA will be allowed to mandate a system that is based on science and addresses the hazards from farm to table. This means that the FDA has the power to oversee how foods are produced and how they are maintained in food markets. This puts greater emphasis on preventing food-borne illness. The reasoning is simple: The better the system handles producing, processing, transporting, and preparing foods, the safer our food supply will be.[8]\\r\\nUnder the new law, the FDA will now have new prevention-focused tools and a clear regulatory framework to help make substantial improvements in their approach to food safety.[4] For example, for the first time, the FDA has a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, preventive-based controls across the food supply chain. Preventive controls include steps that a food facility would take to prevent or significantly minimize the likelihood of problems occurring. The new law also significantly enhances the FDAs ability to achieve greater oversight of the millions of food products coming into the United States from other countries each year.\\r\\nThe events of Sep 11, 2001 reinforced the need to enhance the security of the United States. Congress responded by passing the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act, 'the Bioterrorism Act', which President Bush signed into law June 12, 2002.[9] The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 granted the FDA administrative detention authority over food items if there is credible evidence or information that indicates the food presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.[10] The new (FSMA) law broadens that authority, allowing for administrative detention based on reason to believe that the food item has been misbranded or adulterated and thus violates a legal standard for the product.[10]\\r\\nThe first version of the law, the Food Safety Enhancement Act, passed the House on June 9, 2009. However, negotiations with the Senate led to the final product, the 'Food Safety and Modernization Act.' The bill was passed by the Senate in November 2010 by a vote of 73ÿ25.[11] However, because of a tax provision added to the bill, (which is constitutionally required to begin in the House), the vote did not count. There was concern that with the short time left in the lame-duck session, the bill would not get the time needed to be voted on and passed.[12] Attempts to add the bill to the continuing resolution for government funding were scrapped over the objection of Senator Tom Coburn.[13] Eventually, however, the Senate moved on December 19, 2010 to pass the fixed bill by unanimous consent by a voice vote.[12] The House went on to approve the bill by a vote of 215 to 144 on December 21, 2010.[14][15] President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on Tuesday, January 4, 2011.[16]\\r\\nAlthough this bill is meant to address food safety, there are, according to food safety advocate Bill Marler, some issues with its effectiveness. Many facilities, such as farms, restaurants, and nonprofit food establishments in which food is prepared for or served directly to the consumer are exempt from the requirements of the bill. Also exempt are facilities that produce food solely for non-human animals.[17]\\r\\nSenators Jon Tester and Kay Hagan sponsored two amendments that removed farmers, ranchers and local processors from federal oversight, leaving themas they currently arewithin the existing regulatory framework of state and local health and sanitation laws and rules.[18]\\r\\nThe amendment will offer protections for operations (a.k.a. qualified facilities) that sell less than $500,000 a year and sell most (greater than 50%) of their products directly to consumers in the same state and within a 400-mile radius.[19] The amendment also applies to all operations that the FDA classified as a \\"very small business.\\" Small, local farmers would not necessarily need to comply with some of the requirements and produce safety regulations implemented under S. 510.[19] Instead, these small-scale producers (like those who sell their goods at farmers' markets or roadside stands) would continue to be regulated by local and state entities. In addition, consumers would know whom they are buying from either by direct sales or clear labeling.[19]\\r\\nFarmers who qualify must provide documentation that the farm is in compliance with state regulations. Documentation may include licenses, inspection reports, or other evidence that the farm is in compliance with State, local, county, or other applicable non-Federal food safety law.[20] The farm must also prominently and conspicuously display the name and address of farm/facility on its label. For foods without a label then by poster, sign, or placard, at the point of purchase or, in the case of Internet sales, in an electronic notice, or in the case of sales to stores and restaurants, on the invoice.[20]\\r\\nThe legislation affects every aspect of the U.S. food system, from farmers to manufacturers to importers.[21] It places significant responsibilities on farmers and food processors to prevent contaminationa departure from the country's reactive tradition, which has relied on government inspectors to catch tainted food after the fact[21] The legislation requires food producers and importers to pay an annual $500 registration fee, which would help fund stepped-up FDA inspections, enforcement and related activities such as food-safety research[21] About 360,000 facilities in the United States and abroad would be subject to the fees. The Congressional Budget Office reported that the fees would not cover the cost of the new system, leaving the FDA to incur a net cost of $2.2 billion over five years.[21]\\r\\nFor the first time, the FDA will have a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply, including pet food and animal feed.\\r\\nThe FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them. FSMA provides the FDA with new authority to conduct inspections and ensure compliance.\\r\\nThe bill gives the FDA the authority to recall food in the case of contamination or illness. In addition, it requires farms to track their food and implement plans to deal with recalls or outbreaks of disease. FDA officials will also be given access to food growers records in the case of an outbreak. The bill also requires food importers to verify that they meet US food safety standards.[26] Small farms that sell locally or sell less than $500,000 a year are exempt from these new rules.[27] New authorities include:\\r\\nThe FSMA gives the FDA authority to better ensure that imported products meet U.S. standards and are safe for U.S. consumers, with the vision that imported foods should be held to the same standards as domestic foods. These standards will be met by implementing the following components:\\r\\nThe FSMA builds a formal system of collaboration with other government agencies, both domestic and foreign. In doing so, the statute explicitly recognizes that all food safety agencies need to work together in an integrated way to achieve our public health goals. The following are examples of enhanced collaboration:\\r\\nThe FSMA also includes provisions that protect employees who try to prevent food safety problems. Section 402 of the FSMA prohibits employers engaged in the manufacture, processing, packing, transporting, distribution, reception, holding or importation of food from retaliating against employees who disclose violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This particular portion of the FSMA is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor.[28]\\r\\nNow that the Act is in place, the FDA must begin the rulemaking process to codify how they intend to enforce the new laws.[10]\\r\\nEffective June 12, 2011, many food companies will be required to develop food safety plans based on an evaluation of hazards related to food manufactured, processed, packed or held in all registered facilities.[29] Following a hazard analysis, firms must identify and implement preventive controls to significantly minimize or prevent the occurrence of such hazards. Examples of preventive controls include sanitation procedures for food contact surfaces; employee hygiene training; environmental monitoring to verify pathogen controls; a recall plan; supplier verification activities; and a food allergen control program.[29]\\r\\nEven after the rulemaking process is complete, it will likely be some time before the FDA is fully equipped to enforce the new laws. The agency estimates that it will need at least 1,000 more inspectors and $1.4 billion over the next five years, and it is certainly not a sure thing that Congress will appropriate such funds given the current economic climate and calls for spending cuts and smaller government.[10]\\r\\nThe first public comment period occurred in 2013, and the agency received tens of thousands of comments in that period.[30] The FDA previously submitted their proposed regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review, and in that process the OMB weakened the regulations in a variety of ways.[31]\\r\\nIn 2012, the FDA was sued by consumer groups the Center for Food Safety (CFS) and the Center for Environmental Health for its failure to meet deadlines.[32] In settling the litigation, the agency agreed to deadlines in 2015 and 2016 for certain rules.[32]\\r\\nNow, the FDA has planned to make available to the general public and to Congress significant progress they have made towards implementing the FSMA.[33] In March 2012, the FDAs Senior Advisor, Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network, Sherri McGarry, on a blog reported the types of foods to be used in the pilot project on tracing products to prevent illnesses.[34] The list includes tomatoes, frozen Kung Pao-style dishes, jarred peanut butter, and dry, packaged peanut/spice.[34] Tomatoes both sliced and whole was chosen because of the significant number of outbreaks recorded; it mirrors a multifaceted food supply chain and it was recognized by majority of the food industry associations as the number one food product to be used in the pilot program.[34]\\r\\nThe Frozen Kung Pao-style dishes have ingredients such as chicken, red pepper spice and peanut products which are foods that are involved in outbreaks, for this reason they are in the pilot project.[34] In addition, it is supplied to diverse food chain distribution channels which could be involved in imported and domestic products.[34] To increase the intricacy of the pilot project, the jarred peanut butter and dry, packaged spice peanut were included.[34] This summer, the pilot projects results will be accomplished with hopes of developing a complete product tracing system with the information received.[34]\\r\\nThe Safety Act was signed into law along with the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010. The cost for the first five years is projected to be $1.4 billion and is not yet fully funded.[35]\\r\\nSince October 22, 2012, the updated food facility registration system by the US FDA is available. This update requires all facilities previously registered prior to October 1, 2012 to renew registration. Failure to do so is a prohibited act and will lead to refusal of entry for foreign products and illegal trade for domestic facilities.[36] Every 2 years in even numbered years, every registered facility needs to renew its registration between October 1 and December 31. Registration is accepted by fax, mail and electronics means on the FDA food facility registration website.\\r\\nAs of January 22, 2014 there were 195,518 food facilities registered with the FDA.[37]\\r\\nLarge trade organizations have joined public health advocates in supporting the bill, while groups aligned with individuals and small farms have generally opposed it.[38] However, after Senate adoption of Jon Tester's amendment, which allows for the possible exemption of producers that sell less than $500,000 a year,[39] many large food companies objected, arguing that the exemption puts consumers at risk.[40]\\r\\nA year after enactment the agency has fallen behind on expected progress. It has yet to implement \\"a specific timetable for issuing\\" a process to create rule for science-based produce standards, has not completed rules for foreign supplier verification, and must still create a guidance that will help schools and childcare programs lessen allergy risks for school-age children.[41]\\r\\nA similar set of New Zealand rules, the Food Bill 160-2, is moving towards passage since 2010. The primary effects expected are to tie New Zealand to Codex Alimentarius and the World Trade Organization permanently, although those international agreements will be constantly adjusted. Despite its 366 pages, Food Bill 160-2 cannot directly resolve many threats to food safety, as there is no added Produce traceability nor methods to control Antibiotic resistance. Controversy has been intense in NZ regarding introduction of genetic engineered plants and animals (GE); concern is that WTO and Codex will require opening up NZ to GE. The Soil & Health Association of New Zealand would not be able to complete their campaign towards making New Zealand organic by 2020.\\r\\nThere has been criticism that the FDA's proposed rule[42] would be prohibitively expensive on the practice of alcoholic beverage facilities selling spent grain to farmers for animal food.[43] Under current law, alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, cider and spirits, are exempt from the FDA's normal oversight of food products.[44] The FDA will open up the rule to comments again this summer[when?] and then revise the proposal, which is due to be finalized by August 2015.[43]\\r\\nThe proposed rules regulate the \\"good manufacturing practice in manufacturing, processing, packing or holding of animal food\\" and \\"require that certain facilities establish and implement hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls for food for animals\\", but animal food at alcoholic beverage facilities would not be exempt pursuant to section 116 of FSMA[45] since \\"those spent grains are not alcoholic beverages themselves, and they are not in a prepackaged form that prevents any direct human contact with the food\\".[46]","input":"When was the food safety modernization act passed?"},{"output":"Greg Oden","context":"The 2007 NBA draft was held on June 28, 2007 at the WaMu Theatre at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York.

The Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: ??ϫ Olympia[1][2][3][4][5][6] \\"the Olympics\\"; also ??? Olympias[7][4][5][6] \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC.[8] They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in AD?393 as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.\\r\\nDuring the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate,[9] although there were victorious women chariot owners. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek city-state and kingdom were allowed to participate, although the Hellanodikai, the officials in charge, allowed king Alexander I of Macedon to participate in the games only after he had proven his Greek ancestry.[10][11] The games were always held at Olympia rather than moving between different locations as is the practice with the modern Olympic Games.[12] Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Greeks, it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology.[13] During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.[14] These origin traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games.[15]\\r\\nThe earliest myths regarding the origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, Pausanias. According to the story, the dactyl Heracles (not to be confused with the son of Zeus and the Roman god Hercules) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath (which thus became a peace symbol), which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively).[16][17] The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus) would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.[18]\\r\\nAnother myth of the origin of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who had a beautiful daughter named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time, the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.\\r\\nOne other myth, this one occurring after the aforementioned myth, is attributed to Pindar. He claims the festival at Olympia involved Heracles, the son of Zeus. The story goes that after completing his labors, Heracles established an athletic festival to honor his father.\\r\\nThe games of previous millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleisthenes of Pisa at the behest of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle.[19] The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.[20]\\r\\nSince these myths were documented by historians like Pausanias, who lived during the reign of Marcus Aurelius in the AD?160, it is likely that these stories are more fable than fact. It was often supposed that the origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to funeral games of the Mycenean period and later.[21] Alternatively, the games were thought to derive from some kind of vegetation magic or from initiation ceremonies. The most recent theory traces the origins of the games to large game hunting and related animal ceremonialism.[22]\\r\\nThe Olympic games were held to be one of the two central rituals in ancient Greece, the other being the much older religious festival, the Eleusinian Mysteries.[23]\\r\\nThe games started in Olympia, Greece, in a sanctuary site for the Greek deities near the towns of Elis and Pisa (both in Elis on the peninsula of Peloponnesos). The first games began as an annual foot race of young women in competition for the position of the priestess for the goddess, Hera,[24] and a second race was instituted for a consort for the priestess who would participate in the religious traditions at the temple.[25]\\r\\nThe Heraean Games, the first recorded competition for women in the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's Description of Greece, c.?AD?175, state that Hippodameia gathered a group known as the \\"Sixteen Women\\" and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to Pelops. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the \\"Sixteen Women\\" were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in Classical Greek mythology, Zeus was the father of the deities in the pantheon of that era. The Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia housed a 13-metre-high (43?ft) statue in ivory and gold of Zeus that had been sculpted by Phidias circa 445?BC. This statue was one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants.\\r\\nThe historian Ephorus, who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated.[26][27][28] The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term Olympiad for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316?BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765?BC for the first year of the first Olympiad.[29] Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.[30]\\r\\nThe only competition held then was, according to the later Greek traveller Pausanias who wrote in AD?175, the stadion race, a race over about 190 metres (620 feet), measured after the feet of Hercules. The word stadium is derived from this foot race.\\r\\nThe Greek tradition of athletic nudity (gymnos)[31] was introduced in 720?BC, either by the Spartans or by the Megarian Orsippus, and this was adopted early in the Olympics as well.\\r\\nSeveral groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668?BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.\\r\\nThe Olympic Games were part of the Panhellenic Games, four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The Olympic Games were more important and more prestigious than the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games.\\r\\nThe games were in decline for many years but continued past AD?385, by which time flooding and earthquakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia.[32] In 394 Theodosius I banned all pagan festivals, but archeological evidence indicates that some games were still held.[33]\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus, and on the middle day of the games, 100 oxen would be sacrificed to him.[12] Over time Olympia, the site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek pantheon and a temple, built by the Greek architect Libon, was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest Doric temples in Greece.[12] The sculptor Pheidias created a statue of the god made of gold and ivory. It stood 42 feet (13?m) tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.[12] As the historian Strabo put it,\\r\\n... the glory of the temple persisted?... on account both of the festal assembly and of the Olympian Games, in which the prize was a crown and which were regarded as sacred, the greatest games in the world. The temple was adorned by its numerous offerings, which were dedicated there from all parts of Greece.[12]\\r\\nArtistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets, painters and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Sculptors created works like Myron's Diskobolos or Discus Thrower. Their aim was to highlight natural human movement and the shape of muscles and the body. Poets would be commissioned to write poems in praise of the Olympic victors. Such victory songs or epinicians, were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose.[34] Pierre de Coubertin, one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games.[35] His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in Athens in 1896.[36]\\r\\nPower in ancient Greece became centered around the city-state in the 8th?century BC.[37] The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity.[38] These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction.[39] The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: On one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources.[40] The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.[41]\\r\\nIn the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to the mountain competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' rolls.[42] The spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that Cyrene was founded c. 630?BC by settlers from Thera with Spartan support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, Hellenic culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted.[43]\\r\\nThe games faced a serious challenge during the Peloponnesian War, which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenic city-state.[44] The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.[12][45]\\r\\nDuring the Olympic Games, a truce, or ekecheiria was observed. Three runners, known as spondophoroi were sent from Elis to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce.[46] During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia and legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed.[46] Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.[45][47]\\r\\nWhile a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world.[48] As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, Pausanias, a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades,\\r\\nSotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this act he was banished by the Cretans.[12]\\r\\nApparently starting with just a single foot race, the program gradually increased to twenty-three contests, although no more than twenty featured at any one Olympiad.[49] Participation in most events was limited to male athletes except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the equestrian events. Youth events are recorded as starting in 632 BC. Our knowledge of how the events were performed primarily derives from the paintings of athletes found on many vases, particularly those of the Archaic and Classical periods.[50]\\r\\nThe only event recorded at the first thirteen games was the stade, a straight-line sprint of just over 192 metres.[51] The diaulos (lit. \\"double pipe\\"), or two-stade race, is recorded as being introduced at the 14th Olympiad in 724 BC. It is thought that competitors ran in lanes marked out with lime or gypsum for the length of a stade then turned around separate posts (kampteres), before returning to the start line.[52] Xenophanes wrote that \\"Victory by speed of foot is honored above all.\\"\\r\\nA third foot race, the dolichos (\\"long race\\"), was introduced in the next Olympiad. Accounts of the race's distance differ, it seems to have been from twenty to twenty-four laps of the track, around 7.5?km to 9?km, although it may have been lengths rather than laps and thus half as far.[53][54]\\r\\nThe last running event added to the Olympic program was the hoplitodromos, or \\"Hoplite race\\", introduced in 520 BC and traditionally run as the last race of the games. Competitors ran either a single or double diaulos (approximately 400 or 800 metres) in full military armour.[55] The hoplitodromos was based on a war tactic of soldiers running in full armor to surprise the enemy.\\r\\nWrestling (pale) is recorded as being introduced at the 18th Olympiad. Three throws were necessary for a win. A throw was counted if the body, hip, back or shoulder (and possibly knee) touched the ground. If both competitors fell nothing was counted. Unlike its modern counterpart Greco-Roman wrestling, it is likely that tripping was allowed.[56]\\r\\nBoxing (pygmachia) was first listed in 688 BC,[57] the boys event sixty years later. The laws of boxing were ascribed to the first Olympic champion Onomastus of Smyrna.[58] It appears body-blows were either not permitted or not practised.[59][60] The Spartans, who claimed to have invented boxing, quickly abandoned it and did not take part in boxing competitions.[58] At first the boxers wore himantes (sing. himas), long leather strips which were wrapped around their hands.[57]\\r\\nThe pankration was introduced in the 33rd Olympiad (648 BC).[61] Boys' pankration became an Olympic event in 200 BC, in the 145th Olympiad.[62] As well as techniques from boxing and wrestling, athletes used kicks,[63] locks, and chokes on the ground. Although the only prohibitions were against biting and gouging, the pankration was regarded as less dangerous than boxing.[64]\\r\\nIt was one of the most popular events: Pindar wrote eight odes praising victors of the pankration.[65] A famous event in the sport was the posthumous victory of Arrhichion of Phigaleia who \\"expired at the very moment when his opponent acknowledged himself beaten.\\"[66][67]\\r\\nThe pentathlon was a competition made up of five events: running, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw and wrestling.[68] The pentathlon is said to have first appeared at the 18th Olympiad in 708 BC.[69] The competition was held on a single day,[70] but it is not known how the victor was decided,[71][72] or in what order the events occurred,[73] except that it finished with the wrestling.[74]\\r\\nHorse racing and chariot racing were the most prestigious competitions in the games, due to only the wealthy being able to afford the maintenance and transportation of horses. These races consisted of different events: the four-horse chariot race, the two-horse chariot race, and the horse with rider race, the rider being hand picked by the owner. The four-horse chariot race was the first equestrian event to feature in the Olympics, being introduced in 680 BC. It consisted of two horses that were harnessed under a Yoke in the middle, and two outer horses that were attached with a rope.[75] The two-horse chariot was introduced in 408 BC.[76] The horse with rider competition on the other hand, was introduced in 648 BC. In this race, Greeks didn't use saddles or stirrups, so they required good grip and balance.[77]\\r\\nIn AD?67, the Roman Emperor Nero competed in the chariot race at Olympia. He was thrown from his chariot and was thus unable to finish the race. Nevertheless, he was declared the winner on the basis that he would have won if he had finished the race.[78]\\r\\nAthletic festivals under the name of \\"Olympic games\\", named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at Antioch, obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of Pisa.[87]","input":"When were the first ancient olympic games held?"},{"output":"August 5, 1994","context":"The Little Rascals is a 1994 American family comedy film produced by Amblin Entertainment, and released by Universal Pictures on August 5, 1994. The film is an adaptation of Hal Roach's Our Gang, a series of short films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as The Little Rascals) which centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood children. The film, with a screenplay by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur, and Penelope Spheeris?ÿ who also directed?ÿ presents several of the Our Gang characters in an updated setting, and features re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It was the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were Liar Liar and Heartbreakers.\\r\\nA sequel, The Little Rascals Save the Day, was released as a direct-to-video feature in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanky McFarland (Travis Tedford) is the president of the \\"He-Man Woman Haters Club\\" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa Switzer (Bug Hall), Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, \\"The Blur\\", in the upcoming Soap Box Derby go-kart race. Unfortunately, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.\\r\\nThe boys go to find Alfalfa and they discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl and that is against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the Clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans.\\r\\nAt the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date (whoopee cushion, cat litter in sandwiches, etc.). When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which causes her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down.\\r\\nDarla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions toward Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing), the new kid in town whose father (Donald Trump) is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, one of the members, Stymie (Kevin Jamal Woods), assigns him to guard the go-kart until the day of the race.\\r\\nAlfalfa makes several attempts to woo back Darla, including sending her a fake love note. When that attempt fails, Spanky goes with him to formally break things off with Darla. They are initially turned from the door of her ballet school, but Spanky insists that they will wait for Darla to come out; Spanky gives Alfalfa a frog to play with while they wait. They are soon spotted by the neighborhood bullies Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins), who chase them inside the building. To get away, the boys duck into a costume room and disguise themselves in ballet drag. They manage to evade the bullies, but when they attempt to enter another room to get out of their disguises, they are surprised to find the room filled with girls, including Darla, dressed in ballet outfits. The boys nervously pretend to be in the ballet recital that is about to take place, but Alfalfa almost gives them away when the frog he is still holding croaks. Just as they are about to back out of the room, the ballet mistress (Lea Thompson) enters and ushers them all on stage.\\r\\nSpanky and Alfalfa awkwardly try to dance along but Alfalfa immediately begins squirming in discomfort, for the frog was in his tights. The recital quickly falls into chaos, and Alfalfa and Spanky run off of the stage and dispose of the frog.\\r\\nThe ballet mistress, furious that they ruined her recital, confronts them and throws them out immediately, Alfalfa in his underwear and Spanky still in drag. Butch and Woim are waiting for them outside the door, so Spanky distracts them while Alfalfa sneaks out. When Spanky loses his wig, the bullies give chase. Spanky manages to lose them, but they bump into Alfalfa, who is trying to run home in his underwear. They chase him into a mansion but are turned away by the butler. Alfalfa gets through and escapes out the back door, but is chased by a Doberman and he leaps into a pool and swims to the other side, but just as he climbs out of the pool, his underwear slips right off. As Alfalfa retrieves them, he discovers Darla and Waldo in a hot tub, laughing at him, to his embarrassment. The doberman then chases Alfalfa off the property.\\r\\nAt the carnival talent show the day before the race, Alfalfa once again tries to win Darla back, this time through song, being that Darla mentioned after she dumped him that the only thing she ever really missed about him was his voice. Waldo and Darla also entered the show in a duet. Alfalfa then requests the chance to perform for her and win her back. However, Waldo sabotages his attempts to serenade her by putting soap in his drinking water, causing him to burp out bubbles all throughout his song.\\r\\nThe boys try to fund-raise $450, the cost of the lumber needed to rebuild their clubhouse. The youngest club members, Buckwheat (Ross Elliot Bagley) and Porky (Zachary Mabry), have unwittingly come up with $500, not realizing that their method for earning the money was not exactly honest. Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree (Daryl Hannah), finds out about the scheme and confronts them, but Spanky convinces her to donate the money to be given as first prize in the go-kart derby.\\r\\nAs a result of Alfalfa's carelessness, \\"The Blur\\" is eventually stolen by Butch and Woim, so that now, in addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys need a new go-kart. They band together to build \\"Blur 2: The Sequel,\\" and prior to race day, Spanky and Alfalfa (who previously had a falling out when the latter discovers the gang's \\"prank list\\") reconcile their friendship and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, which is to be presented to the winners by A.J. Ferguson.\\r\\nButch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo and Darla are also in the go-kart race, but they're eventually annoyed with each other, and Waldo seemingly kicks Darla out from his car midway through the race. In a wild dash to the finish, and despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the race, \\"The Blur 2\\" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack in a photo-finish between \\"The Blur\\" and \\"The Blur 2\\" literally by a hair, due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle. After the race, Butch and Woim are angry towards Alfalfa because he won the trophy and the prize money. They attempt to beat him up, but Alfalfa finally stands up for himself and punches Butch in the face, knocking him into a pool of pig slop. Woim then gets scared and jumps into the slop willingly.\\r\\nAlong with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla, after it is revealed that it had been Darla who had kicked Waldo out of their car and finished the race alone because she found out that Waldo was responsible for the bubbles at the talent show. Spanky, meanwhile, is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson, who turns out to be female (Reba McEntire). Spanky confesses to Darla that he and the boys pulled the pranks on her at their picnic lunch, not Alfalfa. After the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart towards membership and they decide to welcome Darla as well as other girls into the club, adding a \\"Women Welcome\\" sign onto the front door.\\r\\nAnimals\\r\\nBill Thomas, Jr., son of the late Bill Thomas, who played the original Buckwheat, contacted the studio and was invited down to visit the set, but got the impression that the filmmakers did not want him or any of the surviving original cast members involved in any production capacity. The surviving cast members saw this as especially hurtful, in light of the fact that director Penelope Spheeris had previously made a point of including Buddy Ebsen, from the original Beverly Hillbillies, in her 1993 feature film adaptation of that series. Eugene Jackson, who played the original Pineapple from the silent Our Gang comedies, and tried unsuccessfully to contact the studio to be a part of production, stated, \\"It's real cold.

Set in a version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic talking animals, the plot revolves around a bumbling panda named Po who aspires to be a kung fu master. When an evil kung fu warrior named Tai Lung is foretold to escape after twenty years in prison, Po is unwittingly named the chosen one destined to defeat him and bring peace to the land, much to the chagrin of the resident kung fu warriors.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for the film was conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animation executive. The film was originally intended to be a parody, but director Stevenson decided instead, to shoot an action comedy wuxia film that incorporates the hero's journey narrative archetype for the lead character. The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. As with most DreamWorks animated films, Hans Zimmer (collaborating with John Powell this time) scored Kung Fu Panda. He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the China National Symphony Orchestra as part of his preparation. A sequel, Kung Fu Panda 2, was released on May 26, 2011, along with a television series, Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness later that same year as a part of a franchise. A second sequel called Kung Fu Panda 3 was released on January 29, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nKung Fu Panda premiered in the United States on June 6, 2008. The film received positive reviews upon release. Kung Fu Panda opened in 4,114 theaters, grossing $20.3?million on its opening day and $60.2?million on its opening weekend, resulting in the number one position at the box office. The film became DreamWorks' biggest opening for a non-sequel film, the highest grossing animated film of the year worldwide, and also had the fourth-largest opening weekend for a DreamWorks animated film at the American and Canadian box office, behind Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and Shrek Forever After.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Valley of Peace, a land in ancient China inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Po, a giant panda, is a Kung Fu fanatic who idolizes the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper, and Crane), a quintet of Kung Fu students trained by the red panda Master Shifu at the Jade Palace. However, as he helps his adoptive goose father Mr. Ping in his noodle restaurant, Po is unable to pursue his dream of becoming a Kung Fu master himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Master Oogway, a sage old tortoise and Shifu's mentor, has a vision that Shifu's former student, the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison and return to the Valley of Peace to exact his revenge. Panicked, Shifu sends his messenger, Zeng the goose, with a request for the prison to tighten the security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway can identify the Dragon Warrior, the one Kung Fu master worthy of the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to the boundless power and be capable of defeating Tai Lung. Po fails to arrive at the arena before the doors are closed. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky and crashes into the arena. He opens his eyes to see Oogway pointing his finger at him. Much to the shock of everyone there (including Po), Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnwilling to accept Oogway's decision, Shifu tries to dispose of Po with an excruciatingly harsh training regime bordering on torture coupled with constant belittlement of his physique and personality. Following in Shifu's footsteps, the Furious Five similarly berate and mock Po as simply an enthusiast with no potential in the martial art. Po considers resigning, but after receiving encouragement from Oogway, he endures his training and slowly begins to befriend the Five with his culinary skill, resilience, and good humor, though Tigress remains reluctant to accept him as the Dragon Warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nTigress tells Po the story of Shifu and Tai Lung. Long ago, Shifu found the infant Tai Lung on the steps of the palace. He brought up Tai Lung as his son and taught him Kung Fu. Although Tai Lung was a proficient Kung Fu practitioner, Oogway refused to give him the Dragon Scroll. Tai Lung attacked the valley and tried to take the scroll by force, but Oogway successfully stopped him. Shifu, filled with guilt and sorrow over his son's betrayal, became cold and distant to his later students. Meanwhile, Tai Lung escapes from prison as foreseen by Oogway, ironically picking his locks with one of Zeng's fallen feathers. Shifu learns of Tai Lung's escape from Zeng and informs Oogway, who extracts a promise from Shifu to believe in Po, and then passes on to the heavens in a stream of peach blossoms. Still unable to grasp the basics of Kung Fu, Po despairingly admits that he has no chance of defeating Tai Lung. However, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food, and takes advantage of this in order to successfully train Po by incorporating these feats into an effective Kung Fu style.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Furious Five set out to stop Tai Lung themselves, only to be defeated by his nerve strikes. Following their return, Shifu decides that Po is ready to receive the Dragon Scroll, but the scroll reveals nothing but a blank reflective surface. Unable to understand the message of the scroll, Shifu orders Po and the Five to evacuate the valley while he faces Tai Lung, knowing that he will most likely forfeit his life. As Tai Lung arrives and fights Shifu, a distraught Po finds Mr. Ping. In an attempt to console his son, Mr. Ping reveals that the secret ingredient to his famous \\"secret ingredient soup\\" is \\"nothing\\" (explaining that \\"to make something special, you just have to believe it is\\"). Po realizes that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll and goes back to confront Tai Lung.\\r\\n\\r\\nPo becomes a formidable challenge for Tai Lung, frustrating him with confusing fighting techniques on top of a physique that renders him immune to Tai Lung's nerve strikes. Tai Lung momentarily bests Po and retrieves the scroll, but he is unable to understand it. When Po explains to Tai Lung that the true secret to becoming the Dragon Warrior is to just believe in yourself, he refuses to accept it and continues attacking Po. Eventually, Po defeats Tai Lung in combat before using the mysterious Wuxi Finger Hold to vanquish him. Po is praised by the Valley of Peace and earns the respect of the Furious Five, who fully acknowledge him as a true Kung Fu master. Po then finds Shifu, who finally attains inner peace, now that the valley is safe once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nco-director John Stevenson on the comedic approach to the martial arts film.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublicized work on the film began in October 2004.[5] In September 2005, DreamWorks Animation announced the film alongside Jack Black, who was selected to be the main voice star.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2005, DreamWorks Animation announced that Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu and Ian McShane would join Jack Black in the cast.[7] This is also the second DreamWorks Animation film in which Black and Angelina Jolie have co-starred together, the first being 2004's Shark Tale.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for the film was conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animation executive.[9] Initially, the idea was to make it a spoof, but co-director John Stevenson was not particularly keen on it and instead chose the direction of a character-based  wuxia comedy.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nReportedly inspired by Stephen Chow's 2004 martial arts action comedy, Kung Fu Hustle,[10] the co-directors wanted to make sure the film also had an authentic Chinese and kung fu feel to it.  Production designer Raymond Zibach and art director Tang Heng spent years researching Chinese painting, sculpture, architecture and kung fu films to help create the look of the film.[11] Zibach said some of the biggest influences for him are the more artful martial arts films such as Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.[11] Stevenson's aim for the film, which took four years to make, was to make \\"the best looking film DreamWorks has ever made\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nDan Wagner, Head of Character Animation.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hand-drawn animation sequence at the beginning of the film was made to resemble Chinese shadow puppetry.[13] The opening, which was directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson and produced by James Baxter, was praised by The New York Times reviewer Manohla Dargis as \\"striking\\" and \\"visually different from most mainstream American animations\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther reviewers have compared the opening to the evocative style of Genndy Tartakovsky's Samurai Jack.[15][16] The rest of the film is modern computer animation, which uses bright, offbeat colors to evoke the natural landscape of China.[13] The end credit sequence also features hand-drawn characters and still paintings in the background.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe computer animation used throughout the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. When the head of production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen, she reportedly laughed and wished him \\"good luck\\". \\"When we started talking,\\" said Manninen, \\"the movie was still a high concept. But for everyone that looked at it, it screamed complexity. We launched off saying, how can you make this movie tangible? How can you find smart ways to bring this world to life in a way that makes it a great movie and not feel like the complexity becomes the driver of the story, but the story and the emotion being the driver?\\"[17] In preparation, the animators took a six-hour kung fu class.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nProducer Melissa Cobb said that originally Po was \\"more of a jerk,\\" but that the character changed after they heard Jack Black.[18] According to Jack Black, he mostly worked \\"in isolation\\", although he and Dustin Hoffman did spend a day together, which Cobb said helped with the scene where their characters face off.[18] Lucy Liu said that the film \\"was quite different because it was such a long process.\\"[19] Liu said that when she was presented with the project they already had artwork of her character as well as a \\"short computerized video version of what she would look like when she moved.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film held its worldwide premiere at the 61st Cannes Film Festival on May 15, 2008,[20] where it received massive and sustained applause at the end of the film's screening.[21] Kung Fu Panda later had national premieres in the US on June 1, 2008 at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California,[22] and on June 26, 2008 at Leicester Square in London, for the UK.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nKung Fu Panda was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 9, 2008,[24] and on 3D Blu-ray on December 6, 2011 as a Best Buy exclusive.[25] The DVD double pack release of Kung Fu Panda also includes a short animated film Secrets of the Furious Five.[24] With 7,486,642 DVD units sold in 2008, Kung Fu Panda was the fourth highest-selling film and the first highest-selling animated film of 2008, right before WALL-E, which sold 7,413,548 units.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nRotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of 183 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Kung Fu Panda has a familiar message, but the pleasing mix of humor, swift martial arts action, and colorful animation makes for winning summer entertainment.\\"[27] Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 33 reviews.[28] Audience gave the film an average A- grade on CinemaScore.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Corliss of Time Magazine gave Kung Fu Panda a positive review, stating the picture \\"provides a master course in cunning visual art and ultra-satisfying entertainment\\".[29] The New York Times said, \\"At once fuzzy-wuzzy and industrial strength, the tacky-sounding Kung Fu Panda is high concept with a heart,\\" and the review called the film \\"consistently diverting\\" and \\"visually arresting\\".[14] Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com commented, \\"Blazing across the screen with eye-popping, sublime artwork, Kung Fu Panda sets itself apart from the modern domestic animation trend with its sheer beauty [...] the film enters instant classic status as some of the most gorgeous animation Hollywood has produced since the golden age of Disney.\\"[30] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called the film \\"one of the few comedies of 2008 in any style or genre that knows what it's doing\\".[31] However, Tom Charity of CNN criticized the action for tending \\"to blur into a whirlwind of slapstick chaos\\" and considered the character of Po too similar to others played by Black.[32] Peter Howell of The Toronto Star awarded the film two and a half stars, considering it to have a \\"lack of story\\" that \\"frequently manages to amuse, if not entirely to delight\\".[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film topped the box office in its opening weekend, grossing $60.2 million for a $14,642 average from 4,114 theaters[34] and performing much better than analysts had been expecting.[35] It also was the highest-grossing opening for a non-sequel DreamWorks Animation film at the time.[35] In its second weekend, the film retreated 44% to second place behind The Incredible Hulk grossing $33.6 million for a $8,127 average from expanding to 4,136 theaters.[36] It closed on October 9, 2008 after 125 days of release, grossing $215.4 million in the United States and Canada and $416.3 million overseas for a worldwide total of $631.7 million.[37] Kung Fu Panda was the highest-grossing non-Shrek film from DreamWorks Animation in the United States and Canada, before being surpassed by How to Train Your Dragon in 2010.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nKung Fu Panda was also well received in China.[39] It made nearly 110?million Yuan by July 2, 2008, becoming the first animated film to earn more than 100?million Yuan in China.[40][41]  The Chinese director Lu Chuan commented, \\"From a production standpoint, the movie is nearly perfect. Its American creators showed a very sincere attitude about Chinese culture.\\"[42][43] The film's critical and commercial success in China led to some local introspection about why no film like Kung Fu Panda had been produced in China, with commentators attributing the problem variously to lower film budgets in China, too much government oversight, a dearth of national imagination, and an overly reverent attitude to China's history and cultural icons.[44][45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nKung Fu Panda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature[47] and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film,[48] but both awards were won by Pixar's WALL-E. Jack Black joked about his film's underdog status at the 81st Academy Awards, saying \\"Each year, I do one DreamWorks project, then I take all the money to the Oscars and bet it on Pixar.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, Kung Fu Panda won 10 Annie Awards (including Best Picture) out of 16 nominations, although this created controversy, with some accusing DreamWorks head Jeffrey Katzenberg of rigging the vote by buying ASIFA-Hollywood memberships (with voting power) for everyone at DreamWorks Animation.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with most DreamWorks animated movies, composer Hans Zimmer scored Kung Fu Panda. Zimmer visited China to absorb the culture and got to know the Chinese National Symphony as part of his preparation; in addition, Timbaland also contributed to the soundtrack.[66] The soundtrack also includes a partially rewritten version of the classic song, \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\", performed by Cee-Lo Green and Jack Black for the end credits. Furthermore, in some versions, the ending credit was sung by Rain. Although Zimmer was originally announced as the main composer of the film, during a test screening, CEO of DreamWorks Animation SKG Jeffrey Katzenberg announced that composer John Powell would also be contributing to the score. This marked the first collaboration in eight years for the two, who had previously worked together on DreamWorks' The Road to El Dorado and the action thriller Chill Factor. A soundtrack album was released by Interscope Records on June 3, 2008.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nA sequel, Kung Fu Panda 2, was released on Thursday, May 26, 2011,[68] to good reviews (Rotten Tomatoes rating of 81%). It was released in 3-D and was directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (who directed the 2-D opening sequence of the first film) with the original cast returning. The story features a new villain with a mysterious weapon so powerful it threatens the existence of kung fu, and Po must additionally confront his past.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second sequel, Kung Fu Panda 3 was announced as a co-production between DreamWorks Animation and Shanghai-based Oriental DreamWorks.[69] Kung Fu Panda 3 was released on January 29, 2016.[70] DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has said that perhaps the series could see 3 more sequels after Kung Fu Panda 3, bringing it to a six-film series.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nA manga based on the film was released in Japan in Kerokero Ace magazine's September 2008 issue.[72] It is written by Hanten Okuma and illustrated by Takafumi Adachi.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nA television series titled Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness aired on Nickelodeon with its premiere on September 19, 2011.[74] From the cast of Kung Fu Panda, only Lucy Liu and James Hong reprised their roles, of Master Viper and Mr. Ping respectively.[75] In the series, Po continues to defend the Valley of Peace from all kinds of villains, while making mistakes, learning about the history of kung fu, and meeting other kung fu masters. In the United States, the series ended its run on June 29, 2016, with a total of three seasons and 80 episodes. However, prior to premiering in the U.S., the final few episodes first premiered in Germany from December 30, 2014 to January 7, 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kung Fu Panda Holiday Special was aired on NBC Wednesday, November 24, 2010.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nA video game adaptation of the film was published by Activision on June 3, 2008.[77] The game was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS and PC platforms. The plot follows the same basic plot as the film, but with Tai Lung portrayed as the leader of various gangs that surround the Valley of Peace, which Po, who possesses some basic martial art skills which can be upgraded as the game progresses, must defeat. The game was released on Microsoft Windows, as well as multiple consoles. However the Windows version has been discontinued. The game received mostly positive reviews; it scored a Metacritic rating of 76% from critics[78] and a 7.5 out of 10 from IGN.[79] In 2009, it won the International Animated Film Society's Annie Award for Best Animated Video Game, \\"in recognition of creative excellence in the art of animation.\\"[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nDreamWorks Animation was sued in 2011 by a writer, Terence Dunn, for allegedly stealing the idea for Kung Fu Panda from him.[81] Dunn alleged that DreamWorks Animation had stolen his pitch for a \\"spiritual kung-fu fighting panda bear\\" which he sent to a DreamWorks executive in 2001.[81] DreamWorks Animation denied any wrongdoing and after a two-week trial the jurors found in favor of DreamWorks.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, another lawsuit was brought against the studio by an illustrator named Jayme Gordon.

Meanwhile, the American colonists and the British government began to fight over whether Parliament in London or the colonial assemblies had primary responsibility for taxation. As part of that conflict, the colonists organized the Boston Tea Party in response to a tax on tea. The British government responded by passing the Intolerable Acts, which included the closing of Boston Harbor and the revocation of Massachusetts's colonial charter.[1] This conflict exacerbated tensions further. The ideological conflict escalated into open warfare in 1775, at which point the American patriots revolted against British rule. France, who had been rebuilding her Navy and other forces, saw this as an opportunity to seriously weaken her perennial enemy.

Estimates place the percentage of French supplied arms to the Americans in the Saratoga campaign at up to 90%.[3] By 1777, over five million livres of aid had been sent to the American rebels.\\r\\nMotivated by the prospect of glory in battle or animated by the sincere ideals of liberty and republicanism, volunteers like Pierre Charles L'Enfant joined the American army. The most famous was Lafayette, a charming young aristocrat who defied the king's order and enlisted in 1777 at age 20. He became an aide to George Washington and a combat general. More importantly, he solidified a favorable American view of France. Kramer argues that Lafayette provided a legitimacy for the war and confidence that there was serious European support for independence. Lafayette's personal style was highly attractive; the young man learned quickly, adapted to the Patriot style, avoided politics, and became a fast friend of General Washington. Fifty years later, after a major career in French politics, he returned as a beloved hero of the war.[4]\\r\\nUp against the British power, the young nation lacked arms and allies, and so it turned towards France. France was not directly interested in the conflict, but saw it as an opportunity to contest British power by supporting a new British opponent. Through negotiations conducted first by Silas Deane and then by Benjamin Franklin, France began covert support of the American cause.\\r\\nSecretly approached by Louis XVI and France's foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes, Pierre Beaumarchais was authorized to sell gunpowder and ammunition to the Americans for close to a million pounds under the veil of the French company Rodrigue Hortalez et Compagnie. The aid given by France, much of which passed through the neutral Dutch West Indies port of Sint Eustatius, contributed to George Washington's survival against the British onslaught in 1776 and 1777. The aid was also a major factor in the defeat of General Burgoyne's expedition in the Champlain corridor that ended in a British disaster at Saratoga. French ports accommodated American ships, including privateers and Continental Navy warships, that acted against British merchant ships. France provided significant economic aid, either as donations or loans, and also offered technical assistance, granting some of its military strategists \\"vacations\\" so they could assist American troops.\\r\\nSilas Deane, appointed by the Americans and helped by French animosity towards Britain, obtained unofficial aid, starting in early 1776. However, the goal was the total involvement of France in the war. A new delegation composed of Franklin, Deane, and Arthur Lee, was appointed to lobby for the involvement of European nations. Franklin, age 70 and already well known in French intellectual circles for his scientific discoveries, served as the chief diplomat with the title of \\"minister\\" (the term \\"ambassador\\" was not used). He dressed in rough frontier clothes rather than formal court dress, and met with many leading diplomats, aristocrats, intellectuals, scientists and financiers. Franklin's image and writings caught the French imagination ÿ there were many images of him sold on the market ÿ and he became the image of the archetypal new American and a hero for aspirations for a new order inside France. When the international climate at the end of 1777 had become tenser, Habsburg Austria requested the support of France in the War of the Bavarian Succession against the Prussia in line with the Franco-Austrian Alliance. France refused, causing the relationship with Austria to turn sour. Under these conditions, asking Austria to assist France in a war against the British was impossible. Attempts to rally Spain also failed: Spain did not immediately recognize potential gains, and the American revolutionary spirit was seen as threatening the legitimacy of the Spanish Crown in its own American colonies.\\r\\nPublic opinion in France was in favor of open war, but King Louis and his advisors were reluctant due to the possible risks and heavy expenses involved. The king's economic and military advisors, in particular, remained reluctant. The French Navy was being rapidly rebuilt, but there were doubts as to how ready it was for serious conflict. Financiers Turgot and Necker warned war would be very expensive for France's wobbly system of taxation and finance.\\r\\nThe Americans argued that an alliance of the United States, France, and Spain would assure a rapid defeat of the British, but Vergennes, waiting until his navy was ready, hesitated. On July 23, 1777, Vergennes decided that it was time to decide either total assistance, with war, or abandonment of the new nation. The choice, ratified by the king, was war.[5]\\r\\nThe British had taken Philadelphia in 1777, but American victory at the Battle of Saratoga brought back hope to the Patriots and enthusiasm in France. The army of Burgoyne surrendered to American forces after Saratoga and France realized that the United States could be victorious. The king directed Vergennes to negotiate an alliance with the Americans.[6]\\r\\nFrance formally recognized the United States on February 6, 1778, with the signing of the Treaty of Alliance. Hostilities soon followed after Britain declared war on France on March 17, 1778. The British naval force, then the largest fleet afloat, and French fleet confronted each other from the beginning. The British avoided intercepting a French fleet that left Toulon under the comte d'Estaing in April for North America, fearing the French fleet at Brest might then be used to launch an invasion of Britain. France had kept the Brest fleet to protect commercial shipping in European waters, and it sailed out only after a British fleet was confirmed to have left in pursuit of d'Estaing, thus weakening the British Channel fleet. In spite of this reduction, the British fleet still outnumbered the French fleet at Brest, and Admiral d'Orvilliers was instructed to avoid combat when he sailed in July. D'Orvilliers met the fleet of Admiral Augustus Keppel in the indecisive Battle of Ushant on July 27, after which both fleets returned to port for repairs.\\r\\nFrance did consider the landing of 40,000 men in the nearby British Isles but abandoned the idea because of logistical issues. On the continent, France was protected through its alliance with Austria which, even if it did not take part in the American Revolutionary War, affirmed its diplomatic support of France.\\r\\nOther nations in Europe at first refused to openly join the war but both Spain and the Dutch Republic gave unofficial support to the American cause. Vergennes was able to convince the Spanish to formally enter the war in 1779 and, in 1780, Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic over claims of Dutch violations of neutrality.\\r\\nFrench participation in North America was initially maritime in nature and marked by some indecision on the part of its military leaders. In 1778, American and French planners organized an attempt to capture Newport, Rhode Island, then under British occupation. The attempt failed, in part because Admiral d'Estaing did not land French troops prior to sailing out of Narragansett Bay to meet the British fleet. He then sailed to Boston after his fleet was damaged in a storm. In 1779, d'Estaing again led his fleet to North America for joint operations, this time against British-held Savannah, Georgia. About 3,000 French joined with 2,000 Americans in the Siege of Savannah, in which a naval bombardment was unsuccessful. An attempted assault of the entrenched British position was repulsed with heavy losses.\\r\\nSupport became more notable when, in 1780, 6,000 soldiers led by Rochambeau landed at Newport, itself abandoned in 1779 by the British, and then established a naval base there. These forces were largely inactive since the fleet was closely watched by the British fleet from its bases in New York and eastern Long Island. By early 1781, with the war dragging on, French military planners were finally convinced that more significant operations would be required in North America to bring a decisive end to the war. That year's West Indies fleet was commanded by the comte de Grasse, and specific arrangements were made to coordinate operations with him. De Grasse asked to be supplied with North American pilots and to be informed of possible operations in North America to which he might contribute. Rochambeau and Washington met in Wethersfield, Connecticut in May 1781 to discuss their options. Washington wanted to drive the British from both New York City and Virginia (the latter led first by Benedict Arnold, then by Brigadier William Phillips and eventually by Charles Cornwallis). Virginia was also seen as a potent threat that could be fought with naval assistance. These two options were dispatched to the Caribbean along with the requested pilots. Rochambeau, in a separate letter, urged de Grasse to come to the Chesapeake Bay for operations in Virginia. Following the Wethersfield conference, Rochambeau moved his army to White Plains, New York and placed his command under Washington.\\r\\nDe Grasse received these letters in July at roughly the same time Cornwallis was preparing to occupy Yorktown, Virginia. De Grasse concurred with Rochambeau and subsequently sent a dispatch indicating that he would reach the Chesapeake at the end of August but that agreements with the Spanish meant he could only stay until mid-October. The arrival of his dispatches prompted the Franco-American army to begin a march for Virginia. De Grasse reached the Chesapeake as planned and his troops were sent to assist Lafayette's army in the blockade of Cornwallis's army. A British fleet sent to confront de Grasse's control of the Chesapeake was defeated by the French on September 5 at the Battle of the Chesapeake and the Newport fleet delivered the French siege train to complete the allied military arrival. The Siege of Yorktown and following surrender by Cornwallis on October 19 were decisive in ending major hostilities in North America.[7]\\r\\nOther important battles between the French and the British were spaced out around the world, from the West Indies to India. France's navy at first dominated in the West Indies, capturing Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent, Montserrat, Tobago, and St. Kitts, but losing St. Lucia at the beginning of the war. A planned Franco-Spanish invasion of Jamaica was aborted after the decisive Battle of the Saintes in 1782. At the end of the war. the French captured the Turks and Caicos Islands. In European waters, France and Spain joined forces with the entry of Spain into the war in 1779. An attempted invasion of Britain failed due to a variety of factors. French and Spanish forces besieged Gibraltar from 1779 to 1783, but were unsuccessful in either storming the site, or preventing repeated British relief of its garrison. They were more successful in capturing Minorca in Europe and Demerara and Essequibo in South America in February 1782.\\r\\nIn India, British troops gained control of French outposts in 1778 and 1779, sparking the Kingdom of Mysore, a longtime French ally, to begin the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Allied with the French, the Mysoreans for a time threatened British positions on the east coast, but that war ended status quo ante bellum in 1784. A French fleet commanded by the Bailli de Suffren fought a series of largely inconclusive battles with a British fleet under Sir Edward Hughes, and the only major military land action, the 1783 Siege of Cuddalore, was cut short by news that a preliminary peace had been signed.\\r\\nBecause of decisive battles on American soil, the French were in a strong position during the peace negotiations in Paris.\\r\\nStarting with the Siege of Yorktown, Benjamin Franklin never informed France of the secret negotiations that took place directly between Britain and the United States. Britain acknowledged that the United States owned all the land south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River, except for Florida (which went to Spain). However, since France was not included in the American-British peace discussions, the alliance between France and the U.S. was weakened. Thus the influence of France and Spain in future negotiations was limited.[8]\\r\\nThe war formally ended in September 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. France gained (or regained) territories in the Americas, Africa, and India. Losses in the 1763 Treaty of Paris and in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) were in part regained: Tobago, Saint Lucia, the Senegal River area, as well as increased fishing rights in Terra Nova. Spain regained Florida and Minorca, but Gibraltar remained in the hands of the British.\\r\\nBecause the French involvement in the war was distant and naval in nature, over a billion livres tournois were spent by the French government to support the war effort, raising its overall debt to about 3.315 billion. The finances of the French state were in disastrous shape and were made worse by Jacques Necker, who, rather than increase taxes, used loans to pay off debts. State secretary of Finances Charles Alexandre de Calonne attempted to fix the deficit problem by asking for the taxation of the property of nobles and clergy but was dismissed and exiled for his ideas. The French instability further weakened the reforms that were essential in the re-establishment of stable French finances. Trade also severely declined during the war, but was revived by 1783.\\r\\nThe war was especially important for the prestige and pride of France, who was reinstated in the role of European arbiter. However, Great Britain, not France, became the leading trading partner of the United States.[9] The French took pride in their cultural influence on the young country through the Enlightenment, as attested by Franklin and Jefferson, and as embodied in the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the United States Constitution in 1787. In turn, the Revolution influenced France.[10] Liberal elites were satisfied by the victory but there were also some major consequences. European conservative Royalists and nobility had become nervous, and began to take measures in order to secure their positions. On May 22, 1781, the Decree of Sgur closed the military post offices of the upper rank to the common persons, reserving those ranks exclusively for the nobility.\\r\\nIn all the French spent 1.3 billion livres to support the Americans directly, in addition to the money it spent fighting Britain on land and sea outside the U.S.[11][12][13]\\r\\nFrance's status as a great modern power was re-affirmed by the war, but it was detrimental to the country's finances. Even though France's European territories were not affected, victory in a war against Great Britain with battles like the decisive siege of Yorktown in 1781 had a large financial cost which severely degraded fragile finances and increased the national debt. France gained little except that it weakened its main strategic enemy and gained a new, fast-growing ally that could become a welcome trading partner. However, the trade never materialized, and in 1793 the United States proclaimed its neutrality in the war between Great Britain and the French Republic.[14]\\r\\nSome historians argue that France primarily sought revenge against Great Britain for the loss of territory in North America and India from the previous conflict. But Jonathan R. Dull states that France intervened because of dispassionate calculation, not because of Anglophobia or a desire to avenge the loss of Canada.[15]","input":"What was france's role in the american revolution?"},{"output":"50,000","context":"This article lists the United States of America's military dead, wounded, and missing person totals for wars and major deployments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Deaths per day\\" is the total number of Americans killed in military service, divided by the number of days between the dates of the commencement and end of hostilities. \\"Deaths per population\\" is the total number of deaths in military service, divided by the U.S. population of the year indicated.\\r\\na. ^ Revolutionary War: All figures from the Revolutionary War are rounded estimates.

Two-thirds of the 7.4-acre (30,000?m2) site is landscaping and water. Each pillar is inscribed with the name of one of the 48 U.S. states of 1945, as well as the District of Columbia, the Alaska Territory and Territory of Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Their inclusion in the memorial acknowledges the significance of the symbol to American soldiers during World War II and how it represented their presence and protection wherever it was inscribed.[7]\\r\\nOn approaching the semicircle from the east, a visitor walks along one of two walls (right side wall and left side wall) picturing scenes of the war experience in bas relief. As one approaches on the left (toward the Pacific arch), the scenes begin with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams, taking the oath, and being issued military gear. The reliefs progress through several iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a homecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a similar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European theatre. Some scenes take place in England, depicting the preparations for air and sea assaults. The last scene is of a handshake between the American and Russian armies when the western and eastern fronts met in Germany.\\r\\nThe Freedom Wall is on the west side of the memorial, with a view of the Reflecting Pool and Lincoln Memorial behind it. The wall has 4,048 gold stars, each representing 100 Americans who died in the war. In front of the wall lies the message \\"Here we mark the price of freedom\\".[8]\\r\\nIn 1987, World War II veteran Roger Durbin approached Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio, to ask if a World War II memorial could be constructed. Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the House of Representatives as HR 3742 on December 10. The resolution authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) to establish a World War II memorial in \\"Washington, D.C., or its environs\\", but the bill was not voted on before the end of the session, so it was not passed. Two more times, in 1989 and 1991, Rep. Kaptur introduced similar legislation, but these bills suffered the same fate as the first, and did not become law.\\r\\nKaptur reintroduced legislation in the House a fourth time as HR 682 on January 27, 1993, one day after Senator Strom Thurmond (a Republican from South Carolina) introduced companion Senate legislation. On March 17, 1993, the Senate approved the act, and the House approved an amended version of the bill on May 4. On May 12, the Senate also approved the amended bill, and the World War II Memorial Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on May 25 of that year, becoming Public Law 103-32.\\r\\nOn September 30, 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed a 12-member Memorial Advisory Board (MAB) to advise the ABMC in picking the site, designing the memorial, and raising money to build it. A direct mail fundraising effort brought in millions of dollars from individual Americans. Additional large donations were made by veterans' groups, including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge and others. The majority of the corporate fundraising effort was led by two co-chairs: Senator Bob Dole, a decorated World War II veteran and 1996 Republican nominee for president; and Frederick W. Smith, the president and chief executive officer of FedEx Corporation and a former U.S. Marine Corps officer. The U.S. federal government provided about $16 million. A total of $197 million was raised.\\r\\nOn January 20, 1995, Colonel Kevin C. Kelley, project manager for the ABMC, organized the first meeting of the ABMC and the MAB, at which the project was discussed and initial plans made. The meeting was chaired by Commissioner F. Haydn Williams, chairman of ABMC's World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee, who would go on to guide the project through the site selection and approval process and the selection and approval of the Memorial's design. Representatives from the United States Commission of Fine Arts, the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Capital Memorial Commission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Park Service attended the meeting. Selection of an appropriate site was taken on as the first action.\\r\\nOver the next months, several sites were considered. Three quickly gained favor:[9][10]\\r\\nOther sites considered but quickly rejected were:\\r\\nThe selection of the Rainbow Pool site was announced on October 5, 1995. The design would incorporate the Rainbow Pool fountain, located across 17th Street from the Washington Monument and near the Constitution Gardens site.[11]\\r\\nThe location is itself a significant symbol. The memorial will be given a more prominent spot than any monument on the National Mall since the Lincoln Memorial opened in 1922. The location, between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, represents the first addition in more than 70 years to the grand corridor of open space that stretches from the Capitol 2.1 miles west to the Potomac River.[12]\\r\\nA nationwide design competition drew 400 submissions from architects from around the country. Friedrich St. Florian's initial design was selected in 1997. Over the next four years, St. Florian's design was altered during the review and approval process required of proposed memorials in Washington, D.C. Ambassador Haydn Williams guided the design development for ABMC.\\r\\nSt. Florian's design consists of an architectural sculpture that evokes a classical monument. The two memorial arches, Pacific and Atlantic baldacchinos each have laurel wreaths suspended in the air with 4 eagles carrying it. The chandelier sculpture symbolizes the victory of the War with the Nation's bird carrying a Grecian symbol of victory but with an American adaptation of oak laurel wreaths to symbolize strength.\\r\\nEach of the 56 pillars all consists of oak laurel wreaths and wheat laurel wreath. The oak symbolizes military and industrial strength and the wheat symbolizes agricultural and breadbasket during the U.S. part in the war.\\r\\nGround was broken in September 2001. The construction was managed by the General Services Administration.\\r\\nThe triumphal arches were crafted by Rock of Ages Corporation. Sculptor Raymond Kaskey created the bronze eagles and wreaths that were installed under the arches, as well as 24 bronze bas-relief panels that depict wartime scenes of combat and the home front.[13] The bronzes were cast over the course of two and a half years at Laran Bronze in Chester, Pennsylvania.[14] The stainless-steel armature that holds up the eagles and wreaths was designed at Laran, in part by sculptor James Peniston,[15] and fabricated by Apex Piping of Newport, Delaware.[16]\\r\\nThe John Stevens Shop designed the lettering for the memorial and most of the inscriptions were hand-carved in situ.\\r\\nThe memorial opened to the public on April 29, 2004, and was dedicated in a May 29 ceremony attended by thousands of people. The memorial became a national park on November 1, when authority over it was transferred to the National Park Service.\\r\\nIn 2012, the memorial's fountain was renovated.[17]\\r\\nCritics such as the National Coalition to Save Our Mall opposed the location of the memorial. A major criticism of the location was that it would interrupt what had been an unbroken view between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The memorial was also criticized for taking up open space that had been historically used for major demonstrations and protests.[18][19][20]\\r\\nCritics were particularly bothered by the expedited approval process, which is considerably lengthy most of the time.[21] The United States Congress, worried that World War II veterans were dying before an appropriate memorial could be built, passed legislation exempting the World War II Memorial from further site and design review. Congress also dismissed pending legal challenges to the memorial.[22]\\r\\nThere were also aesthetic objections to the design. A critic from the Boston Herald described the monument as \\"vainglorious, demanding of attention and full of trite imagery.\\"[23] The Philadelphia Inquirer argued that \\"this pompous style was also favored by Hitler and Mussolini\\"[24] (see Nazi architecture). The Washington Post described it as \\"overbearing\\", \\"bombastic\\", and a \\"hodgepodge of cliche and Soviet-style pomposity\\" with \\"the emotional impact of a slab of granite\\".[25]\\r\\nSome supporters said that the design evoked federal architecture during the New Deal period, influenced by an austere interpretation of Art Deco/Beaux Arts styles.[citation needed] This view, and the monument, were dismissed by one prominent architecture critic as \\"knee-jerk historicism\\"[26]\\r\\nOn May 23, 2013, Senator Rob Portman introduced the World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2013 (S. 1044; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Secretary of the Interior to install at the World War II memorial in the District of Columbia a suitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of D-Day.[27] The bill was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Hindu American Foundation, and the Interfaith Alliance.[28] Together the organizations argued that the bill \\"endorses the false notion that all veterans will be honored by a war memorial that includes a prayer proponents characterize as reflecting our country's 'Judeo-Christian heritage and values.'\\"[28] The organizations argued that \\"the memorial, as it currently stands, appropriately honors those who served and encompasses the entirety of the war\\" and was carefully created, so no additional elements, such as FDR's prayer, need to be added.[28] But, they said, \\"the effect of this bill, however, is to co-opt religion for political purposes, which harms the beliefs of everyone.\\"[28] The bill passed in the United States Senate on June 5, 2014.[29]\\r\\nThe southern end of the memorial, dedicated to the Pacific theater\\r\\nThe northern end of the memorial, dedicated to the Atlantic theater\\r\\n\\"The Price of Freedom\\"\\r\\nEngraving of Kilroy on the memorial\\r\\nClose up of the engraving at the memorial\\r\\nThe Pacific Arch\\r\\nA seal on the floor of the memorial using the World War II Victory Medal design\\r\\nEach of the 4,048 gold stars represents 100 Americans who died during the war\\r\\nThe Pacific Arch (Atlantic Arch in the background)\\r\\nThe Atlantic Arch\\r\\nView of the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. from the \\"Atlantic\\" arch of the memorial.\\r\\nWorld War II Memorial (2013)\\r\\nPanoramic view at night, Washington Monument in the background\\r\\nThe memorial, looking east in winter\\r\\nFive state pillars and flag\\r\\nNorth Carolina pillar\\r\\nPennsylvania pillar\\r\\nCentral Fountain with the Atlantic Arch in background\\r\\nWorld War II Memorial Fountain in Washington D.C.\\r\\nWorld War II Memorial, Fountain in the evening.\\r\\nWorld War II Memorial","input":"Who does the world war 2 memorial honor?"},{"output":"November 4, 1879","context":"Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847?ÿ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.[1] He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\",[2] he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.[3]\\r\\nEdison was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents was the widespread impact of his inventions: electric light and power utilities, sound recording, and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution[4] to homes, businesses, and factories ÿ a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, and grew up in Port Huron, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804ÿ1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810ÿ1871, born in Chenango County, New York).[5] His father, the son of a Loyalist refugee, had moved as a boy with the family from Nova Scotia, settling in southwestern Ontario (then called Upper Canada), in a village known as Shewsbury, later Vienna, by 1811. Samuel Jr. eventually fled Ontario, because he took part in the unsuccessful Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837.[6] His father, Samuel Sr., had earlier fought in the War of 1812 as captain of the First Middlesex Regiment. By contrast, Samuel Jr.'s struggle found him on the losing side, and he crossed into the United States at Sarnia-Port Huron. Once across the border, he found his way to Milan, Ohio. His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been \\"Edeson.\\"[7]\\r\\nEdison only attended school for a few months and was instead taught by his mother.[8] Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.[9]\\r\\nEdison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.[10][11]\\r\\nEdison's family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, after the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854 and business declined.[12] Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and sold vegetables. He briefly worked as a telegraph operator in 1863 for the Grand Trunk Railway at the railway station in Stratford, Ontario, at age 16. He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.[13][14]\\r\\nEdison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers.[14] This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.[15][16]\\r\\nEdison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.[17]\\r\\nIn 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimesreading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a leadÿacid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.[18]\\r\\nOne of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869.[19]\\r\\nOn December 25, 1871, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855ÿ1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:\\r\\nMary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor[23] or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.[24]\\r\\nEdison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.[25]\\r\\nOn February 24, 1886, at the age of thirty-nine, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865ÿ1947) in Akron, Ohio.[26] She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:\\r\\nMina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.[30][31]\\r\\nEdison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877.[32] This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park,\\" New Jersey.[2]\\r\\nHis first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \\"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\\".[33] In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.[34] The Washington Post described Edison as a \\"genius\\" and his presentation as \\"a scene... that will live in history\\".[35] Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,[36] he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.\\r\\nEdison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($211,700 in today's dollars.[37]), which he gratefully accepted.[38] The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.\\r\\nWilliam Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \\"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\\".[39] Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics.[40]\\r\\nNearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.[41]\\r\\nIn just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \\"a stock of almost every conceivable material\\".[42] A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained \\"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels?... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell?... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores?...\\" and the list goes on.[43]\\r\\nOver his desk, Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous quotation: \\"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\\"[44] This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.\\r\\nWith Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.[45] Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.[25]\\r\\nIn 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a \\"transmitter\\") by developing a carbon microphone that used a button of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.[46] His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention[47]) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).[46][48]\\r\\nEdison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union.[47] In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890[47] and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting.[49] He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer,[50] William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich G?bel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.[51]:217ÿ218 Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).[52]\\r\\nAfter many experiments, first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals, Edison returned to a carbon filament.[53] The first successful test was on October 22, 1879;[51]:186[54][55][25] it lasted 13.5 hours.[56] Edison continued to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \\"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\\".[57] This was the first commercially practical incandescent light.[58]\\r\\nAlthough the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \\"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\\",[57] it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200?hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.[59]\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask,[60] and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \\"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\\"[61]\\r\\nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia's new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.[62][63][64][65]\\r\\nLewis Latimer joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884. Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the \\"Process of Manufacturing Carbons\\", an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs. Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.[66]\\r\\nGeorge Westinghouse's company bought Philip Diehl's competing induction lamp patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.[67]\\r\\nOn October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years, until October 6, 1889, when a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \\"a filament of carbon of high resistance\\" was valid.[68] To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.\\r\\nMahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison's assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation.[69] In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre.[70]\\r\\nAfter devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \\"utility\\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.[71] On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.[72]\\r\\nIn January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.\\r\\nAs Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885ÿ1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \\"step down\\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.[73] Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\\r\\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \\"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\\"[74] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.[75] Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.[76]\\r\\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.[77][78] Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \\"battle of currents\\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\\r\\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.[79][80]\\r\\nEdison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm R?ntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.\\r\\nThe fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to the exposure. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \\"Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\\"[81]\\r\\nThe key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.\\r\\nEdison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or \\"Kinetograph\\". He did the electromechanical design while his employee W.?K.?L. Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.[51] In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.[83]\\r\\nIn April 1896, Thomas Armat's Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.\\r\\nOfficially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman Irving T. Bush (1869ÿ1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kintoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-?sterreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck[84] of the Schokoladen-Ssswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.\\r\\nThe first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kintoscope Fran?ais, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.[85]\\r\\nOn May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kintoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. The businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.[85]\\r\\nEdison's film studio made close to 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott's Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.\\r\\nAs the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.[86] To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.[87]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.\\r\\nEdison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. He thought that talkies had \\"spoiled everything\\" for him. \\"There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\\"[88] His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.[89]\\r\\nStarting in the late 1870s, Thomas Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.[90]\\r\\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.[91] A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.\\r\\nThe Edison Storage Battery Company was founded in 1901. With this company Edison exploited his invention of the accumulator. In 1904 already 450 people worked at the company. The first accumulators were produced for electric cars. But there were several defects. Several Customers were complaining about the products. When the capital of the company was spent Edison paid for the company with his private money. Not until 1910 Edison showed a mature product: A Nickel-Iron-Battery with Lye as liquid.\\r\\nEdison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber. He joined Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford (each contributing $25,000) to create the Edison Botanic Research Corp. in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida the following year. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.[92] After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant.\\r\\nEdison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \\"Glenmont\\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought property in Fort Myers, Florida, and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.[93]\\r\\nDue to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.[94]\\r\\nEdison's work on rubber took place largely at his botanic research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.[95] The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3ÿ4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.[96]\\r\\nHenry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs also participated.\\r\\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \\"The Civitan Club is doing thingsbig thingsfor the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\\"[97] He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\\r\\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.[98]\\r\\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit.[98]\\r\\nEdison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; \\"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\\".[51] He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \\"correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\\" She also said that during one of his periodic \\"great scientific adventures\\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.[88]\\r\\nEdison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.[citation needed]\\r\\nEdison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, \\"Glenmont\\" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. He is buried behind the home.[99][100]\\r\\nEdison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.[101] A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made.[102] Mina died in 1947.\\r\\nHistorian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \\"freethinker\\".[51] Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason.[51] Edison defended Paine's \\"scientific deism\\", saying, \\"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\\"[51] In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:\\r\\nNature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me? the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love? He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us? nature did it all? not the gods of the religions.[103]\\r\\nEdison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:\\r\\nYou have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.[51]\\r\\nHe also stated, \\"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\\"[104]\\r\\nNonviolence was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \\"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\\" Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: \\"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\\"[105][106] He was a vegetarian[107] but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life.[51]\\r\\nIn 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a \\"spirit phone\\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.[108] Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \\"I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\\"[109]\\r\\nThomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times stating \\"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\\"[110]\\r\\nIn the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.[110]\\r\\nHe thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \\"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\\".[111] In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.[112][113]\\r\\nThe President of the Third French Republic, Jules Grvy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barthlemy-Saint-Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (Lgion d'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881;[114] Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889.[115]\\r\\nIn 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\\r\\nThe Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.[115]\\r\\nIn 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.[116]\\r\\nHe was named an Honorable Consulting Engineer at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's fair in 1904.[115]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison received the American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1915, Edison was awarded Franklin Medal of The Franklin Institute for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries and the well-being of the human race.[117]\\r\\nIn 1920, the United States Navy department awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1923, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers created the Edison Medal and he was its first recipient.[115]\\r\\nIn 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences.[115]\\r\\nOn May 29, 1928, Edison received the Congressional Gold Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1983, the United States Congress, pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution 140 (Public Law 97198), designated February 11, Edison's birthday, as National Inventor's Day.[118]\\r\\nLife magazine (USA), in a special double issue in 1997, placed Edison first in the list of the \\"100 Most Important People in the Last 1000 Years\\", noting that the light bulb he promoted \\"lit up the world\\". In the 2005 television series The Greatest American, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.\\r\\nIn 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\\r\\nIn 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award.\\r\\nIn 2011, Edison was inducted into the Entrepreneur Walk of Fame and named a Great Floridian by the Florida Governor and Cabinet.[119]\\r\\nSeveral places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of Edison, New Jersey. Thomas Edison State University, nationally known for adult learners, is in Trenton, New Jersey. Two community colleges are named for him: Edison State College (now Florida SouthWestern State College) in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edison Community College in Piqua, Ohio.[120] There are numerous high schools named after Edison (see Edison High School) and other schools including Thomas A. Edison Middle School. Footballer Pel's father originally named him Edson, as a tribute to the inventor of the light bulb, but the name was incorrectly listed on his birth certificate as \\"Edison\\".[121]\\r\\nThe small town of Alva just east of Fort Myers took Edison's middle name.\\r\\nIn 1883, the City Hotel in Sunbury, Pennsylvania was the first building to be lit with Edison's three-wire system. The hotel was renamed The Hotel Edison upon Edison's return to the city on 1922.[122]\\r\\nLake Thomas A Edison in California was named after Edison to mark the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb.[123]\\r\\nEdison was on hand to turn on the lights at the Hotel Edison in New York City when it opened in 1931.[124]\\r\\nThree bridges around the United States have been named in Edison's honor: the Edison Bridge in New Jersey,[125] the Edison Bridge in Florida,[126] and the Edison Bridge in Ohio.[127]\\r\\nIn space, his name is commemorated in asteroid 742 Edisona.\\r\\nIn West Orange, New Jersey, the 13.5 acres (5.5 hectares) Glenmont estate is maintained and operated by the National Park Service as the Edison National Historic Site, as is his nearby laboratory and workshops including the reconstructed \\"Black Maria\\"the world's first movie studio.[128] The Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum is in the town of Edison, New Jersey.[129] In Beaumont, Texas, there is an Edison Museum, though Edison never visited there.[130] The Port Huron Museum, in Port Huron, Michigan, restored the original depot that Thomas Edison worked out of as a young news butcher. The depot has been named the Thomas Edison Depot Museum.[131] The town has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison's parents, and a monument along the St. Clair River. Edison's influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000.\\r\\nIn Detroit, the Edison Memorial Fountain in Grand Circus Park was created to honor his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the lightbulb.[132] On the same night, The Edison Institute was dedicated in nearby Dearborn.\\r\\nHe was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1969.\\r\\nA bronze statue of Edison was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on September 20 of that year. The Edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor William Allen that had been one of Ohio's two allowed contributions to the collection.[133]\\r\\nThe Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later IEEE, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. It is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually \\"for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts.\\"\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the Edison Award after him. The award is an annual Dutch music prize, awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry, and is one of the oldest music awards in the world, having been presented since 1960.\\r\\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers concedes the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award to individual patents since 2000.[134]\\r\\nThe United States Navy named the USS Edison (DD-439), a Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II.[135] In 1962, the Navy commissioned USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.[citation needed][136]\\r\\nThomas Edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day. Edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of Nikola Tesla.\\r\\n\\"Camping with Henry and Tom\\", a fictional play based on Edison's camping trips with Henry Ford, written by Mark St.Gemain. First presented at Lucille Lortel Theatre, New York, February 20, 1995.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn February 11, 2011, on what would have been Thomas Edison's 164th birthday, Google's homepage featured an animated Google Doodle commemorating his many inventions. When the cursor was hovered over the doodle, a series of mechanisms seemed to move, causing a lightbulb to glow.[137]\\r\\nThe following is a list of people who worked for Thomas Edison in his laboratories at Menlo Park or West Orange or at the subsidiary electrical businesses that he supervised.\\r\\nLocations\\r\\nInformation and media","input":"When did the first light bulb get invented?"},{"output":"autonomous territory","context":"","input":"Is hong kong a country or a city?"},{"output":"where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as A-levels, BTEC and the International Baccalaureate Diploma, or school-level qualifications such as GCSEs","context":"A sixth form college is an educational institution in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Belize, the Caribbean, Malta, Norway, Brunei, and Malaysia, among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as A-levels, BTEC and the International Baccalaureate Diploma, or school-level qualifications such as GCSEs. In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase \\"sixth form college\\" as the English name for a lyce.[1]\\r\\nIn England and the Caribbean, education is currenty compulsory until the end of year 13, the school year in which the pupil turns 18 (previously in England, education was compulsory only until year 11 before August 2013 and until year 12 between August 2013 and 2015).[2] In the English state educational system, pupils may either stay at a secondary school with an attached sixth form, transfer to a local sixth form college, or go to a more vocational further education college, although in some places there may in practice be little choice which of these options can be taken. In the independent sector, sixth forms are an integral part of secondary schools (public schools), and there is also a number of smaller-scale independent sixth form colleges. In Wales, education is only compulsory until the end of year 11.\\r\\nStudents at sixth form college typically study for two years (known as Years 12 and 13, Years 13 and 14 in Northern Ireland and/or lower sixth and upper sixth). Some students sit AS examinations at the end of the first year, and A-level examinations at the end of the second. These exams are called C.A.P.E. (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in the Caribbean. In addition, in recent years a variety of vocational courses have been added to the curriculum.\\r\\nThere are currently over 90 sixth form colleges in England and Wales. Most perform extremely well in national examination league tables. In addition, they offer a broader range of courses at a lower cost per student than most school sixth forms. In a few areas, authorities run sixth form schools which function like sixth form colleges but are completely under the control of the local education authorities. Unlike further education colleges, sixth form colleges rarely accept part-time students or run evening classes,[citation needed] although one boarding sixth form college exists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few schools in Brunei providing sixth form education. Five of them are dedicated sixth form colleges, with four located in Brunei-Muara District and one in Tutong District. Belait has yet to have its own sixth form centre and sixth form education is presently housed in Sayyidina Ali Secondary School, sharing facilities with the secondary education. There is no sixth form education in Temburong  prospective students go to sixth form colleges in Brunei-Muara where they may stay in dormitories.\\r\\nAlmost all sixth form schools are government schools. Five of them provide education leading up to Brunei-Cambridge GCE A Level qualification. Jerudong International School is the only non-government school which has sixth form education and its A Level is independent of those offered by its counterpart.\\r\\nAnother school, Hassanil Bolkiah Boys' Arabic Secondary School, is a government sixth form centre for students in the specialised Arabic stream. Instead of A Level subjects, students generally learn subjects pertaining to Islamic knowledge in Arabic medium. The schooling culminates in the sitting of Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Ugama Brunei (STPUB), translatable as the Higher Certificate of Brunei Religious Education. They may then proceed to Islamic universities, locally or abroad such as Al-Azhar University.\\r\\nIn the English-speaking Caribbean, there are many sixth form colleges, usually attached to secondary schools. Students must usually attain a grade A-C in 1-3 in the Caribbean Examinations Council (C.X.C), examinations. Students that fail these exams are not accepted into the sixth form program and either can do courses in other tertiary facilities, or begin working with high school degrees. After sixth form, students are presented with an Associate Degree.\\r\\nScotland does not, in general, have separate sixth form colleges (or, indeed, the same concept of the terminal two years of secondary education as being distinct from the other time spent there); as such, Scottish students who opt to remain in full-time education will typically remain in the same school for fifth and sixth year (the equivalent to the English lower- and upper-sixth forms), studying Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. Higher Grade qualifications can be taken in both the fifth and sixth years.\\r\\nThe first comprehensive intake sixth form college in England was established in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, and took its first intake of students in September 1964. Since then sixth form colleges have spread across the UK and have proved popular with students, their parents, and other groups in the community. Until 1992, these colleges were controlled and funded by local education authorities (LEAs), but the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 transferred all institutions within the sector to the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), a national agency with strategic responsibility for the operation of general further education (FE) colleges. Later the FEFC's functions were taken over by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), a reorganisation that included changes in the funding and supervision of sixth form colleges.\\r\\nSixth form colleges take responsibility for their own employment, pensions and pay arrangements with the support and advice of the Sixth Form Colleges' Association (SFCA, formerly SFCF). The SFCA is made up of representative principals from SFCs across the UK. The SFCA sets up several Committees to deliver its range of support services for SFCs as well as facilitating lobbying work with Central Government. Colleges for the most part do not charge full-time daytime students; however, adult students (most of whom attend evening classes) may have to pay a fee (for examinations, tutors' time and other costs).\\r\\nThere are also some sixth form colleges in the independent sector, specialising in A levels for which fees are paid; these are unconnected with the SFCA.\\r\\nIn Wales, sixth form education falls under the remit of the Welsh Assembly, and sixth form colleges are sources of further education alongside FE Colleges and sixth forms integrated into secondary schools. They typically offer the Welsh Baccalaureate and Key Skills qualifications.\\r\\nEven though Hong Kong had changed from having two public examinations to one, its first sixth form college, PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College, remains in operation as an upper secondary college.","input":"What is a sixth form college in the uk?"},{"output":"Mu?arram","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic, Muslim, or Hijri calendar (Arabic: ??????? ??????? at-taqwؐm al-hijrؐ) is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used (often alongside the Gregorian calendar) to date events in many Muslim countries. It is also used by Muslims to determine the proper days of Islamic holidays and rituals, such as the annual period of fasting and the proper time for the pilgrimage to Mecca.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic calendar employs the Hijri era whose epoch was retrospectively established as the Islamic New Year of AD?622. During that year, Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Yathrib (now Medina) and established the first Muslim community (ummah), an event commemorated as the Hijra. In the West, dates in this era are usually denoted AH (Latin: Anno Hegirae, \\"in the year of the Hijra\\") in parallel with the Christian (AD) and Jewish eras (AM). In Muslim countries, it is also sometimes denoted as H[1] from its Arabic form (???? ????????, abbreviated ??). In English, years prior to the Hijra are reckoned as BH (\\"Before the Hijra\\").[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Islamic year is 1439?AH. In the Gregorian calendar, 1439?AH runs from approximately 21 September 2017 to 10 September 2018.[3][needs update]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Central Arabia, especially Mecca, there is a lack of epigraphical evidence but details are found in the writings of Muslim authors of the Abbasid era.  Inscriptions of the ancient South Arabian calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these South Arabian calendars followed the lunisolar system. Both al-Biruni and al-Mas'udi suggest that the Ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of Tihamah, Hejaz, and Najd distinguished between two types of months, permitted (?all) and forbidden (?arm) months. The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the pilgrimage season, Dhu al-Qadah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram. Information about the forbidden months is also found in the writings of Procopius, where he describes an armistice with the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir which happened in the summer of 541 AD. However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The Qur'an links the four forbidden months with Nasؐ, a word that literally means \\"postponement\\".[4] According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of Kinanah,[5] by a man known as the al-Qalammas of Kinanah and his descendants (pl. qalmisa).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent interpretations of the concept of Nasؐ have been proposed.[7] Some scholars, both Muslim[8][9] and Western,[4][5] maintain that the pre-Islamic calendar used in Central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, Nasؐ is related to the pre-Islamic practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like Ibn Hisham, Ibn Manzur, and the corpus of Qur'anic exegesis.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is corroborated by an early Sabaic inscription, where a religious ritual was \\"postponed\\"  (ns'w) due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ns' has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of Nasؐ.[4] Thus the Encyclopaedia of Islam concludes \\"The Arabic system of [Nasؐ] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the Hijra it was transformed into a lunisolar calendar containing an intercalary month added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi, and later by al-Biruni,[6][12] al-Mas'udi, and some Western scholars.[13] This interpretation considers Nasؐ to be a synonym to the Arabic word for \\"intercalation\\" (kabؐsa). The Arabs, according to one explanation mentioned by Abu Ma'shar, learned of this type of intercalation from the Jews.[5][6][12] The Jewish Nasi was the official who decided when to intercalate the Jewish calendar.[14] Some sources say that the Arabs followed the Jewish practice and intercalated seven months over nineteen years, or else that they intercalated nine months over 24 years; there is, however, no consensus among scholars on this issue.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tenth year of the Hijra, as documented in the Qur'an (Sura At-Tawba (9):36ÿ37), Muslims believe God revealed the \\"prohibition of the Nasؐ\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of the months, with God, is twelve in the Book of God, the day that He created the heavens and the earth; four of them are sacred. That is the right religion. So wrong not each other during them. And fight the unbelievers totally even as they fight you totally and know that God is with the godfearing.\\r\\nKnow that intercalation (nasi) is an addition to disbelief. Those who disbelieve are led to error thereby, making it lawful in one year and forbidden in another in order to adjust the number of (the months) made sacred by God and make the sacred ones permissible. The evil of their course appears pleasing to them. But God gives no guidance to those who disbelieve. \\r\\nThe prohibition of Nasؐ would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month had returned to its position just before the month of Nasi' began. If Nasؐ' meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between 1 AH and 10 AH are uncertain; Western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench, should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two or even three lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the farewell sermon which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah 10 AH (Julian date Friday 6 March, AD 632) on Mount Arafat during the farewell pilgrimage to Mecca.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly the Nasi is an impious addition, which has led the infidels into error. One year they authorise the Nasi, another year they forbid it. They observe the divine precept with respect to the number of the sacred months, but in fact they profane that which God has declared to be inviolable, and sanctify that which God has declared to be profane. Assuredly time, in its revolution, has returned to such as it was at the creation of the heavens and the earth. In the eyes of God the number of the months is twelve. Among these twelve months four are sacred, namely, Rajab, which stands alone, and three others which are consecutive.\\r\\nThe three successive sacred (forbidden) months mentioned by Prophet Muhammad (months in which battles are forbidden) are Dhu al-Qadah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram, months 11, 12, and 1 respectively. The single forbidden month is Rajab, month 7. These months were considered forbidden both within the new Islamic calendar and within the old pagan Meccan calendar.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour of the twelve Hijri months are considered sacred: Rajab (7), and the three consecutive months of Dh al-Qadah (11), Dhu al-?ijjah (12) and Mu?arram (1).[19] As the lunar calendar lags behind the solar calendar by about ten days every Gregorian year, months of the Islamic calendar fall in different parts of the Gregorian calendar each year. The cycle repeats every 33 lunar years.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach month of the Islamic calendar commences on the birth of the new lunar cycle. Traditionally this is based on actual observation of the crescent (hilal) marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the moon, astronomical positioning of the earth and weather conditions. However, certain sects and groups, most notably Bohras Muslims namely Alavis, Dawoodis and Sulaymanis and Shia Ismaili Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth month in a leap year) and even months have 29.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Arabic, the \\"first day\\" of the week corresponds with Sunday of the planetary week. The Islamic weekdays, like those in the Hebrew and Bah' calendars, begin at sunset. The Christian liturgical day, kept in monasteries, begins with vespers (see vesper), which is evening, in line with the other Abrahamic traditions. Christian and planetary weekdays begin at the following midnight. Muslims gather for worship at a mosque at noon on \\"gathering day\\" (Yawm al-Jumah, yawm ??? meaning \\"day\\") which corresponds with Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus \\"gathering day\\" is often regarded as the weekly day of rest. This is frequently made official, with many Muslim countries adopting Friday and Saturday (e.g., Egypt, Saudi Arabia) or Thursday and Friday as official weekends, during which offices are closed; other countries (e.g., Iran) choose to make Friday alone a day of rest. A few others (e.g., Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco, Nigeria) have adopted the Saturday-Sunday weekend while making Friday a working day with a long midday break to allow time off for worship.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia, it was customary to identify a year after a major event which took place in it. Thus, according to Islamic tradition, Abraha, governor of Yemen, then a province of the Christian Kingdom of Aksum (Ethiopia), attempted to destroy the Kaaba with an army which included several elephants. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year became known as the Year of the Elephant, during which Muhammad was born (sura al-Fil). Most equate this to the year AD 570, but a minority use AD 571.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first ten years of the Hijra were not numbered, but were named after events in the life of Muhammad according to Ab Ray?n al-Bؐrnؐ:[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn AD 638 (17 AH), Abu Musa Ashaari, one of the officials of the Caliph Umar in Basrah, complained about the absence of any years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims. After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should include the date of Muhammad's arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad's arrival). Uthman ibn Affan then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time. The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad's arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi' I.[1] Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijra calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day of the first month of the Islamic calendar (1 Muharram 1 AH) was set to the first new moon after the day the Prophet moved from Quba' to Medina (originally 26 Rabi' I on the pre-Islamic calendar[23]) i.e., Friday, 16 July AD 622, the equivalent civil tabular date (same daylight period) in the Julian calendar.[24][25] The Islamic day began at the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July. This Julian date (16 July) was determined by medieval Muslim astronomers by projecting back in time their own tabular Islamic calendar, which had alternating 30- and 29-day months in each lunar year plus eleven leap days every 30 years. For example, al-Biruni mentioned this Julian date in the year AD 1000.[26] Although not used by either medieval Muslim astronomers or modern scholars to determine the Islamic epoch, the thin crescent moon would have also first become visible (assuming clouds did not obscure it) shortly after the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July, 1.5 days after the associated dark moon (astronomical new moon) on the morning of 14 July.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Cook and Crone in Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World cite a coin from 17 AH, the first surviving attested use of a Hijri calendar date alongside a date in another calendar (Coptic) is on a papyrus from Egypt in 22 AH, PERF 558.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the fact that the Islamic calendar relies on certain variable methods of observation which are used to determine its month-start-dates, the start-dates of its months sometimes vary slightly from the month-start-dates of the astronomical lunar calendar, which are based directly on astronomical calculations. Still, the Islamic calendar seldom varies by more than three days from the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, and roughly approximates it.  Both the Islamic calendar and the astronomical-lunar-calendar take no account of the solar year in their calculations, and thus both of these strictly lunar based calendar systems have no ability to reckon the timing of the four seasons of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, a year of 12 lunar months is 354.37 days long.  In this calendar system, lunar months begin precisely at the time of the monthly \\"conjunction\\", when the Moon is located most directly between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a revolution of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e., the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds one day to the Gregorian calendar every four years.[28] The technical details of the adjustment are described in Tabular Islamic calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates.[29] Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually in no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the hilal (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries.  Still, due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days out of synch with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis traditional practice for the determination of the start-date of the month is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring the beginning of a new month on its territory. But, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters.[30] Given the fact that the moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its \\"age\\" since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48 hour period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of Muslim countries try to overcome some of these difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, Malaysia, Indonesia, and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries say they do on this subject, and what they actually do.   In some instances, what a country says it does is impossible.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the somewhat variable nature of the Islamic calendar, in most Muslim countries, the Islamic calendar is used primarily for religious purposes, while the Solar-based Gregorian calendar is still used primarily for matters of commerce and agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Islamic calendar were prepared using astronomical calculations, Muslims throughout the Muslim world could use it to meet all their needs, the way they use the Gregorian calendar today. But, there are divergent views on whether it is licit to do so.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nA majority of theologians oppose the use of calculations (beyond the constraint that each month must be not less than 29 nor more than 30 days) on the grounds that the latter would not conform with Muhammad's recommendation to observe the new moon of Ramadan and Shawal in order to determine the beginning of these months.[34][35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some jurists see no contradiction between Muhammad's teachings and the use of calculations to determine the beginnings of lunar months.[37] They consider that Muhammad's recommendation was adapted to the culture of the times, and should not be confused with the acts of worship.[38][39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the jurists Ahmad Muhammad Shakir and Yusuf al-Qaradawi both endorsed the use of calculations to determine the beginning of all months of the Islamic calendar, in 1939 and 2004 respectively.[41][42] So did the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA) in 2006[43][44] and the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) in 2007.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major Muslim associations of France also announced in 2012 that they would henceforth use a calendar based on astronomical calculations, taking into account the criteria of the possibility of crescent sighting in any place on Earth.[47] But, shortly after the official adoption of this rule by the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) in 2013, the new leadership of the association decided, on the eve of Ramadan 2013, to follow the Saudi announcement rather than to apply the rule just adopted. This resulted in a division of the Muslim community of France, with some members following the new rule, and others following the Saudi announcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsma'ili-Taiyebi Bohras having the institution of da'i al-mutlaq follow the tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) prepared on the basis of astronomical calculations from the days of Fatimid imams.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkish Muslims use an Islamic calendar which is calculated several years in advance (currently up to 1444 AH/2022 CE) by the Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet ??leri Ba?kanl???). From 1 Muharrem 1400 AH (21 November 1979) until 29 Zilhicce 1435 (24 October 2014) the computed Turkish lunar calendar was based on the following rule: \\"The lunar month is assumed to begin on the evening when, within some region of the terrestrial globe, the computed centre of the lunar crescent at local sunset is more than 5 above the local horizon and (geocentrically) more than 8 from the Sun.\\" In the current rule the (computed) lunar crescent has to be above the local horizon of Ankara at sunset.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaudi Arabia uses the sighting method to determine the beginning of each month of the Hijri calendar. Since AH 1419 (1998/99) several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month. Nevertheless, the religious authorities also allow the testimony of less experienced observers and thus often announce the sighting of the lunar crescent on a date when none of the official committees could see it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country also uses the Umm al-Qura calendar, based on astronomical calculations, but this is restricted to administrative purposes. The parameters used in the establishment of this calendar underwent significant changes over the past decade.[49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore AH 1420 (before 18 April 1999), if the moon's age at sunset in Riyadh was at least 12 hours, then the day ending at that sunset was the first day of the month. This often caused the Saudis to celebrate holy days one or even two days before other predominantly Muslim countries, including the dates for the Hajj, which can only be dated using Saudi dates because it is performed in Mecca.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor AH 1420ÿ22, if moonset occurred after sunset at Mecca, then the day beginning at that sunset was the first day of a Saudi month, essentially the same rule used by Malaysia, Indonesia, and others (except for the location from which the hilal was observed).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the Islamic Society of North America, the Fiqh Council of North America and the European Council for Fatwa and Research announced that they will henceforth use a calendar based on calculations using the same parameters as the Umm al-Qura calendar to determine (well in advance) the beginning of all lunar months (and therefore the days associated with all religious observances). This was intended as a first step on the way to unify, at some future time, Muslims' calendars throughout the world.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1 October 2016, as a cost-cutting measure, Saudi Arabia no longer uses the Islamic calendar for paying the monthly salaries of government employees but the Gregorian calendar.[53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Solar Hijri calendar is a solar calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan which counts its years from the Hijra or migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in AD 622.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tabular Islamic calendar is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar, in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation. It has a 30-year cycle with 11 leap years of 355 days and 19 years of 354 days. In the long term, it is accurate to one day in about 2,500 solar years or 2,570 lunar years. It also deviates up to about one or two days in the short term.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft uses the \\"Kuwaiti algorithm\\", a variant of the tabular Islamic calendar,[55] to convert Gregorian dates to the Islamic ones. Microsoft claimed that the variant is based on a statistical analysis of historical data from Kuwait, however it matches a known tabular calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant dates in the Islamic (Hijri) year are:\\r\\n\\r\\nDays considered important predominantly for Shia Muslims:\\r\\n\\r\\nDays considered important for Sunni Muslims (especially in India & parts of Asia):\\r\\n\\r\\nConversions may be made by using the Tabular Islamic calendar, or, for greatest accuracy (one day in 15,186 years), via the Jewish calendar. Theoretically, the days of the months correspond in both calendars if the displacements which are a feature of the Jewish system are ignored. The table below gives, for nineteen years, the Muslim month which corresponds to the first Jewish month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table may be extended since every nineteen years the Muslim month number increases by seven. When it goes above twelve, subtract twelve and add one to the year AH. From AD412 to AD632 inclusive the month number is 1 and the calculation gives the month correct to a month or so. AD622 corresponds to BH1 and AH1. For earlier years, year BH = (623 or 622) ÿ year AD).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example calculation: What is the civil date and year AH of the first day of the first month in the year AD?20875?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe first find the Muslim month number corresponding to the first month of the Jewish year which begins in AD20874. Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12. Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12. 2026 is chosen because it gives the same remainder on division by 19 as 20874. The two years are therefore (1098ÿ106)=992G19 years apart. The Muslim month number corresponding to the first Jewish month is therefore 992G7=6944 higher than in 2026. To convert into years and months divide by twelve ÿ 6944/12=578 years and 8 months. Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y ÿ 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m. Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in AD20874 corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH20874. The worked example in Conversion between Jewish and civil dates, shows that the civil date of the first day of this month (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June. The year AH20875 will therefore begin seven months later, on the first day of the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, AD20875 (again ignoring the displacements). The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA reading of the section which follows will show that the year AH20875 is wholly contained within the year AD20875, also that in the Gregorian calendar this correspondence will occur one year earlier. The reason for the discrepancy is that the Gregorian year (like the Julian) is slightly too long, so the Gregorian date for a given AH date will be earlier and the Muslim calendar catches up sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Islamic year will be entirely within a Gregorian year of the same number in the year 20874, after which year the number of the Islamic year will always be greater than the number of the concurrent civil year. The Islamic calendar year of 1429 occurred entirely within the civil calendar year of 2008. Such years occur once every 33 or 34 Islamic years (32 or 33 civil years). More are listed here:\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause a Hijri or Islamic lunar year is between 10 and 12 days shorter than a civil year, it begins 10ÿ12 days earlier in the civil year following the civil year in which the previous Hijri year began. Once every 33 or 34 Hijri years, or once every 32 or 33 civil years, the beginning of a Hijri year (1 Muharram) coincides with one of the first ten days of January. Subsequent Hijri New Years move backward through the civil year back to the beginning of January again, passing through each civil month from December to January.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic calendar is now used primarily for religious purposes, and for official dating of public events and documents in Muslim countries. Because of its nature as a purely lunar calendar, it cannot be used for agricultural purposes and historically Islamic communities have used other calendars for this purpose: the Egyptian calendar was formerly widespread in Islamic countries, and the Iranian calendar and the 1789 Ottoman calendar (a modified Julian calendar) were also used for agriculture in their countries.[citation needed] In the Levant and Iraq the Aramaic names of the Babylonian calendar are still used for all secular matters.[citation needed] In Morocco, the Berber calendar (another Julian calendar) is still used by farmers in the countryside.[citation needed] These local solar calendars have receded in importance with the near-universal adoption of the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.[citation needed] The Saudi Arabia uses the lunar Islamic calendar.[56] In Indonesia, the Javanese calendar, created by Sultan Agung in 1633, combines elements of the Islamic and pre-Islamic Saka calendars.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish author Nicholas Hagger writes that after seizing control of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi \\"declared\\" on 1 December 1978 \\"that the Muslim calendar should start with the death of the prophet Mohammed in 632 rather than the hijra (Mohammed's 'emigration' from Mecca to Medina) in 622\\". This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar.[57] However, according to the 2006 Encyclopedia of the Developing World, \\"More confusing still is Qaddafi's unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet's birth, or sometimes from his death. The months July and August, named after Julius and Augustus Caesar, are now Nasser and Hannibal respectively.\\"[58] Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, \\"Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year it was. The year of my visit was officially 1369. But just two years earlier Libyans had been living through 1429. No one could quite name for me the day the count changed, especially since both remained in play.?...

January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar, since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period. They were added by Numa Pompilius about 713 BC. February remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the decemvirs (c. 450?BC), when it became the second month. At certain intervals February was truncated to 23 or 24 days, and a 27-day intercalary month, Intercalaris, was inserted immediately after February to realign the year with the seasons.\\r\\nFebruary observances in Ancient Rome include Amburbium (precise date unknown), Sementivae (February 2), Februa (February 13ÿ15), Lupercalia (February 13ÿ15), Parentalia (February 13ÿ22), Quirinalia (February 17), Feralia (February 21), Caristia (February 22), Terminalia (February 23), Regifugium (February 24), and Agonium Martiale (February 27). These days do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\\r\\nUnder the reforms that instituted the Julian calendar, Intercalaris was abolished, leap years occurred regularly every fourth year, and in leap years February gained a 29th day. Thereafter, it remained the second month of the calendar year, meaning the order that months are displayed (January, February, March,?..., December) within a year-at-a-glance calendar. Even during the Middle Ages, when the numbered Anno Domini year began on March 25 or December 25, the second month was February whenever all twelve months were displayed in order. The Gregorian calendar reforms made slight changes to the system for determining which years were leap years and thus contained a 29-day February.\\r\\nHistorical names for February include the Old English terms Solmonath (mud month) and Kale-monath (named for cabbage) as well as Charlemagne's designation Hornung. In Finnish, the month is called helmikuu, meaning \\"month of the pearl\\"; when snow melts on tree branches, it forms droplets, and as these freeze again, they are like pearls of ice. In Polish and Ukrainian, respectively, the month is called luty or ҳ, meaning the month of ice or hard frost. In Macedonian the month is sechko (ۿ), meaning month of cutting [wood]. In Czech, it is called ~nor, meaning month of submerging [of river ice].\\r\\nIn Slovene, February is traditionally called sve?an, related to icicles or Candlemas.[2] This name originates from si?an,[3] written as svi?an in the New Carniolan Almanac from 1775 and changed to its final form by Franc Metelko in his New Almanac from 1824. The name was also spelled se?an, meaning \\"the month of cutting down of trees\\".[2]\\r\\nIn 1848, a proposal was put forward in Kmetijske in rokodelske novice by the Slovene Society of Ljubljana to call this month talnik (related to ice melting), but it did not stick. The idea was proposed by a priest, Bla? Poto?nik.[4] Another name of February in Slovene was vesnar, after the mythological character Vesna.[5]\\r\\nHaving only 28 days in common years, February is the only month of the year that can pass without a single full moon. Using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis for determining the date and time of a full moon, this last happened in 2018 and will next happen in 2037.[6][7] The same is true regarding a new moon: again using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis, this last happened in 2014 and will next happen in 2033.[8][9]\\r\\nFebruary is also the only month of the calendar that, once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively, either back into the past or forward into the future, has four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday; this occurred in 1965, 1971, 1982, 1993, 1999 and 2010, and occur will again in 2021. In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday, with the next occurrence in 2026, and previous occurrences in 1987, 1998, 2009 and 2015.

He also predicted that pay-per-view viewership of the hypothetical bout could possibly rival Mayweather vs. Pacquiao.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 7, 2017, Mayweather called upon McGregor to \\"sign the paper\\" and \\"make it happen\\", arguing that \\"if Conor McGregor really wants this fight to happen, stop blowing smoke up everybody's ass.\\"[16] On March 10, 2017, Mayweather stated that only a fight with McGregor would make him come out of retirement.[17] On March 16, 2017, Dana White backpedaled on his stance against a MayweatherÿMcGregor bout and said that he would not deprive McGregor of a massive payday.[18][19] On May 18, 2017, McGregor reportedly agreed to all of Mayweather's updated terms and signed the contract.[20] The official confirmation of the fight was made on June 14.[21] An international press tour was held from July 11ÿ14.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, IBF junior lightweight champion Gervonta Davis was reported to be going to participate in a co-main event.[23]  Earlier in 2017 McGregor called Mayweather a Malteser with eyeballs.[24] On July 19, additional undercard details were released.[25] By that time, three names had been confirmed on the undercard, including British amateur boxer Savannah Marshall, who signed up earlier in the year with Mayweather Promotions, and Badou Jack, who stepped up to fight at light heavyweight.[26] On July 26, 2017, it was announced that former welterweight titleholder Shawn Porter would be headlining the preliminary card, facing Thomas Dulorme.[27][28] On August 17, Porter pulled out of the fight due to personal reasons, including a death in the family. He was replaced by Cuban boxer Yordenis Ugs.[29] On July 29, it was reported that Gervonta Davis would defend his IBF junior lightweight title against former WBO champion Roman 'Rocky' Martinez.[30] Martnez was dropped due to not having enough time to make the 130 pound [59?kg] limit.[31] Instead Davis has been rescheduled to fight unbeaten prospect Francisco Fonseca.[32] On August 9, 2017, it was announced that Nathan Cleverly would defend his WBA light heavyweight title against Money Team fighter Badou Jack.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nA mural was painted in McGregor's Dublin training facility, Straight Blast Gym, depicting McGregor hitting Mayweather with a left-handed punch.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the fight was televised via Showtime pay-per-view, available through both traditional television providers and various digital services, including the Showtime PPV website and apps, and UFC.tv. Fathom Events organized public screenings at venues such as movie theaters.[36][37][38] On July 10, 2017, it was announced that pricing for the PPV in the U.S. would mirror that of Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, being set at US$89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for high definition).[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fight was called by Showtime's lead commentary team of Mauro Ranallo (play-by-play), Al Bernstein (color), and Paulie Malignaggi (color), along with ringside reporter Jim Gray.[40] Showtime produced a four-part documentary series, All Access: Mayweather vs. McGregor, focusing on the preparations for the fight.[41] Fox Sports (the television rightsholder of the UFC) provided shoulder programming for the fight, including coverage of the press tour on UFC Tonight, as well as a pre-show and preliminary card on Fox and Fox Deportes.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the high demand, a large number of television providers, as well as UFC.tv, experienced technical issues with their carriage of the PPV, including errors, buffering and low video quality. The main event was delayed by an hour from its projected start time in order to address these problems. Following the fight, a class-action lawsuit was proposed in Oregon against Showtime Networks for unlawful trading practices and unjust enrichment, alleging that the network knowingly advertised a level of quality it was unable to deliver with the amount of bandwidth it allocated for the PPV stream.[42][43] Showtime and the UFC stated that they were investigating their respective customer complaints, and would issue refunds on a case-by-case basis.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nSky Sports Box Office  held broadcasting rights to the fight in McGregor's native Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Although it was initially believed that the price would match that of the U.S. PPV, the price was set at ?24.95 (S19.95).[45] The fight was called for Sky Sports by Johnny Nelson and Carl Froch, joined by British MMA fighter and UFC analyst Dan Hardy.[46] British radio rights were held by the BBC, with Mike Costello and Steve Bunce on commentary for BBC Radio 5 Live.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hispanic America, the fight  aired on Fox Premium Action.[48] In Brazil, the event  aired on Globosat-owned Combate.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, it was expected that many viewers would seek unauthorized streams of the fight due to the high cost of the PPV. Showtime successfully received a preliminary injunction against the registrant of a group of 44 websites who planned to illegally stream the fight in violation of its copyrights, and all parties in active concert or participation with them.[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was estimated that nearly 2.93 million viewers illegally streamed the fight, on video streaming websites and social media channels such as Facebook, YouTube and Periscope.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nMayweather was expected to earn at least $100 million, increasing up to four times that amount upon the event achieving all  its metrics.[54] McGregor was expected to earn $75 million, but both men signed NDAs barring them from publicly communicating the financial details.[55] According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a Q&A session in Glasgow in September 2017, McGregor revealed, had he been disqualified, he would have been fined $10 million. The referee also warned him, had he lifted a leg, he would have not been warned and got a straight point deduction.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fight Conor McGregor revealed that he earned around $100 million in total.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuaranteed Base Purses[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 23, 2017, the WBC revealed that the inaugural \\"Money Belt\\" would be on the line; it is made from Italian-made alligator leather and encrusted with 3.3 pounds (1.5?kg) of 24-karat gold, 3,360 diamonds, 600 sapphires, and 300 emeralds.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 16, 2017, the officials were named for the fight:[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth athletes initially agreed to box in 10-ounce (285 g) gloves per Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) rules which require 10-ounce (285 g) gloves for boxing matches contracted over 147 pounds [67?kg] (the fight is contracted at 154 pounds [70?kg]).[63]  McGregor wanted 8-ounce (225 g) gloves and Mayweather agreed, and both athletes submitted formal requests to box in 8-ounce (225 g) gloves, which was granted by the NSAC.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts expected that more money would be bet on the fight than any other boxing match in history; estimates ranged up to   $85 million in bets.[64][65] There were six separate $1 million bets on Mayweather in Las Vegas bookmakers, but a large majority of bets overall were on the underdog, McGregor.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold and 137 complimentary tickets given out. This was far less than the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight which grossed $72,198,500 from a paid attendance of 16,219 in 2015, despite claims from Ellerbe and Mayweather that it did more than $80 million.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nSky Sports initially estimated the fight garnered over a million PPV buys in the UK and grossed in excess of S20 million, which would've surpassed the record set in April 2017 when Anthony Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 at the Wembley Stadium. This would've also meant the fight generated more buys in the UK than Mayweather-Pacquiao which took place in 2015.[67] Figures later revealed by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board showed the MayweatherÿMcGregor fight drew 874,000 PPV buys in the UK.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nShowtime Sports Stephen Espinoza told the LA Times the fight was expected to generate around 4.4 million domestic buys, which would fall just short of the 4.6 million record which was set by Mayweather-Pacquiao.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 14, 2017, Showtime officially announced 4.3 million domestic buys, making it the 2nd highest buy rate in pay-per-view history.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the weigh-in, Mayweather tipped the scales at 149.5?lbs, with McGregor at 153?lbs.[71] Mayweather and McGregor entered the ring following the Irish and American national anthems; the Irish singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Imelda May performed on behalf of Conor McGregor,[72] followed by the American singer-songwriter and actress Demi Lovato, who was personally chosen by Mayweather.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nMayweather was expected to dominate the fight early, but McGregor started strong and was ahead on one judge's card cards for the first few rounds, due in part to Mayweather using the rope-a-dope technique in the early stages. Because of this, the fight looked closer than it actually was due to Mayweather abandoning his usual stick-and-move style in order to knock McGregor out. [74] As the fight progressed, McGregor weakened. As the fight reached the 25-minute mark, when MMA fights end (five rounds of five minutes), Mayweather began to attack.  In Round 9, Mayweather landed a series of punches to McGregor's face, and the onslaught continued into Round 10, when referee Robert Byrd eventually called the fight in favor of Mayweather after McGregor failed to defend himself.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the match Mayweather stated that he had expected McGregor to be a fast starter, and had allowed him to deliver his heavy blows early.[76][77] McGregor on the other hand was disappointed by what he saw as an early stoppage, but respected the referee's decision. Former boxers such as George Foreman and Evander Holyfield expressed their impression regarding McGregor's boxing skills and the competitiveness of the fight,[78][79] with Foreman claiming that experts who criticized the fight \\"should apologize. It was competitive\\".[80] Mike Tyson gave McGregor an \\"A grade\\" for his performance, stating he was impressed.[81] The fight was lauded for its entertaining and exciting nature, especially when compared to Mayweather's most recent bouts.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nMayweather announced in his post-fight interview that he had fought his final boxing match, and would officially retire from the sport. Mayweather stated \\"Any guy that's calling me out? Forget it,\\" putting an end to his boxing career.[83] McGregor said in his post-fight interview that he would be willing to box again, and that he would return to mixed martial arts and the UFC.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGervonta Davis failed to make weight at the August 25 weigh in, forcing the IBF to strip him of his title. The title was declared vacant, but would still be on the line for Francisco Fonseca if he secured victory.[84] Davis would go on to win by KO in the eighth round. Nathan Cleverly lost his WBA light heavyweight title to Badou Jack in a one-sided bout which ended when the referee stopped the fight in the fifth.[85] Cleverly retired from boxing after the fight.[86]","input":"Who won the fight conor mcgregor or floyd mayweather?"},{"output":"The law was challenged by the ACLU in the famed Scopes Trial","context":"John Washington Butler in the House of Representatives as House Bill No. 185 on January 21, 1925\\r\\nThe Butler Act was a 1925 Tennessee law prohibiting public school teachers from denying the Biblical account of mankind's origin. It was enacted as Tennessee Code Annotated Title 49 (Education) Section 1922, having been signed into law by Tennessee governor Austin Peay. The law also prevented the teaching of the evolution of man from what it referred to as lower orders of animals in place of the Biblical account.\\r\\nThe law was challenged later that year in a famous trial in Dayton, Tennessee called the Scopes Trial which included a raucous confrontation between prosecution attorney and fundamentalist religious leader, William Jennings Bryan, and noted defense attorney and religious agnostic, Clarence Darrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law, \\"An act prohibiting the teaching of the Evolution Theory in all the Universities, and all other public schools of Tennessee, which are supported in whole or in part by the public school funds of the State, and to provide penalties for the violations thereof\\" (Tenn. HB 185, 1925) specifically provided:\\r\\nIt additionally outlined that an offending teacher would be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined between $100 and $500 for each offense.\\r\\nBy the terms of the statute, it could be argued, it was not illegal to teach evolution in respect to non-human creatures, such as that apes descended from protozoa or to teach the mechanisms of variation and natural selection. The bill also did not touch on, or restrict the teaching of prevailing scientific theories of geology or the age of the Earth. It did not even require that the Genesis story be taught, but prohibited solely the teaching that man evolved, or any other theory denying that man was created by God as recorded in Genesis. However the author of the law, a Tennessee farmer named John Washington Butler, specifically intended that it would prohibit the teaching of evolution. He later was reported to have said, \\"No, I didn't know anything about evolution when I introduced it. I'd read in the papers that boys and girls were coming home from school and telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense.\\" After reading copies of William Jennings Bryan's lecture \\"Is the Bible True?\\" as well as Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man,[citation needed] Butler decided the teaching of evolution was dangerous.\\r\\nThe law was challenged by the ACLU in the famed Scopes Trial, in which John Scopes, a high school science teacher who agreed to be arrested on a charge of having taught evolution, and was nominally served a warrant on May 5, 1925. Scopes was indicted on May 25 and ultimately convicted; on appeal the Tennessee Supreme Court found the law to be constitutional under the Tennessee State Constitution, because:\\r\\nWe are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory.  Scopes v. State 289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927)\\r\\nDespite this decision, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the conviction on a technicality (that the jury should have fixed the amount of the fine), and the case was not retried. During the trial, Butler told reporters: \\"I never had any idea my bill would make a fuss. I just thought it would become a law, and that everybody would abide by it and that we wouldn't hear any more of evolution in Tennessee.\\"\\r\\nThe law remained on the books until 1967, when teacher Gary L. Scott of Jacksboro, Tennessee, who had been dismissed for violation of the act, sued for reinstatement, citing his First Amendment right to free speech. Although his termination was rescinded, Scott continued his fight with a class action lawsuit in the Nashville Federal District Court, seeking a permanent injunction against enforcement of that law. Within three days of his filing suit, a bill for repeal of the Butler Act had passed both houses of the Tennessee legislature and was signed into law May 18 by Governor Buford Ellington.[2]","input":"What was one result of the butler act?"},{"output":"January 16, 1920.","context":"The Eighteenth Amendment (Amendment XVIII) of the United States Constitution effectively established the prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the United States by declaring the production, transport, and sale of alcohol (though not the consumption or private possession) illegal. The separate Volstead Act set down methods for enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment, and defined which \\"intoxicating liquors\\" were prohibited, and which were excluded from prohibition (e.g., for medical and religious purposes). The Amendment was the first to set a time delay before it would take effect following ratification, and the first to set a time limit for its ratification by the states. The requisite number of states had ratified it by January 16, 1919, with the amendment taking effect on January 16, 1920.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 1.

The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\\r\\nSection 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.\\r\\nThe Eighteenth Amendment was the result of decades of effort by the temperance movement in the United States and at the time was generally considered a progressive amendment.[1] Starting in 1906, the Anti-Saloon League (ASL) began leading a campaign to ban the sale of alcohol on a state level. They led speeches, advertisements, and public demonstrations, claiming that banning the sale of alcohol would get rid of poverty and social issues, such as immoral behavior and violence. A well-known reformer during this time period was Carrie Amelia Moore Nation, whose violent actions (such as vandalizing saloon property) made her a household name across America.[2]\\r\\nMany state legislatures had already enacted statewide prohibition prior to the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment but did not ban the consumption of alcohol in most households. By 1916, 23 of 48 states had already passed laws against saloons, some even banning the manufacture of alcohol in the first place.[3]\\r\\nOn August 1, 1917, the Senate passed a resolution containing the language of the amendment to be presented to the states for ratification. The vote was 65 to 20, with the Democrats voting 36 in favor and 12 in opposition; and the Republicans voting 29 in favor and 8 in opposition. The House of Representatives passed a revised resolution[4] on December 17, 1917.\\r\\nIn the House, the vote was 282 to 128, with the Democrats voting 141 in favor and 64 in opposition; and the Republicans voting 137 in favor and 62 in opposition. Four Independents in the House voted in favor and two Independents cast votes against the amendment.[5] It was officially proposed by the Congress to the states when the Senate passed the resolution, by a vote of 47 to 8, the next day, December 18.[6]\\r\\nThe amendment and its enabling legislation did not ban the consumption of alcohol, but made it difficult to obtain alcoholic beverages legally, as it prohibited the sale and distribution of them in U.S. territory.\\r\\nThe ratification of the Amendment was completed on January 16, 1919, when Nebraska became the 36th of the 48 states then in the Union to ratify it. On January 29, acting Secretary of State Frank L. Polk certified the ratification.[7]\\r\\nThe following states ratified the amendment:[8]\\r\\nThe following states rejected the amendment:\\r\\nTo define the language used in the Amendment, Congress enacted enabling legislation called the National Prohibition Act, better known as the Volstead Act, on October 28, 1919. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed that bill, but the House of Representatives immediately voted to override the veto and the Senate voted similarly the next day. The Volstead Act set the starting date for nationwide prohibition for January 17, 1920, which was the earliest date allowed by the 18th Amendment.[5]\\r\\nThe proposed amendment was the first to contain a provision setting a deadline for its ratification. That clause of the amendment was challenged, with the case reaching the US Supreme Court. It upheld the constitutionality of such a deadline in Dillon v. Gloss (1921). The Supreme Court also upheld the ratification by the Ohio legislature in Hawke v. Smith (1920), despite a petition requiring that the matter go to ballot.\\r\\nThis was not the only controversy around the amendment. The phrase \\"intoxicating liquor\\" would not logically have included beer and wine, and their inclusion in the prohibition came as a surprise to the general public, as well as wine and beer makers.[12]\\r\\nJust after the Eighteenth Amendment's adoption, there was a significant reduction in alcohol consumption among the general public and particularly among low-income groups. However, consumption soon climbed as underworld entrepreneurs began producing \\"rotgut\\" alcohol.[13] Ultimately, during prohibition use and abuse of alcohol ended up higher than before it started.[14]\\r\\nLikewise, there was an initial reduction in overall crime, mainly in the types of crimes associated with the effects of alcohol consumption, though there were significant increases in crimes involved in the production and distribution of illegal alcohol. Those who continued to use alcohol, tended to turn to organised criminal syndicates, who were able to take advantage of uneven enforcement, suddenly overwhelmed police forces, and corruptible public officials to establish powerful, murderous smuggling networks. The murder rate fell for two years, but then rose to record highs, a trend that reversed the very year prohibition ended.[15][16] Overall, crime rose 24%, including increases in assault and battery, theft, and burglary.[17]\\r\\nAnti-prohibition groups arose and worked to have the amendment repealed, once it became apparent that Prohibition was an unprecedented catastrophe.\\r\\nThe Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 5, 1933.[18] The amendment remains the only constitutional amendment to be repealed in its entirety; leaving only the power to regulate transportation solely to the federal government.[19]","input":"When did the 18th amendment go into effect?"},{"output":"Leader of the Council","context":"A Leader of the Council is the leader of the largest political group on a government council.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn local government in England following the Local Government Act 2000 the position of Leader of the Council is used in Cabinet-style councils as an executive position chairing a cabinet.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn local government in Scotland the Leader of the Council is elected as the leader of the largest political grouping of councillors in a local authority.

He has taken a moment of action so transitory that students of athletics still debate if it is feasible, and he has given it the completeness of a cameo.\\"[2] The moment thus captured in the statue is an example of rhythmos, harmony and balance. Myron is often credited with being the first sculptor to master this style. Naturally, as always in Greek athletics, the Discobolus is completely nude. His pose is said to be unnatural to a human, and today considered a rather inefficient way to throw the discus.[3] Also there is very little emotion shown in the discus thrower's face, and \\"to a modern eye, it may seem that Myron's desire for perfection has made him suppress too rigorously the sense of strain in the individual muscles,\\"[2] Clark observes. The other trademark of Myron embodied in this sculpture is how well the body is proportioned, the symmetria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potential energy expressed in this sculpture's tightly wound pose, expressing the moment of stasis just before the release, is an example of the advancement of Classical sculpture from Archaic.

It is a 1st-century AD copy of Myron's original bronze. Following its discovery at a Roman property of the Massimo family, the Villa Palombara on the Esquiline Hill, it was initially restored by Giuseppe Angelini; the Massimi installed it initially in their Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne and then at Palazzo Lancellotti. The Italian archaeologist Giovanni Battista Visconti identified the sculpture as a copy from the original of Myron. It was instantly famous, though the Massimo jealously guarded access to it (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937 Adolf Hitler negotiated to buy it, and eventually succeeded in 1938, when Galeazzo Ciano, Minister of Foreign Affairs, sold it to him for five million lire, over the protests of Giuseppe Bottai, Minister of Education, and the scholarly community. It was shipped by rail to Munich and displayed in the Glyptothek; it was returned in 1948. It is now in the National Museum of Rome, displayed at the Palazzo Massimo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the discovery of the Discobolus Palombara a second notable Discobolus was excavated, at Hadrian's Villa in 1790, and was purchased by the English antiquary and art dealer established in Rome, Thomas Jenkins, at public auction in 1792. (Another example, also found at Tivoli at this date, was acquired by the Vatican Museums.) The English connoisseur Charles Townley paid Jenkins S400 for the statue, which arrived at the semi-public gallery Townley commissioned in Park Street, London, in 1794. The head was wrongly restored, as Richard Payne Knight soon pointed out, but Townley was convinced his was the original and better copy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was bought for the British Museum, with the rest of Townley's marbles, in July 1805.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Roman copies in marble have been recovered, and torsos that were already known in the 17th century but that had been wrongly restored and completed, have since been identified as further repetitions after Myron's model. For one such example, in the early 18th century Pierre-tienne Monnot restored a torso that is now recognized as an example of Myron's Discobolus as a Wounded Gladiator who supports himself on his arm as he sinks to the ground; the completed sculpture was donated before 1734 by Pope Clement XII to the Capitoline Museums, where it remains.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nYet another copy was discovered in 1906 in the ruins of a Roman villa at Tor Paterno in the former royal estate of Castel Porziano, now also conserved in the Museo Nazionale Romano.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 19th century plaster copies of the Discobolos could be found in many large academic collections, now mostly dispersed.","input":"What is the subject matter of myron's discus thrower?"},{"output":"China","context":"The automotive industry is a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and selling of motor vehicles,[1] some of them are called automakers. It is one of the world's most important economic sectors by revenue. The automotive industry does not include industries dedicated to the maintenance of automobiles following delivery to the end-user, such as automobile repair shops and motor fuel filling stations.\\r\\nThe term automotive was created from Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion) to represent any form of self-powered vehicle. This term was proposed by Elmer Sperry.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe automotive industry began in the 1890s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage. For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[3] After World War II, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production, with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units.[4] From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.[5]\\r\\nSafety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk, danger, damage or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the autmobiles themselves, implies that there is no risk of damage.\\r\\nSafety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of norms and regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262, is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive functional safety.[6]\\r\\nIn case of safety issues, danger, product defect or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material.\\r\\nProduct and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.\\r\\nAround the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007, consuming over 980?billion litres (980,000,000?m3) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly.[7] The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicts that, by 2014, one-third of world demand will be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Meanwhile, in the developed countries, the automotive industry has slowed down.[8] It is also expected that this trend will continue, especially as the younger generations of people (in highly urbanized countries) no longer want to own a car anymore, and prefer other modes of transport.[9] Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia.[10] Emerging auto markets already buy more cars than established markets. According to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study, performed in 2010 expected this trend to accelerate.[11][12] However, more recent reports (2012) confirmed the opposite; namely that the automotive industry was slowing down even in BRIC countries.[8] In the United States, vehicle sales peaked in 2000, at 17.8 million units.[13]\\r\\n1960s; Post war increase\\r\\n1970s; Oil crisis and tighter safety and emission regulation.\\r\\n1990s; production started in NICs\\r\\n2000s; rise of China as top producer\\r\\n1950s; UK, Germany and France restarted production.\\r\\n1960s; Japan started production and increased volume through the 1980s.

Dougherty.[8] It expanded to include other programs in 1967, and joined the University of North Carolina system in 1971. It is the system's sixth largest institution with about 17,000 undergraduate and 1,800 graduate students.[9] It offers 176 undergraduate[10] and 42[11] graduate majors as well as a doctoral degree in educational leadership.\\r\\nThe university has been ranked among the top 10 Southern Master's Universities since the U.S. News and World Report's America's Best Colleges Guide began publication in 1986.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAppalachian State University began in 1899 when a group of citizens in Watauga County, under the leadership of Blanford B. Dougherty and his brother Dauphin D. Dougherty, began a movement to educate teachers in northwestern North Carolina.[13] Land was donated by Daniel B. Dougherty, father of the leaders in the enterprise, and by J. F. Hardin. On this site a wood frame building, costing $1,000, was erected by contributions from citizens of the town and county.[14] In the fall of 1899, the Dougherty brothers, acting as co-principals, began the school which was named Watauga Academy. The first year saw 53 students enrolled in three grades.[13]\\r\\nIn 1903, after interest in the school had spread to adjoining counties, D. D. Doughterty was convinced the state would fund institutions established to train teachers. He traveled to the state capital, Raleigh, after drafting a bill.[13] W. C. Newland of Caldwell County introduced the bill in the North Carolina Legislature to make this a state school, with an appropriation for maintenance and for building. Captain E. F. Lovill of Watauga County, R. B. White of Franklin County, Clyde Hoey of Cleveland County and E. J. Justice of McDowell County spoke in favor of the measure. On March 9, 1903, the bill became law, and the Appalachian Training School for Teachers was established. The school opened on October 5, 1903 with $2,000 from the state and 325 students.[13]\\r\\nFor 22 years, there was a period of steady growth, academic development, and valuable service to the state. In 1925, the legislature changed the name to the Appalachian State Normal School and appropriated additional funding for maintenance and permanent improvement. Four years later, in 1929, the school became a four-year degree granting institution and was renamed Appalachian State Teachers College. Over 1,300 students were enrolled in degree programs offered for primary grades education, physical education, math, English, science, and history.[13]\\r\\nAppalachian attained national standards by becoming accredited by the American Association for Teacher Education in 1939, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1942.[13] In 1948 a Graduate School was formed. Dr. Dougherty retired in 1955, after 56 years of serving the school. J. D. Rankin became interim president until Dr. William H. Plemmons was installed. Plemmons lead from 1955 to 1969, and his administration oversaw the addition of new buildings as the campus expanded and enrollment grew to nearly 5,000 students.[13]\\r\\nAppalachian was transformed from a single-purpose teachers' college into a multipurpose regional university and Appalachian State Teacher's College became Appalachian State University in 1967. Growth continued in the 1970s to around 9,500 students and 550 faculty. Afterward, four degree granting undergraduate colleges were created: Arts and Sciences, Business, Fine and Applied Arts, and Education. Dr. Herbert Wey succeeded Plemmons as president in 1969 and was named chancellor in 1971.[13] In 1972 Appalachian State became part of the University of North Carolina system.\\r\\nLocated in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northwestern North Carolina, Appalachian State University has one of the highest elevations of any university in the United States east of the Mississippi River, at 3,333 feet (1,016?m). The university's main campus is in downtown Boone, a town of 18,834[15] compared to an ASU enrollment of 18,811 students.[16] The campus encompasses 1,300 acres (5.3?km2), including a main campus of 410 acres (1.7?km2) with 20 residence halls, 3 main dining facilities, 30 academic buildings, and 11 recreation/athletic facilities.[16]\\r\\nThe center of campus is nicknamed Sanford Mall, an open grassy quad between the student union, dining halls, and library. Sanford Hall, located on the mall's edge, is named for Terry Sanford, a former governor of the state. Rivers Street, a thoroughfare for town and university traffic, essentially divides the campus into east and west sections with underground tunnels and a pedestrian bridge connecting the two halves. The eastern half includes Sanford Mall, Plemmons Student Union, Roess Dining Hall (formerly known as Central Dining Hall), and Belk Library, along with two communities of residence halls. The west side has Trivette Dining Hall, the Student Recreation Center (or SRC), the Quinn Recreation Center, Kidd Brewer Stadium, and Stadium Heights and Yosef Hollow, the two remaining residence hall communities. At the north end, Bodenheimer Drive crosses over Rivers Street and leads to Appalachian Heights (an apartment-style residence hall), Mountaineer Hall, the Chancellor's House, the Living Learning Center, and Jim and Bettie Smith Stadium. The George M. Holmes Convocation Center at the south end of Rivers Street is the gateway and entrance to campus.\\r\\nThe Turchin Center for the Visual Arts on the edge of main campus is the university's visual art center. The Turchin Center is the largest visual arts center in northwestern North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia.[17] It displays rotating exhibits indoors and outdoors, some exhibits being culturally specific to the Appalachians, and offers community outreach programs through art courses. The newly renovated Schaefer Center for the Performing Arts, a 1,635 seat performance venue,[18] hosts artists from around the world.\\r\\nThe University of North Carolina's Board of Governors plans and develops the coordinated system of higher education with the state. They set university policy but delegate Appalachian State's daily operations to a chancellor.[19] The chancellor likewise delegates some duties to the provost, several vice-chancellors, and other administrative offices. These administrative offices are advised by several university committees on the needs of campus constituents, as represented by a Faculty Senate, Staff Senate, Graduate Student Association Senate, and the Student Government Association.\\r\\nIn 2005, the Carol Grotnes Belk Library & Information Commons opened in a new 165,000-square-foot (15,300?m2) five-story building. Belk Library holds over 1,871,000 bound books and periodicals, 1.5?million microforms, 24,000 sound recordings, and 14,000 videos.[28] The Library holds varying collections, including the W.L Eury Appalachian Collection for regional studies and the Stock Car Racing Collection. With the opening of the new library building in 2005, Bill and Maureen Rhinehart of Long Island, New York, donated a large collection of rare books in English history, spanning from the 16th to the 19th centuries.The university created a special collections room for this valuable donation which includes some 900 volumes comprising nearly 450 titles.The entire collection was published in two volumes of an annotated bibliography, comprised by retired English professor Dr. M. John Higby. Both volumes comprise almost 240 pages and are excellent in both scholarship and thoroughness.It was the last major endeavor of his distinguished career in education. The library is also home to an impressive stock car racing collection including a donation from the family of Richard The King Petty. [29] Besides serving university patrons, the library also serves the local community with circulation available to registered patrons.\\r\\nAppalachian State offers 176 undergraduate and 42 graduate majors.[30] The average GPA for incoming freshmen in 2017 was 4.20.[31] Courses at Appalachian are organized into eight colleges and one graduate school:[32]\\r\\nThe College of Arts and Sciences houses 16 programs in the humanities, social sciences, math, and natural science.

ASU also has over 400 clubs and organizations run by the McCaskey Center for Student Involvement and Leadership, such as Greek organizations, academic and diversity clubs, and sports clubs.[47] Before the start of every semester, the University hosts a 'Club Expo' featuring all the clubs and organizations on campus. This event is for students to find an organization or club that suits them and to become involved. The university also has volunteer centers including the Multicultural Center, the LGBT Center, and the Women's Center (which is the only completely volunteer run Women's Center in the state of North Carolina).[48] All three centers are under the supervision of the Multicultural Student Development Office.[49] On November 11, 2016, ASU opened a fourth center in their student union; the Student Veterans Resource Center.\\r\\nThe Appalachian Popular Programming Society (A.P.P.S.) is a university funded organization that exists to plan and provide diverse educational, enriching, and entertaining events for the community and student body of Appalachian State. Through its seven programming councils, A.P.P.S. members select, plan, promote, and present a diverse variety of popular entertainment programs and films which enhance the social and cultural life for Appalachian students.[50] A.P.P.S. was founded in 1985 to help with the student nightlife and to support retention. APPS plays a vital role in fostering and developing an inclusive Appalachian State University community.[51] The seven councils include Appalachian heritage, club shows, concerts, cultural awareness and student engagement (CASE), films, special events, and stage shows. Students can enjoy shows, dances, and concerts at Legends, an entertainment facility located on campus.\\r\\nAppalachian State University leads in creating a world where environmental, societal, and economic qualities exist in balance to meet the resource needs of today and of future generations.\\r\\nAppalachian has made many sustainable strides in recent years such as:\\r\\nAppalachian's sports teams are nicknamed the Mountaineers. The Mountaineers compete in NCAA Division I and are members of the Sun Belt Conference. Appalachian fields varsity teams in 20 sports, 10 for men and 10 for women.[60] The Mountaineer football team started competing in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision in the 2014ÿ2015 academic year.\\r\\nKidd Brewer Stadium is the 30,000 seat home of Appalachian football. Affectionately nicknamed \\"The Rock\\", the stadium is located at an elevation of 3,333 feet (1,016?m). In 2017, App State added a new video board, sound system and LED ribbon displays. Kidd Brewer Stadium also offers additional stadium seating with 18 luxury suites, 600 club seats, and the Chancellor's Box areas that offer a great view of the field and campus.\\r\\nThe George M. Holmes Convocation Center is the home court for Appalachian's basketball teams. The 200,840-square-foot (18,659?m2) arena, with seating for 8,325, is also the home for volleyball and indoor track and field. In 2017, a new Daktronics video board was installed. The board is made up of nine displays totaling a square footage of 1,200.\\r\\nUniversity Recreation (UREC) also offers 20 club sports that compete with other regional institutions on a non-varsity level.

The team competes in every discipline of bicycle racing that is acknowledged by National Collegiate Cycling Association within USA Cycling. This includes road bicycle racing, Mountain bike racing and Cyclocross. The team won the Division 2, as established by USA Cycling, collegiate team mountain bike national championships in 2008. They won the Division 2 collegiate team cyclocross national championships in 2008 and 2009.[61] The team is now recognized as a Division 1 team.[by whom?]\\r\\nOn February 19, 2011, the Appalachian State Mountaineer Women's Basketball Team won the 2011 Southern Conference regular season title. The last time they had won the title was 1996. This is a first for Head Coach Darcie Vincent. On May 18, 2012, the Appalachian State Baseball team beat Western Carolina University, becoming Southern Conference baseball champions for the first time since 1985.[62]\\r\\nAppalachian won three consecutive Division I FCS (I-AA) national championships in 2005, 2006, and 2007, over the University of Northern Iowa, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Delaware, respectively. The Mountaineers are the first FCS football team to win three straight national championships since the playoffs began in 1978. They are also the first Division I program to win three consecutive national championships since Army accomplished the feat in 1944, 1945, and 1946.[63]\\r\\nIn a milestone for ASU athletics, on September 1, 2007, the Appalachian State football team played their season opener at the fifth-ranked University of Michigan in front of the largest crowd to ever witness an ASU football game. Appalachian State beat Michigan in the game that would become known as the \\"Alltime Upset\\" by Sports Illustrated with a final score of 34ÿ32 and became the first Division I FCS (I-AA) football team to defeat a Division I FBS (I-A) team ranked in the AP poll.[64]\\r\\nThe Hayes School of Music provides support for the Mountaineers at all home football games with the Marching Mountaineers, and at all home basketball games with the Appalachian Pep Band. The Marching Mountaineers travel to a select few away games each football season. The director of the Athletic Bands is Dr. Kevin Richardson. In addition to supporting the athletic department, the Marching Mountaineers have assisted the Rho Tau Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia in hosting the Appalachian Marching Band Festival annually.[65]\\r\\nIn 2004, a committee for the Appalachian Family Caravan tour created a promotional video titled \\"Hot Hot Hot\\", shown throughout the area by Chancellor Kenneth E. Peacock. The video became an inadvertent internet phenomenon and was featured on VH1's Web Junk 20 program in early 2006.[66] The video was never intended to promote Appalachian State to anyone but the Family Caravan, much less as a recruiting tool for prospective students. The video is no longer used by the university, due to student and alumni protests.\\r\\nIn 2002, MTV's program Road Rules visited ASU to produce an episode called Campus Crawl, aired on-campus during an annual, winter student swimming event called the \\"Polar Plunge\\".

A. Milne. The wood is visited regularly by the young boy Christopher Robin, who accompanies Pooh and company on their many adventures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn A. A. Milne's books, the term \\"Hundred Acre Wood\\" is actually used for a specific part of the larger Forest, centred on Owl's house. (See the map in the book, as well as numerous references in the text to the characters going \\"into\\" or \\"out of\\" the Hundred Acre Wood as they go between Owl's house and other Forest locations).  However, in the Pooh movies, and in general conversation with most Pooh fans, \\"The Hundred Acre Wood\\" is used for the entire world of Winnie-the-Pooh, the Forest and all the places it contains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hundred Acre Wood of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories is in actuality Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, England, where the Winnie-the-Pooh stories were set. A.A. Milne's country home at Cotchford Farm, Hartfield was situated just north of Ashdown Forest, and Five Hundred Acre Wood is a dense beech wood that Christopher Robin Milne would explore on his way from Cotchford Farm onto the Forest. Five Hundred Acre Wood is long-established, having been originally sold off from the Forest in 1678. The wood remains privately owned, being part of Buckhurst Park estate,[1] and is not therefore generally accessible to the public, though two footpaths which are public rights of way to do, one of which is part of a long-distance footpath, the Wealdway, cross through the wood and may be used by members of the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilne was inspired by the beautiful landscape of Ashdown Forest to use it as the setting for his Winnie-the-Pooh stories, and many features from the stories can be identified with specific locations in the forest. However, an American television episode \\"How Much Is The Rabbit In That Window?\\" suggests that the Hundred Acre Wood is relocated near a small city in the United States of America, due to the fact that a postal box has \\"U.S. Mail\\" written on it. The car park at the hilltop of Gills Lap, the (Galleon's Lap of the Pooh stories) in Ashdown Forest, (grid reference TQ 467 315), contains a display panel with a map of the surrounding area and the features from several of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories marked on it. For example, Five Hundred Acre Wood lies a short distance to the north-east, while the \\"Enchanted Place\\" is a small wooded area 200 metres (656 feet) to the north. A memorial plaque dedicated to A.A. Milne and his illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, lies 100 metres (328 feet) away.

It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.\\r\\nSince about 1900, the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc., which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.\\r\\nHoover Dam impounds Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States by volume (when it is full).[5] The dam is located near Boulder City, Nevada, a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project, about 30?mi (48?km) southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The dam's generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction; nearly a million people tour the dam each year. The heavily traveled U.S. Route 93 (US?93) ran along the dam's crest until October 2010, when the Hoover Dam Bypass opened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the United States developed the Southwest, the Colorado River was seen as a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley.[6] Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea,[7] the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3?million in 1906ÿ07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.[8]\\r\\nAs the technology of electric power transmission improved, the Lower Colorado was considered for its hydroelectric-power potential. In 1902, the Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles surveyed the river in the hope of building a 40-foot (12?m) rock dam which could generate 10,000 horsepower (7,500?kW). However, at the time, the limit of transmission of electric power was 80 miles (130?km), and there were few customers (mostly mines) within that limit. Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapseincluding an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam.[9]\\r\\nIn the following years, the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam. Service chief Arthur Powell Davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon,[10] 20 miles (32?km) north of the eventual dam site, into the river.[11] The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble. In 1922, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money.[10]\\r\\nIn 1922, the Reclamation Service presented a report calling for the development of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control and electric power generation. The report was principally authored by Davis, and was called the Fall-Davis report after Interior Secretary Albert Fall. The Fall-Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern, because the river's basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico.[12] Though the Fall-Davis report called for a dam \\"at or near Boulder Canyon\\", the Reclamation Service (which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year) found that canyon unsuitable.[13] One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a geologic fault; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon[13] or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site.[14] Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the \\"Boulder Canyon Project\\".[15]\\r\\nWith little guidance on water allocation from the Supreme Court, proponents of the dam feared endless litigation. A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an interstate compact, with the approval of Congress. Such compacts were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover.[16] Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.[17]\\r\\nLegislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by two California Republicans, Representative Phil Swing and Senator Hiram Johnson, but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California. The 1927 Mississippi flood made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 12, 1928, the failure of the St. Francis Dam, constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people. As that dam was a curved-gravity type,[18] similar in design to the arch-gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam's safety could not be guaranteed. Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam. The Colorado River Board found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea. The Board cautioned: \\"To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra-conservative lines.\\"[19]\\r\\nOn December 21, 1928 President Coolidge signed the bill authorizing the dam.[20] The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $165?million for the Hoover Dam along with the downstream Imperial Dam and All-American Canal, a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border.[21] It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.[22]\\r\\nEven before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used. Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete arch-gravity dam, the design of which was overseen by the Bureau's chief design engineer John L. Savage. The monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top, and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam. The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water's force into the abutments, in this case the rock walls of the canyon. The wedge-shaped dam would be 660?ft (200?m) thick at the bottom, narrowing to 45?ft (14?m) at the top, leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona.[23]\\r\\nOn January 10, 1931, the Bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy. The government was to provide the materials; but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100?pages of text and 76?drawings. A $2?million bid bond was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5?million performance bond. The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.[24]\\r\\nThe Wattis Brothers, heads of the Utah Construction Company, were interested in bidding on the project, but lacked the money for the performance bond. They lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners, Morrison-Knudsen, which employed the nation's leading dam builder, Frank Crowe. They formed a joint venture to bid for the project with Pacific Bridge Company of Portland, Oregon; Henry J. Kaiser & W. A. Bechtel Company of San Francisco; MacDonald & Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and the J.F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon.[25] The joint venture was called Six Companies, Inc. as Bechtel and Kaiser were considered one company for purposes of 6 in the name. The name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the San Franciscans in the bid, where \\"Six Companies\\" was also a Chinese benevolent association in the city.[26] There were three valid bids, and Six Companies' bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next-lowest bid.[27]\\r\\nThe city of Las Vegas had lobbied hard to be the headquarters for the dam construction, closing its many speakeasies when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior Ray Wilbur came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was to be built in the desert near the dam site. This town became known as Boulder City, Nevada. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.[28]\\r\\nSoon after the dam was authorized, increasing numbers of unemployed people converged on southern Nevada. Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it.[29] A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters' camp. Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families.[30] Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as \\"Ragtown\\".[31] When construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932[32] and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934.[33] \\"Mongolian\\" (Chinese) labor was prevented by the construction contract,[33] while the number of blacks employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.[34]\\r\\nAs part of the contract, Six Companies, Inc. was to build Boulder City to house the workers. The original timetable called for Boulder City to be built before the dam project began, but President Hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in March 1931 rather than in October.[35] The company built bunkhouses, attached to the canyon wall, to house 480?single men at what became known as River Camp. Workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until Boulder City could be completed,[36] and many lived in Ragtown.[37] The site of Hoover Dam endures extremely hot weather, and the summer of 1931 was especially torrid, with the daytime high averaging 119.9?F (48.8?C).[38] Sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of heat prostration between June 25 and July 26, 1931.[39]\\r\\nThe Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or \\"Wobblies\\"), though much-reduced from their heyday as militant labor organizers in the early years of the century, hoped to unionize the Six Companies workers by capitalizing on their discontent. They sent eleven organizers,[40] several of whom were arrested by Las Vegas police.[41] On August 7, 1931, the company cut wages for all tunnel workers. Although the workers sent away the organizers, not wanting to be associated with the \\"Wobblies\\", they formed a committee to represent them with the company. The committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to Crowe the following morning. He was noncommittal. The workers hoped that Crowe, the general superintendent of the job, would be sympathetic; instead he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper, describing the workers as \\"malcontents\\".[42]\\r\\nOn the morning of the 9th, Crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5?p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments.[43] Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off.[44] While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.[45]\\r\\nA second labor action took place in July 1935, as construction on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.[46]\\r\\nBefore the dam could be built, the Colorado River needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the Nevada side and two on the Arizona side. These tunnels were 56?ft (17?m) in diameter.[47] Their combined length was nearly 16,000?ft, or more than 3 miles (5?km).[48] The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October 1, 1933, with a $3,000-per-day fine to be assessed for any delay. To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early 1933, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert.[49]\\r\\nTunneling began at the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels in May 1931. Shortly afterward, work began on two similar tunnels in the Arizona canyon wall. In March 1932, work began on lining the tunnels with concrete. First the base, or invert, was poured. Gantry cranes, running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete. The sidewalls were poured next. Movable sections of steel forms were used for the sidewalls. Finally, using pneumatic guns, the overheads were filled in. The concrete lining is 3 feet (1?m) thick, reducing the finished tunnel diameter to 50?ft (15?m).[48] The river was diverted into the two Arizona tunnels on November 13, 1932; the Nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water. This was done by exploding a temporary cofferdam protecting the Arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked.[50]\\r\\nFollowing the completion of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels.[48] The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works.[47] The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.[47]\\r\\nTo protect the construction site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were constructed. Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river had not yet been diverted.[51] The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was 96?ft (29?m) high, and 750 feet (230?m) thick at its base, thicker than the dam itself. It contained 650,000 cubic yards (500,000?m3) of material.[52]\\r\\nWhen the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, it was necessary to remove accumulated erosion soils and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately 1,500,000?cu?yd (1,100,000?m3) of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage.[51]\\r\\nThe men who removed this rock were called \\"high scalers\\". While suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety.[53] One high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the \\"Human Pendulum\\" for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon.[54] To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called \\"hard boiled hats\\" (later \\"hard hats\\") and strongly encouraged their use.[55]\\r\\nThe cleared, underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a grout curtain. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as 150 feet (46?m) into the rock, and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit \\"uplift\\"upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled.[56] After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock.[57] It took nine years (1938ÿ47) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.[58]\\r\\nThe first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18?months ahead of schedule.[59] Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as 50?ft square (15?m) and 5 feet (1.5?m) high.[60] Each five-foot form contained a series of 1-inch (25?mm) steel pipes; cool riverwater would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a refrigeration plant. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase the strength of the joins.[61]\\r\\nThe concrete was delivered in huge steel buckets 7 feet high (2.1?m) and almost 7?feet in diameter; Crowe was awarded two patents for their design. These buckets, which weighed 20 short tons (18?t) when full, were filled at two massive concrete plants on the Nevada side, and were delivered to the site in special railcars. The buckets were then suspended from aerial cableways, which were used to deliver the bucket to a specific column. As the required grade of aggregate in the concrete differed depending on placement in the dam (from pea-sized gravel to 9-inch or 23?cm stones), it was vital that the bucket be maneuvered to the proper column. When the bottom of the bucket opened up, disgorging 8?cu?yd (6.1?m3) of concrete, a team of men worked it throughout the form. Although there are myths that men were caught in the pour and are entombed in the dam to this day, each bucket only deepened the concrete in a form by an inch, and Six Companies engineers would not have permitted a flaw caused by the presence of a human body.[62]\\r\\nA total of 3,250,000 cubic yards (2,480,000?m3) of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on May 29, 1935. In addition, 1,110,000?cu?yd (850,000?m3) were used in the power plant and other works. More than 582 miles (937?km) of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete. Overall, there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York.[47] Concrete cores were removed from the dam for testing in 1995; they showed that \\"Hoover Dam's concrete has continued to slowly gain strength\\" and the dam is composed of a \\"durable concrete having a compressive strength exceeding the range typically found in normal mass concrete\\".[63] Hoover Dam concrete is not subject to alkaliÿsilica reaction (ASR) as the Hoover Dam builders happened to use nonreactive aggregate, unlike that at downstream Parker Dam, where ASR has caused measurable deterioration.[63]\\r\\nWith most work finished on the dam itself (the powerhouse remained uncompleted), a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September 30, 1935, to coincide with a western tour being made by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from 2?p.m. Pacific time to 11?a.m.; this was done because Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes had reserved a radio slot for the President for 2?p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for 2?p.m. Eastern Time.[64] Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of 102?F (39?C), 10,000?people were present for the President's speech, in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover,[65] who was not invited to the ceremony.[66] To mark the occasion, a three-cent stamp was issued by the United States Post Office Departmentbearing the name \\"Boulder Dam\\", the official name of the dam between 1933 and 1947.[67] After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas.[65]\\r\\nMost work had been completed by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935, and early 1936, to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the Federal Government. The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam on behalf of the government. Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.[68]\\r\\nThere were 112?deaths associated with the construction of the dam.[70] The first was J. G. Tierney, a surveyor who drowned on December 20, 1922, while looking for an ideal spot for the dam.[70] The last death on the project's official fatality list occurred on December 20, 1935, when an \\"electrician's helper\\", Patrick Tierney, the son of J. G. Tierney, fell from an intake tower. Included in the fatality list are three workers, one in 1932 and two in 1933, who committed suicide onsite.[71][72][73] Ninety-six of the deaths occurred during construction at the site.[70] Of the 112?fatalities, 91 were Six Companies employees, three were BOR employees, and one was a visitor to the site, with the remainder employees of various contractors not part of Six Companies.[74]\\r\\nNot included in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on by the use of gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims.[75] The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached 140?F (60?C), enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases.[76] A total of 42?workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.[75]\\r\\nThe initial plans for the facade of the dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and ornaments clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors.[77] Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona? both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.[78]\\r\\nAt Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True[77] was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region.[79] Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist.[80] With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics.[81] The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals? lizards, serpents, birds? and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas.[79] In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.[82]\\r\\nWith the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers, True also devised an innovative color-coding for the pipes and machinery, which was implemented throughout all BOR projects.[83] True's consulting artist job lasted through 1942; it was extended so he could complete design work for the Parker, Shasta and Grand Coulee dams and power plants. True's work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in The New Yorker, part of which read, \\"lose the spark, and justify the dream; but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme\\".[84]\\r\\nComplementing Kaufmann and True's work, the Norwegian-born, naturalized American sculptor Oskar J.W. Hansen designed many of the sculptures on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the bas-reliefs on the elevator towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express \\"the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, and the enormous power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment\\", because \\"[t]he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring.\\"[69] Hansen's dedication plaza, on the Nevada abutment, contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole.\\r\\nSurrounding the base of the monument is a terrazzo floor embedded with a \\"star map\\". The map depicts the Northern Hemisphere sky at the moment of President Roosevelt's dedication of the dam. This is intended to help future astronomers, if necessary, calculate the exact date of dedication.[69][85] The 30-foot-high (9.1?m) bronze figures, dubbed \\"Winged Figures of the Republic\\", were each formed in a continuous pour. To put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface, they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted.[86] Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam: flood control, navigation, irrigation, water storage, and power. The bas-relief on the Arizona elevator depicts, in his words, \\"the visages of those Indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant.\\"[69]\\r\\nExcavation for the powerhouse was carried out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before the last of the concrete was poured that May.[87] The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30, 1935a crew of 500?men remained to finish it and other structures.[88] To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about 3.5 feet (1.1?m), topped with layers of sand and tar.[89]\\r\\nIn the latter half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis Chalmers built Francis turbine-generators, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time.[87][90] Original plans called for 16?large generators, eight on each side of the river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable.[2] The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.[91]\\r\\nBefore water from Lake Mead reaches the turbines, it enters the intake towers and then four gradually narrowing penstocks which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum hydraulic head (water pressure) of 590?ft (180?m) as the water reaches a speed of about 85?mph (140?km/h). The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and outlet works (jet-flow gates) are rarely used.[2] The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures 180 feet (55?m) above the river, and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance.[92] Following an uprating project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 megawatt Pelton turbine-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts.[2] The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956.[2] The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947ÿ2008.[2] In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.[93]\\r\\nThe amount of electricity generated by Hoover Dam has been decreasing along with the falling water level in Lake Mead due to the prolonged drought in the 2010s and high demand for the Colorado River's water. Lake Mead fell to a new record low elevation of 1,071.61 feet (326.63?m) on July 1, 2016 before beginning to rebound slowly.[94] Under its original design, the dam will no longer be able to generate power once the water level falls below 1,050 feet (320?m), which could occur as early as 2017. To lower the minimum power pool elevation from 1,050 to 950 feet (320 to 290?m), five wide-head turbines, designed to work efficiently with less flow, are being installed and will be fully online by 2017.[95] Due to the low water levels, by 2014 it was providing power only during periods of peak demand.[96]\\r\\nControl of water was the primary concern in the building of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.[91]\\r\\nLake Mead and downstream releases from the dam also provide water for both municipal and irrigation uses. Water released from the Hoover Dam eventually reaches several canals. The Colorado River Aqueduct and Central Arizona Project branch off Lake Havasu while the All-American Canal is supplied by the Imperial Dam. In total, water from the Lake Mead serves 18 million people in Arizona, Nevada and California and supplies the irrigation of over 1,000,000 acres (400,000?ha) of land.[91][97]\\r\\nElectricity from the dam's powerhouse was originally sold pursuant to a fifty-year contract, authorized by Congress in 1934, which ran from 1937 to 1987. In 1984, Congress passed a new statute which set power allocations from the dam from 1987 to 2017.[98] The powerhouse was run under the original authorization by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison; in 1987, the Bureau of Reclamation assumed control.[99] In 2011, Congress enacted legislation extending the current contracts until 2067, after setting aside 5% of Hoover Dam's power for sale to Native American tribes, electric cooperatives, and other entities. The new arrangement began on October 1, 2017.[98]\\r\\nThe Bureau of Reclamation reports that the energy generated under the contracts ending in 2017 was allocated as follows:[2]\\r\\nTourists gather around one of the generators in the Nevada wing of the powerhouse to hear its operation explained, September 1940\\r\\nA worker stands by the 30?ft (9.1?m) diameter Nevada penstock before its junction with another penstock that delivers water to a turbine\\r\\nThe dam is protected against over-topping by two spillways. The spillway entrances are located behind each dam abutment, running roughly parallel to the canyon walls. The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side-flow weir with each spillway containing four 100-foot-long (30?m) and 16-foot-wide (4.9?m) steel-drum gates. Each gate weighs 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000?kg) and can be operated manually or automatically. Gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions. The gates could not entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but could maintain an extra 16?ft (4.9?m) of lake level.[100] Water flowing over the spillways falls dramatically into 600-foot-long (180?m), 50-foot-wide (15?m) spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels, and reentering the main river channel below the dam. This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate 700-foot (210?m) elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges. Each spillway's capacity of 200,000?cu?ft/s (5,700?m3/s) was empirically verified in post-construction tests in 1941.[100]\\r\\nThe large spillway tunnels have only been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock.[101] The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and the surface of the concrete was polished mirror-smooth.[102] The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways.[101] Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.[102]\\r\\nThere are two lanes for automobile traffic across the top of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for U.S. Route 93.[103] In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, authorities expressed security concerns and the Hoover Dam Bypass project was expedited. Pending the completion of the bypass, restricted traffic was permitted over Hoover Dam. Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while semi-trailer trucks, buses carrying luggage, and enclosed-box trucks over 40?ft (12?m) long were not allowed on the dam at all, and were diverted to U.S. Route 95 or Nevada State Routes 163/68.[104] The four-lane Hoover Dam Bypass opened on October 19, 2010.[105] It includes a composite steel and concrete arch bridge, the Mike O'CallaghanÿPat Tillman Memorial Bridge, 1,500?ft (460?m) downstream from the dam. With the opening of the bypass, through traffic is no longer allowed across Hoover Dam; dam visitors are allowed to use the existing roadway to approach from the Nevada side and cross to parking lots and other facilities on the Arizona side.[106]\\r\\nHoover Dam opened for tours in 1937 after its completion, but following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, it was closed to the public when the United States entered World War II, during which only authorized traffic, in convoys, was permitted. After the war, it reopened September 2, 1945, and by 1953, annual attendance had risen to 448,081. The dam closed on November 25, 1963 and March 31, 1969, days of mourning in remembrance of Presidents Kennedy and Eisenhower. In 1995, a new visitors' center was built, and the following year, visits exceeded one million for the first time. The dam closed again to the public on September 11, 2001; modified tours were resumed in December and a new \\"Discovery Tour\\" was added the following year.[99] Today, nearly a million people per year take the tours of the dam offered by the Bureau of Reclamation.[107] Increased security concerns by the government have led to most of the interior structure being inaccessible to tourists. As a result, few of True's decorations can now be seen by visitors.[108]\\r\\nThe changes in water flow and use caused by Hoover Dam's construction and operation have had a large impact on the Colorado River Delta.[109] The construction of the dam has been implicated in causing the decline of this estuarine ecosystem.[109] For six years after the construction of the dam, while Lake Mead filled, virtually no water reached the mouth of the river.[110] The delta's estuary, which once had a freshwater-saltwater mixing zone stretching 40 miles (64?km) south of the river's mouth, was turned into an inverse estuary where the level of salinity was higher close to the river's mouth.[111]\\r\\nThe Colorado River had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals.[112] The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam.[113] Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the Bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and Razorback sucker, are listed as endangered.[114][115]\\r\\nDuring the years of lobbying leading up to the passage of legislation authorizing the dam in 1928, the press generally referred to the dam as \\"Boulder Dam\\" or as \\"Boulder Canyon Dam\\", even though the proposed site had shifted to Black Canyon.[15] The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 (BCPA) never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam. The BCPA merely allows the government to \\"construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon\\".[116]\\r\\nWhen Secretary Wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam \\"Hoover Dam\\", citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office. Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was \\"the great engineer whose vision and persistence?... has done so much to make [the dam] possible\\".[117] One writer complained in response that \\"the Great Engineer had quickly drained, ditched, and dammed the country.\\"[117]\\r\\nAfter Hoover's election defeat in 1932 and the accession of the Roosevelt administration, Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13, 1933, that the dam be referred to as \\"Boulder Dam\\". Ickes stated that Wilbur had been imprudent in naming the dam after a sitting president, that Congress had never ratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam.[117] Unknown to the general public, Attorney General Homer Cummings informed Ickes that Congress had indeed used the name \\"Hoover Dam\\" in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam.[118] The official status this conferred to the name \\"Hoover Dam\\" had been noted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman Edward T. Taylor of Colorado on December 12, 1930,[119] but was likewise ignored by Ickes.\\r\\nWhen Ickes spoke at the dedication ceremony on September 30, 1935, he was determined, as he recorded in his diary, \\"to try to nail down for good and all the name Boulder Dam.\\"[67] At one point in the speech, he spoke the words \\"Boulder Dam\\" five times within thirty seconds.[120] Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator Hiram Johnson, a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation.[67] Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam,[88] and the Republican-leaning Los Angeles Times, which at the time of Ickes' name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively chipping away at an enormous sign \\"HOOVER DAM,\\" reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success.[121]\\r\\nIn the following years, the name \\"Boulder Dam\\" failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names interchangeably and mapmakers divided as to which name should be printed. Memories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name \\"Hoover Dam.\\" Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, \\"I didn't know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with.\\"[122]\\r\\nHoover Dam was recognized as a National Civil Engineering Landmark in 1984.[123] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, cited for its engineering innovations.[4]\\r\\nOther sources","input":"What's the purpose of the hoover dam?"},{"output":"primarily compose adipose tissue","context":"Adipocytes, also known as lipocytes and fat cells, are the cells that primarily compose adipose tissue, specialized in storing energy as fat.[1] Adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells which give rise to adipocytes, osteoblasts, myocytes and other cell types.\\r\\nThere are two types of adipose tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which are also known as white fat and brown fat, respectively, and comprise two types of fat cells. Most recently, the presence of beige adipocytes with a gene expression pattern distinct from either white or brown adipocytes has been described.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite fat cells or monovacuolar cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a layer of cytoplasm. The nucleus is flattened and located on the periphery. A typical fat cell is 0.1?mm in diameter with some being twice that size and others half that size. The fat stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester. White fat cells secrete many proteins acting as adipokines such as resistin, adiponectin, leptin and apelin. An average human adult has 30 billion fat cells with a weight of 30?lbs or 13.5?kg. If excess weight is gained as an adult, fat cells increase in size about fourfold before dividing and increasing the absolute number of fat cells present.[2]\\r\\nBrown fat cells or plurivacuolar cells are polygonal in shape. Unlike white fat cells, these cells have considerable cytoplasm, with lipid droplets scattered throughout. The nucleus is round, and, although eccentrically located, it is not in the periphery of the cell. The brown color comes from the large quantity of mitochondria. Brown fat, also known as \\"baby fat,\\" is used to generate heat.\\r\\nMarrow adipocytes, like brown and white adipocytes, are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. The marrow adipose tissue depot is poorly understood in terms of its physiologic function and relevance to bone health. Marrow adipose tissue expands in states of low bone density but additionally expands in the setting of obesity;.[3] Interestingly, marrow adipose tissue response to exercise approximates that of WAT[3][4][5][6] exercise reduces both adipocyte size as well as MAT volume as quantified by MRI or CT imaging of bone stained with the lipid binder osmium.\\r\\nPre-adipocytes are undifferentiated fibroblasts that can be stimulated to form adipocytes. Recent studies shed light into potential molecular mechanisms in the fate determination of pre-adipocytes although the exact lineage of adipocyte is still unclear.[7][8] The variation of body fat distribution resulting from normal growth is influenced by nutritional and hormonal status in dependence on intrinsic differences in cells found in each adipose depot.[9]\\r\\nMesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into adipocytes, connective tissue, muscle or bone.[1]\\r\\nThe term \\"lipoblast\\" is used to describe the precursor of the adult cell. The term \\"lipoblastoma\\" is used to describe a tumor of this cell type.[10]\\r\\nEven after marked weight loss, the body never loses adipocytes.[citation needed]As a rule, to facilitate changes in weight, the adipocytes in the body merely gain or lose fat content. However, if the adipocytes in the body reach their maximum capacity of fat, they may replicate to allow additional fat storage.\\r\\nAdult rats of various strains became obese when they were fed a highly palatable diet for several months. Analysis of their adipose tissue morphology revealed increases in both adipocyte size and number in most depots. Reintroduction of an ordinary chow diet[clarification needed] to such animals precipitated a period of weight loss during which only mean adipocyte size returned to normal. Adipocyte number remained at the elevated level achieved during the period of weight gain.[11]\\r\\nIn some reports and textbooks, the number of adipocytes can increase in childhood and adolescence, though the amount is usually constant in adults. Interestingly, individuals who become obese as adults, rather than as adolescents, have no more adipocytes than they had before.[12]\\r\\nPeople who have been fat since childhood generally have an inflated number of fat cells. People who become fat as adults may have no more fat cells than their lean peers, but their fat cells are larger. In general, people with an excess of fat cells find it harder to lose weight and keep it off than the obese who simply have enlarged fat cells.[13]\\r\\nAccording to research by Tchoukalova et al., 2010, body fat cells could have regional responses to the overfeeding that was studied in adult subjects. In the upper body, an increase of adipocyte size correlated with upper-body fat gain; however, the number of fat cells was not significantly changed. In contrast to the upper body fat cell response, the number of lower-body adipocytes did significantly increase during the course of experiment. Notably, there was no change in the size of the lower-body adipocytes.[14]\\r\\nApproximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index without a significant increase in the overall number of adipocytes in adulthood.[12]\\r\\nObesity is characterized by the expansion of fat mass, through adipocyte size increase (hypertrophy) and, to a lesser extent, cell proliferation (hyperplasia).[15] In the fat cells of obese individuals, there is increased production of metabolism modulators, such as glycerol, hormones, macrophage stimulating chemokines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of insulin resistance.[16]\\r\\nFat production in adipocytes is strongly stimulated by insulin. By controlling the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzymes, insulin promotes unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. It also promotes glucose uptake and induces SREBF1, which activates the transcription of genes that stimulate lipogenesis.[17]\\r\\nSREBF1 (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor synthesized as an inactive precursor protein inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by two membrane-spanning helices. Also anchored in the ER membrane is SCAP (SREBF-cleavage activating protein), which binds SREBF1. The SREBF1-SCAP complex is retained in the ER membrane by INSIG1 (insulin-induced gene 1 protein). When sterol levels are depleted, INSIG1 releases SCAP and the SREBF1-SCAP complex can be sorted into COPII-coated transport vesicles that are exported to the Golgi. In the Golgi, SREBF1 is cleaved and released as a transcriptionally active mature protein. It is then free to translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of its target genes.\\r\\n[18]\\r\\nClinical studies have repeatedly shown that even though insulin resistance is usually associated with obesity, the membrane phospholipids of the adipocytes of obese patients generally still show an increased degree of fatty acid unsaturation.[19] This seems to point to an adaptive mechanism that allows the adipocyte to maintain its functionality, despite the increased storage demands associated with obesity and insulin resistance.\\r\\nA study conducted in 2013[19] found that, while INSIG1 and SREBF1 mRNA expression was decreased in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, the amount of active SREBF1 was increased in comparison with normal mice and non-obese patients. This downregulation of INSIG1 expression combined with the increase of mature SREBF1 was also correlated with the maintenance of SREBF1-target gene expression. Hence, it appears that, by downregulating INSIG1, there is a resetting of the INSIG1/SREBF1 loop, allowing for the maintenance of active SREBF1 levels. This seems to help compensate for the anti-lipogenic effects of insulin resistance and thus preserve adipocyte fat storage abilities and availability of appropriate levels of fatty acid unsaturation in face of the nutritional pressures of obesity.\\r\\nAdipocytes can synthesize estrogens from androgens,[20] potentially being the reason why being underweight or overweight are risk factors for infertility.[21] Additionally, adipocytes are responsible for the production of the hormone leptin. Leptin is important in regulation of appetite and acts as a satiety factor.[22]","input":"What do fat cells do for the body?"},{"output":"to enhance the quality of life within the community","context":"????

Originating around 1789 as a small trading community inhabited by the Neutral Nation near the mouth of Buffalo Creek, the city, then a town, grew quickly after the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, with the city at its western terminus. Its position at the eastern end of Lake Erie strengthened the economy, based on grain milling and steel production along the southern shores and in nearby Lackawanna.\\r\\nIn the dawn of the 20th century, Buffalo was one of the most populous cities in the United States. It had hosted the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 and later became a center for the automotive industry.\\r\\nLater, the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway combined with the effects of suburbanization, deindustrialization, and globalization led to the decline of the city's chief industries. The city lost over half of its population from the time period of 1950 to 2010. Buffalo retains many industries and has developed a diverse economy based upon advanced manufacturing, healthcare and education.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe City of Buffalo, formerly known as Buffalo Creek, received its name from the creek that flows through it. However, the origin of the creek's name is unclear, with several unproven theories existing. Early French explorers reported the abundance of buffalo on the Eastern shore of Lake Erie, but their presence on the banks of Buffalo Creek is still a matter of debate, although American Bison did range into western NY state at one time. Neither the Native American name Teyohoseroron (the Place of the Basswoods) nor the French name Riviere aux Chevaux (River of Horses) survived, so the current name likely dates to the British occupation which began with the capture of Fort Niagara in 1759.\\r\\nAnother theory holds that a Seneca Indian lived there, either whose name meant buffalo, or who had the physical characteristics of a buffalo, and was translated as such by the English settlers. The stream where he lived became Buffalo's Creek. Unlike other nearby creeks such as Scajaquada Creek and Smoke's Creek which were named after actual historic figures, there is no known reference to any Native American named Buffalo. Also given credence by local historians at one time was the possibility that an interpreter mistranslated the Native American word for \\"beaver\\" as \\"buffalo,\\" the words being very similar, at a treaty-signing at present-day Rome, New York in 1784. The theory assumes that because there were beaver here, the creek was probably called Beaver Creek rather than Buffalo Creek.\\r\\nAnother theory holds that the name is an anglicized form of the French name Beau Fleuve (beautiful river), which was supposedly an exclamation uttered by Louis Hennepin when he first saw the Niagara River. This is a relatively recently proposed theory (1909) and is unlikely, as no period sources contain this quote. The earliest known name origin theory is an anecdote told to Captain Daniel Dobbins by Cornelius Winney in 1795 and also found with variations in Sheldon Ball's History of Buffalo (1825) and other sources, about a party of hunters whose guide shoots a horse and passes it off as bison meat, thereafter the origin of the term \\"buffaloed.\\"\\r\\nDespite many years of speculation and garbling of previous debate, more recently available sources indicate that the name Buffalo Creek was in common use on the Niagara Frontier by 1764, as John Montresor referenced 'Buffalo Creek' in his journal of that year.[3] The name may have originated with an English speaking person sometime between 1759 and 1764, possibly after seeing animal bones, thought to be bison but possibly elk or moose or domesticated cattle, at the salt lick called Sour Springs located at the head of navigation about 6 miles up the creek.\\r\\nThe societies of the Native Forest dwellers we know as Native Americans, Amerindians, or First Nations made highways of the Great Lakes, streams and were far more social than their reputed penchant for warfare, cruelty, and collecting scalps would suggest. Their canoes were built from lightweight birch bark, or far more often, Elm, the farther south the tribe, the more likely Elm was the material used for many purposes including the canoes. Buffalo, near the throat of the Niagara River, was a popular campsite for voyaging tribesmen, in a culture which often went on walk-abouts, touring neighboring lands and conducting the widespread practice of boy-meets-girl, trading of regional commodities.[a]\\r\\nPrior to European colonization by French settlers, the region's inhabitants were an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot called the Wenro people or 'Wenrohronon', who lived along the south shore of Lake Ontario and east end of Lake Erie and a bit of its southern shore. The population of the Wenro was small by comparison to other Iroquoian tribes the French encountered and reported upon, possibly because they'd only recently split off from other groups or because they'd suffered the misfortunes of war. They were possibly (most likely) a sub-group of the main Neutral Confederacy which had colonized the opposite shore, or possibly relatives of the great abutting neighboring Erie Nation,[b] which extended southwesterly through most of present-day Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\\r\\nThe American Heritage Book of Indians points out there are opposing (on the surface) contradictory theories[c] of the origination and the migration of the Iroquois and Iroquoian peoples that came to inhabit the region around Buffalo and the Niagara River.[d]\\r\\nThe French found the Neutral groups helpful in mediating disputes with other tribesin particular the League of the Iroquois which became sworn enemies of the French from their first meeting in 1609.[e] By comparison, the Huron also an Iroquoian people, were often at odds with the Iroquois once European traders offered highly desired goods for furs, especially water proof Beaver pelts[f] About 1651 the Iroquois Confederacy declared war on the Neutrals; by 1653, the Confederacy, particularly the Senecas, had practically annihilated the Neutrals[4][5] and the splinter tribe of Wenro people. The Wenro's area was subsequently populated by the Seneca tribe.\\r\\nAlso in 1653 the large and populous Erie tribe, having taken in survivors of the Huron, Neutral, Wenro, and Tabacco peoplesIroquoian peoples one and all, with traditions of adopting outsidersreceived demands to send Neutrals to the Iroquois and instead launched an preemptive attack on the League, kicking off three years of desperate warfare that eventually shattered the Erie and bled the Iroquois of much of their strength.[g] Ohio and Western Pennsylvania became nearly vacant Iroquois hunting grounds, exploited for furs, but ten years later the Iroquois, having also adopted tribal members of peoples they'd recently thrashed, found themselves in a new war with the Susquehannocks who lived down below the Allegheny Front, the escarpment above most of today's central Pennsylvania along the Susquehanna River valleysanother people believed to have significantly outnumbered the Iroquois[h] so warring along the Susquehanna Valley from lower New York to Maryland through central Pennsylvania. In 1667-68 the Susquehannocks nearly wiped out two of the Five Iroquois people. At that point the Susquehannock's suffered one or more horrendous plagues, losing up to 90% of their population and military capabilities, and by 1672 the Iroquois became the proverbial 'Last Man Standing' in the Northern Beaver Wars.\\r\\nMost of western New York was granted by Charles II of England to the Duke of York (later King James II & VII), but the first European settlement in what is now Erie County was by the French, at the mouth of Buffalo Creek in 1758. Its buildings were destroyed a year later by the evacuating French after the British captured Fort Niagara. The British took control of the entire region in 1763, at the conclusion of the French and Indian War. In 1764, British military engineer John Montresor made an inspection tour of Buffalo Creek before determining on a site for a fortification on the opposite shore. After the 1779 Sullivan Expedition, the British settled Seneca refugees in several villages on Buffalo Creek in the spring of 1780.\\r\\nThe first permanent settlers in present-day Buffalo were Cornelius Winney and \\"Black Joe\\" Hodges, who set up a log cabin store there in 1789 for trading with the Native American community. British interpreter William Johnston was another early settler. The British retained control of the area and prevented further settlement by Americans until their evacuation of Fort Niagara in 1796.\\r\\nDutch investors purchased the area from the Seneca Indians as part of the Holland Purchase. Although other Senecas were involved in ceding their land, the most famous today is Red Jacket, who died in Buffalo in 1830. His grave is in Forest Lawn Cemetery. Starting in 1801, parcels were sold through the Holland Land Companies office in Batavia, New York. The settlement was initially called Lake Erie, then Buffalo Creek, soon shortened to Buffalo. Holland Land Company agent Joseph Ellicott christened it New Amsterdam, but the name did not catch on.[6] In 1808, Niagara County was established with Buffalo as its county seat. Erie County was formed out of Niagara County in 1821, retaining Buffalo as the county seat.\\r\\nIn 1804, Joseph Ellicott, a principal agent of the Holland Land Company, designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown like bicycle spokes, and is one of only three radial street patterns in the US[citation needed]. In 1810, the Town of Buffalo was formed from the western part of the Town of Clarence. On December 30, 1813, during the War of 1812, British troops and their Native American allies first captured the village of Black Rock, and then the rest of Buffalo, burning most of both to the ground. Buffalo gradually rebuilt itself and by 1816 had a new courthouse. In 1818, the eastern part of the town was lost to form the Town of Amherst.\\r\\nUpon the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Buffalo became the western end of the 524-mile waterway starting at New York City. At the time, Buffalo had a population of about 2,400 people. With the increased commerce of the canal, the population boomed and Buffalo was incorporated as a city in 1832.[7] On 1 June 1843, the world's first steam-powered grain elevator was put into service by a local merchant, Joseph Dart, Jr., and an engineer, Robert Dunbar. The \\"Dart Elevator\\" would remain standing until 1862, when it burned down. During the 1840s and 1850s, more than a dozen grain elevators were built in Buffalo's harbor, most of them designed by Dunbar.[8]\\r\\nIn 1853, Buffalo annexed Black Rock, which had been Buffalo's fierce rival for the canal terminus. During the 19th century, thousands of pioneers going to the western United States debarked from canal boats to continue their journey out of Buffalo by lake or rail transport. During their stopover, many experienced the pleasures and dangers of Buffalo's notorious Canal district.\\r\\nBuffalo was a terminus of the Underground Railroad, an informal series of safe houses for African-Americans escaping slavery in the mid-19th century. Buffalonians helped many fugitives cross the Niagara River to Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada and freedom.\\r\\nSeveral U.S. presidents have had connections with Buffalo.\\r\\nAround the start of the 20th century, Buffalo was a growing city with a burgeoning economy. Immigrants came from Ireland, Italy, Germany, and Poland to work in the steel and grain mills which had taken advantage of the city's critical location at the junction of the Great Lakes and the Erie Canal. Hydroelectric power harnessed from nearby Niagara Falls made Buffalo the first American city to have widespread electric lighting yielding it the nickname, the \\"City of Light\\". Electricity was used to dramatic effect at the Pan-American Exposition in 1901. The Pan-American was also notable for being the scene of the aforementioned assassination of President William McKinley.\\r\\nThe opening of the Peace Bridge linking Buffalo with Fort Erie, Ontario on August 7, 1927 was an occasion for significant celebrations.\\r\\nThe Great Depression of 1929-39 saw severe unemployment, especially among working class men. The New Deal relief programs operated full force. The city became a stronghold of labor unions and the Democratic Party.[9] Buffalo's City Hall, an Art Deco masterpiece, was dedicated on July 1, 1932.\\r\\nThe city's importance declined in the later half of the 20th century for several reasons, perhaps the most devastating being the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1957. Goods which had previously passed through Buffalo could now bypass it using a series of canals and locks, reaching the ocean via the St. Lawrence River. Another major toll was suburban migration, a national trend at the time. Race riots rocked the city in 1967.[10] The city, which boasted over half a million people at its peak, has seen its population decline by some 50%, as industries shut down and people left the Rust Belt for the employment opportunities of the South and West. Erie County has lost population in every census year since 1970.\\r\\nOn July 3, 2003, at the climax of a fiscal crisis, the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority was established[11] to oversee the finances of the city. As a \\"hard control board,\\" they have frozen the wages of city employees and must approve or reject all major expenditures. After a period of severe financial stress, Erie County, where Buffalo resides, was assigned a Fiscal Stability Authority on July 12, 2005. As a \\"soft control board,\\" however, they act only in an advisory capacity.[12] Both Authorities were established by New York State. In November 2005, Byron Brown was elected Mayor of Buffalo. He is the first African-American to hold this office.\\r\\nEconomic development in the city was marked at $3.5 billion in 2006 compared to the ten year previous average of $50 million[citation needed]. New proposals and renovations were numerous, especially in the downtown area. Buffalo ranked 83rd on the Forbes best cities for jobs list, an increase from the previous year, beating out cities like New York City, Cleveland, and Detroit.","input":"Where did buffalo new york get its name?"},{"output":"When the Republicans came to power in the Southern states after 1867","context":"","input":"When did the us public school system start?"},{"output":"Ajman","context":"","input":"What are the countries of the united arab emirates?"},{"output":"Leon High School","context":"Leon High School in 2008\\r\\n\\r\\nLeon High School is a public high school in Tallahassee, Florida, United States.

E. B. Du Bois, with Bishop Alexander Walters of the AME Zion Church taking the chair.[7] Du Bois played a leading role, drafting a letter (\\"Address to the Nations of the World\\")[8] to European leaders appealing to them to struggle against racism, to grant colonies in Africa and the West Indies the right to self-government and demanding political and other rights for African Americans.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 September 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams had been instrumental in founding the African Association (not to be confused with the Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa), in response to the European partition of Africa that followed the 1884-5 Congress of Berlin. The formation of the association marked an early stage in the development of the anti-colonialist movement, and was established to encourage the unity of Africans and people of African descent, particularly in territories of the British empire,[9] concerning itself with injustices in Britain's African and Caribbean colonies.[10] In March 1898 the association issued a circular calling for a pan-African conference. Booker T. Washington, who had been travelling in the UK in the summer of 1899, wrote in a letter to African-American newspapers:\\r\\n\\"In connection with the assembling of so many Negroes in London from different parts of the world, a very important movement has just been put upon foot. It is known as the Pan-African Conference. Representatives from Africa, the West Indian Islands and other parts of the world, asked me to meet them a few days ago with a view to making a preliminary program for this conference, and we had a most interesting meeting. It is surprising to see the strong intellectual mould which many of these Africans and West Indians possess. The object and character of the Pan-African Conference is best told in the words of the resolution, which was adopted at the meeting referred to, viz: 'In view of the widespread ignorance which is prevalent in England about the treatment of native races under European and American rule, the African Association, which consists of members of the race resident in England and which has been in existence for nearly two years, have resolved during the Paris Exposition of 1900 (which many representatives of the race may be visiting) to hold a conference in London in the month of May of the said year, in order to take steps to influence public opinion on existing proceedings and conditions affecting the welfare of the natives in various parts of Africa, the West Indies and the United States.' The resolution is signed by Mr H. Mason Joseph, President, and Mr H. Sylvester Williams as Honourable Secretary. The Honourable Secretary will be pleased to hear from representative natives who are desirous of attending at an early date. He may be addressed, Common Room, Grey's (sic) Inn, London, W.C.\\"[11]\\r\\nWhen the First Pan-African Conference opened on Monday, 23 July 1900, in London's Westminster Hall, Bishop Alexander Walters in his opening address, \\"The Trials and Tribulations of the Coloured Race in America\\", noted that \\"for the first time in history black people had gathered from all parts of the globe to discuss and improve the condition of their race, to assert their rights and organize so that they might take an equal place among nations.\\"[12] The Bishop of London, Mandell Creighton, gave a speech of welcome \\"referring to 'the benefits of self-government' which Britain must confer on 'other races ... as soon as possible'.\\"[12]\\r\\nSpeakers over the three days addressed a variety of aspects of racial discrimination. Among the papers delivered were: \\"Conditions Favouring a High Standard of African Humanity\\" (C. W. French of St. Kitts), \\"The Preservation of Racial Equality\\" (Anna H. Jones, from Kansas City, Missouri), \\"The Necessary Concord to be Established between Native Races and European Colonists\\" (Benito Sylvain,[13] Haitian aide-de-camp to the Ethiopian emperor), \\"The Negro Problem in America\\" (Anna J. Cooper, from Washington), \\"The Progress of our People\\" (John E. Quinlan of St. Lucia) and \\"Africa, the Sphinx of History, in the Light of Unsolved Problems\\" (D. E. Tobias from the USA).[14] Other topics included Richard Phipps' complaint of discrimination against black people in the Trinidadian civil service and an attack by William Meyer, a medical student at Edinburgh University, on pseudo-scientific racism. Discussions followed the presentation of the papers, and on the last day George James Christian, a law student from Dominica,[15][16] led a discussion on the subject \\"Organized Plunder and Human Progress Have Made Our Race Their Battlefield\\", saying that in the past \\"Africans had been kidnapped from their land, and in South Africa and Rhodesia slavery was being revived in the form of forced labour.\\"[17][18]\\r\\nThe conference culminated in the conversion of the African Association (formed by Sylvester Williams in 1897) into the Pan-African Association,[1] and the implementation of a unanimously adopted \\"Address to the Nations of the World\\", sent to various heads of state where people of African descent were living and suffering oppression.[19] The address implored the United States and the imperial European nations to acknowledge and protect the rights of people of African descent and to respect the integrity and independence of \\"the free Negro States of Abyssinia, Liberia, Haiti, etc.\\"[20] Signed by Walters (President of the Pan-African Association), the Canadian Rev. Henry B. Brown (Vice-President), Williams (General Secretary) and Du Bois (Chairman of the Committee on the Address),[21] the document contained the phrase \\"The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the colour-line\\", which Du Bois would use three years later in the \\"Forethought\\" of his book The Souls of Black Folk.[22]\\r\\nIn September, the delegates petitioned Queen Victoria through the British government to look into the treatment of Africans in South Africa and Rhodesia, including specified acts of injustice perpetrated by whites there, namely:\\r\\nThe response eventually received by Sylvester-Williams on 17 January 1901 stated:\\r\\n\\"Sir. I am directed by Mr Secretary Chamberlain to state that he has received the Queen's commands to inform you that the Memorial of the Pan-African Conference requesting the situation of the native races in South Africa, has been laid before Her Majesty, and that she was graciously pleased to command him to return an answer to it on behalf of her government.\\r\\n2. Mr. Chamberlain accordingly desires to assure the members of the Pan-African Conference that, it settling the lines on which the administration of the conquered territories is to be conducted, Her Majesty's Government will not overlook the interests and welfare of the native races.[23]\\r\\nDays later, Victoria responded more personally, instructing her private secretary, Arthur Bigge, to write, which he did on 21 January - the day before the Queen died.[24] Although the specific injustices in South Africa continued for some time, the conference brought them to the attention of the world.[25]\\r\\nThe conference was reported in major British newspapers, including The Times[1][26] and the Westminster Gazette,[19] which commented that it \\"marks the initiation of a remarkable movement in history: the negro is at last awake to the potentialities of his future\\" and quoted Williams as saying: \\"Our object now is to secure throughout the world the same facilities and privileges for the black as the white man enjoys.\\"[27]\\r\\nDuBois recorded in his report,\\r\\n\\"On Monday, the 23d of July, the conference was invited to a five o'clock tea given by the Reform Cobden Club of London in honor of the delegates, at its headquarters in the St. Ermin Hotel, one of the most elegant in the city.

After a magnificent repast had been served we were conducted through the extensive grounds which surround the palace....\\r\\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Clark, a member of Parliament, we were invited to tea on Wednesday, at 5 o'clock, on the Terrace of Parliament. After the tea the male members of our party were admitted to the House of Commons, which is considered quite an honor; indeed, the visit to the House of Parliament and tea on the Terrace was the crowning honor of the series. Great credit is due our genial secretary, Mr. H. Sylvester Williams, for these social functions.\\r\\nMiss Catherine Impey, of London, said she was glad to come in contact with the class of Negroes that composed the Pan-African Conference, and wished that the best and most cultured would visit England and meet her citizens of noble birth, that the adverse opinion which had been created against them in some quarters of late by their enemies might be changed.\\"[8]\\r\\nAfter the conference ended, Williams set up branches of the Pan-African Association in Jamaica, Trinidad and the USA. He also launched a short-lived journal, The Pan-African, in October 1901.[27] Although plans for the association to meet every two years failed, the 1900 conference encouraged the development of the Pan-African Congress.[28]\\r\\nAs Tony Martin noted, \\"At least three of the Caribbean delegates later emigrated to Africa. George Christian of Dominica became a successful lawyer and legislator in the Gold Coast (Ghana) where he was a member of the Legislative Council from 1920 to 1940. Richard E. Phipps, the Trinidad barrister, returned home after the conference and emigrated to the Gold Coast in 1911. He remained there until his death around 1926.

On the islands of Aruba, Cura?ao and Bonaire, a Spanish-Portuguese based creole known as Papiamento is predominant, while in Sint Maarten, Saba and Sint Eustatius, English, as well as a local English creole, are spoken. A Dutch creole known as Negerhollands was spoken in the former Danish West Indian islands of Saint Thomas and Saint John, but is now extinct. Its last native speaker died in 1987.[5]\\r\\nCaribbean Hindustani is a form of the Bhojpuri dialect of Hindustani spoken by descendants of the indentured laborers from India in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, and other parts of the Caribbean. [6]\\r\\nSeveral languages spoken in the Caribbean belong to language groups concentrated or originating in the mainland countries bordering on the Caribbean: Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Peru.\\r\\nMany indigenous languages (actually spoken with the mainland Caribbean rather than the islands) have been added to the list of endangered or extinct languagesfor example, Arawak languages (Shebayo, Ig?eri, Lokono, Garifuna of St. Vincent, and the one now labeled Tano by scholars, once spoken in the Greater Antilles), Caribbean (Nepuyo and Yao), Taruma, Atorada, Warrau, Arecuna, Akawaio and Patamona. Some of these languages are still spoken there by a few people.[7][8]\\r\\nCreoles are contact languages usually spoken in rather isolated colonies, the vocabulary of which is mainly taken from a European language (the lexifier).[9] Creoles generally have no initial or final consonant clusters but have a simple syllable structure which consists of alternating consonants and vowels (e.g. \\"CVCV\\").[10]\\r\\nA substantial proportion of the world's creole languages are to be found in the Caribbean and Africa, due partly to their multilingualism and their colonial past. The lexifiers of most of the Caribbean creoles and patois are languages of Indo-European colonizers of era. Creole languages continue to evolve in the direction of European colonial languages to which they are related, so that decreolization occurs and a post-creole continuum arises. For example, the Jamaican sociolinguistic situation has often been described in terms of this continuum.[11] Papiamento, spoken on the so-called 'ABC' islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Cura?ao), shows traces of both indigenous languages and Spanish,[12] Portuguese, and Dutch lexicons.).\\r\\nIn Jamaica , though generally English speaking island, a patois, often called \\"patois/patwa\\" drawing on a multitude of influences including Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, Arawak and African languages as well as Irish. In Barbados, a dialect often known as \\"bajan\\" have influences from West Africa languages can be heard on a regular day basis.\\r\\nContact between French- and English-lexified creoles is fairly common in the Lesser Antilles (apart from Saint Lucia), and can also be observed on Dominica, Saint Vincent, Carriacou, Petite Martinique and Grenada.[13]\\r\\nAsian languages such as Chinese and other Indian languages such as Tamil are spoken by Asian expatriates and their descendents exclusively. In earlier historical times, other Indo-European languages, such as German,[14] could be found in northeastern parts of the Caribbean.\\r\\nThroughout the long multilingual history of the Caribbean continent, Caribbean languages have been subject to phenomena like language contact, language expansion, language shift, and language death.[15] Two examples are the Spanish expansion, in which Spanish-speaking peoples expanded over most of central Caribbean, thereby displacing Arawak speaking peoples in much of the Caribbean, and the Creole expansion, in which Creole-speaking peoples expanded over several of islands. Another example is the English expansion in the 17th century, which led to the extension of English to much of the north and east Caribbean.\\r\\nTrade languages are another age-old phenomenon in the Caribbean linguistic landscape. Cultural and linguistic innovations that spread along trade routes, and languages of peoples dominant in trade, developed into languages of wider communication (linguae francae). Of particular importance in this respect are French (in the central and east Caribbean) and Dutch (in the south and east Caribbean).\\r\\nAfter gaining independence, many Caribbean countries, in the search for national unity, selected one language (generally the former colonial language) to be used in government and education. In recent years, Caribbean countries have become increasingly convinced of the importance of linguistic diversity. Language policies that are being developed nowadays are mostly aimed at multilingualism.[16]\\r\\nOf the 38 million West Indians (as of 2001),[17] about 62% speak Spanish (a west Caribbean lingua franca). About 25% speak French, about 15% speak English, and only 0.7% speak Dutch. Spanish, English, and French are important languages: 24 million, 9 million, and 5 million speak them as second languages.\\r\\nThe following is a list of major Caribbean languages (by total number of speakers)[needs updating]:\\r\\nSome linguistic features are particularly common among languages spoken in the Caribbean, whereas others seem less common. Such shared traits probably are not due to a common origin of all Caribbean languages. Instead, some may be due to language contact (resulting in borrowing) and specific idioms and phrases may be due to a similar cultural background.\\r\\nWidespread syntactical structures include the common use of adjectival verbs for e.g.:\\" He dirty the floor. The use of juxtaposition to show possession as in English Creole, \\"John book\\" instead of Standard English, \\"John's book\\", the omission of the copula in structures such as \\"he sick\\" and \\"the boy reading\\". In Standard English, these examples would be rendered, 'he seems/appears/is sick' and \\"the boy is reading\\".\\r\\nQuite often, only one term is used for both animal and meat; the word nama or nyama for animal/meat is particularly widespread in otherwise widely divergent Caribbean languages.","input":"What are the languages spoken in the bahamas?"},{"output":"both public and private","context":"Healthcare in China consists of both public and private medical institutions and insurance programs. About 95% of the population has at least basic health insurance coverage. Despite this, public health insurance generally only covers about half of medical costs, with the proportion lower for serious or chronic illnesses. Under the \\"Healthy China 2020\\" initiative, China is currently undertaking an effort to cut healthcare costs, and the government requires that insurance will cover 70% of costs by 2017.[1][2][2] The Chinese government is working on providing affordable basic healthcare to all residents by 2020.[3] China has also become a major market for health-related multinational companies. Companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, and Merck entered the Chinese market and have experienced explosive growth. China has also become a growing hub for health care research and development.[4]\\r\\nThe above applies to Mainland China. Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau maintain their own separate universal healthcare systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced for years, and served as the basis for health care in China for much of its history. Western-inspired evidence-based medicine made its way to China beginning in the 19th Century. When the Communist Party took over in 1949, health care was nationalized, a national \\"patriotic health campaign\\" attempted to address basic health and hygiene education, and basic primary care was dispatched to rural areas through barefoot doctors and other state-sponsored programs. Urban health care was also streamlined. However, beginning with economic reforms in 1978, health standards in China began to diverge significantly between urban and rural areas, and also between coastal and interior provinces. Much of the health sector became privatized. As state-owned enterprises shut down and the vast majority of urban residents were no longer employed by the state, they also lost much of the social security and health benefits. As a result, the majority of urban residents paid almost all health costs out-of-pocket beginning in the 1990s, and most rural residents simply could not afford to pay for health care in urban hospitalities.\\r\\nSince 2006, China has been undertaking the most significant health care reforms since the Mao era. The government launched the New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) in 2005 in an overhaul of the healthcare system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, some 800 million rural residents gained basic, tiered medical coverage, with the central and provincial governments covering between 30-80% of regular medical expenses.[5] Availability of medical insurance has increased in urban areas as well. By 2011 more than 95% of the total population of China had basic health insurance, though out-of-pocket costs and the quality of care varied significantly.[4] The health infrastructure in Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities were approaching developed-world standards, and are vastly superior compared to those operated in the rural interior.\\r\\nAll major cities have hospitals specializing in different fields, and are equipped with some modern facilities. Residents of urban areas are not provided with free healthcare, and must either pay for treatment or purchase health insurance. The quality of hospitals varies. The best medical care in China is available in foreign-run or joint venture Western-style medical facilities with international staff available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and a few other large cities. They are highly expensive; treatment there can often cost up to ten times more than a public hospital.[6] Public hospitals and clinics are available in all Chinese cities. Their quality varies by location; the best treatment can usually be found in public city-level hospitals, followed by smaller district-level clinics. Many public hospitals in major cities have so-called V.I.P. wards or gaogan bingfang. These feature reasonably up-to-date medical technology and skilled staff. Most V.I.P. wards also provide medical services to foreigners and have English-speaking doctors and nurses. V.I.P. wards typically charge higher prices than other hospital facilities, but are still often cheap by Western standards. In addition to medical facilities providing modern care, traditional Chinese medicine is also widely used, and there are Chinese medicine hospitals and treatment facilities located throughout the country. Dental care, cosmetic surgery, and other health-related services at Western standards are widely available in urban areas, though costs vary.\\r\\nHistorically, in rural areas, most healthcare was available in clinics providing rudimentary care, with poorly trained medical personnel and little medical equipment or medications, though certain rural areas had far higher-quality medical care than others. However, the quality of rural health services has improved dramatically since 2009. In an increasing trend, healthcare for residents of rural areas unable to travel long distances to reach an urban hospital is provided by family doctors who travel to the homes of patients, which is covered by the government.[7][8][9][10][11]\\r\\nReform of the health delivery system in urban areas of China has prompted concerns about the demand and utilization of Community Health Services Centres (CHC); a recent study, however, found that insured patients are less likely to use private clinics and more likely to use CHC.[12]\\r\\nDespite the introduction of western style medical facilities and the implementation of a National Essential Drug Policy,[13] the PRC has several emerging public health problems, which include problems as a result of pollution, a progressing HIV-AIDS epidemic, hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers,[14][15] and the increase in obesity among the population.[16][17] The HIV epidemic, in addition to the usual routes of infection, was exacerbated in the past by unsanitary practices used in the collection of blood in rural areas.[18] The problem with tobacco is complicated by the concentration of most cigarette sales in a government controlled monopoly.[15] The government, dependent on tobacco revenue, seems hesitant in its response and may even encourage it as seen from government websites.[19] Hepatitis B infection is widespread in mainland China, with about 10% of the population contracting the disease.[20] Some hepatitis researchers link hepatitis infections to a lower ratio of female births. If this link is confirmed, this would partially explain China's gender imbalance.[21] A program initiated in 2002 will attempt over the next 5 years to vaccinate all newborns in mainland China.[22]\\r\\nStrains of avian flu outbreaks in recent years among local poultry and birds, along with a number of its citizens, have caused great concern for China and other countries. While the virus is currently mainly animal-human transmissible (with only two well documented cases of human-human have been to the present known of to scientists), experts expect an avian flu pandemic that would affect the region should the virus morph to be human-human transmissible.[23]\\r\\nA more recent outbreak is the pig-human transmission of the Streptococcus suis bacteria in 2005, which has led to 38 deaths in and around Sichuan province, an unusually high number. Although the bacteria exists in other pig rearing countries, the pig-human transmission has only been reported in China.[24]\\r\\nAs of 2004, in more undeveloped areas it is advised to only drink bottled water as cholera, among other diseases, is spread through the water supply. As of 2012, food and water safety remains an issue.\\r\\nAnother major problem are the \\"black ambulances\\", or illegal, privately run, for-profit ambulance services. As there is a shortage of ambulances belonging to hospitals in major cities, many private businessmen are now operating fleets of unauthorized ambulances, often staffed by untrained personnel and with no medical equipment, and charging the patients. Despite a government crackdown, the number of private ambulances is growing.[25]\\r\\nUnaffordable medications are another gaping hole in the Chinese safety net. This forces workers to save as much as possible in order to weather family medical emergencies, which acts to depress domestic consumption, leaving no alternative to the traditional unsustainable export and investment driven economic model.[26]\\r\\nA cross-sectional study between 2003 and 2011 showed remarkable increases in health insurance coverage and inpatient reimbursement were accompanied by increased use and coverage. The increases in services use are particularly important in rural areas and at hospitals. Major advances have been made in achieving equal access to insurance coverage, inpatient reimbursement, and basic health services, most notably for hospital delivery, and use of outpatient and inpatient care.[27]\\r\\nNowadays, with substantial urbanisation, attention on health care has been changed. Urbanisation offers opportunities for improvements in population health in China (such as access to improved health care and basic infrastructure) and substantial health risks including air pollution, occupational and traffic hazards, and the risks conferred by changing diets and activity. Communicable infections should also be re-focused on.[28]\\r\\nIn 2005 China had about 1,938,000 physicians (1.5 per 1,000 persons) and about 3,074,000 hospital beds (2.4 per 1,000 persons).[29] Health expenditures on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis were US$224 per capita in 2001, or 5.5 percent of gross domestic product ().[citation needed] Some 37.2 percent of public expenditures were devoted to health care in China in 2001.[citation needed] However, about 80 percent of the health and medical care services are concentrated in cities, and timely medical care is not available to more than 100 million people in rural areas. To offset this imbalance, in 2005 China set out a five-year plan to invest 20 billion renminbi (RMB; US$2.4 billion) to rebuild the rural medical service system composed of village clinics and township- and county-level hospitals.[30]\\r\\nThere is a shortage of doctors and nurses in China. More doctors are being trained, but most aim to leave the countryside in favor of the cities, leaving significant shortages in rural areas.[31]\\r\\nIn 2016 it was reported that Ticket resale was widely practised at Beijing Tongren Hospital and Peking University First Hospital. Advance tickets for outpatient consultation are sold by the hospitals for 200 yuan, but sold on for as much as 3,000 yuan. An eye doctor commented that the appointment fees did not reflect the economic value of doctors' skills and experience and that the scalpers were selling the doctor's appointment at a price the market is prepared to pay.[32]\\r\\nThe Chinese medical education system is based on the British model. While some medical schools run three-year programs, hospitals tend to recruit physicians who graduated from five-year programs, while big-name hospitals only accept MDs, which takes seven years of study, including the five years of undergraduate studies, followed by the completion of a PhD in medicine. Once a student graduates from medical school, he or she must work 1ÿ3 years in a university-affiliated hospital, after which the student is eligible to take the National Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE) for physician certification, which is conducted by the National Medical Examination Center (NMEC). If the candidate passes, he or she becomes a professional physician, and is certified by the Ministry of Health. It is illegal to practice medicine in China as a physician or assistant physician without being certified by the Ministry of Health.[33] Physicians are allowed to open their own clinics after practicing medicine for five years.\\r\\nChina has one of the longest recorded history of medicine records of any existing civilization. The methods and theories of traditional Chinese medicine have developed for over two thousand years. Western medical theory and practice came to China in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, notably through the efforts of missionaries[34] and the Rockefeller Foundation, which together founded Peking Union Medical College. Today Chinese traditional medicine continues alongside western medicine and traditional physicians, who also receive some western medical training, are sometimes primary care givers in the clinics and pharmacies of rural China. Various traditional preventative and self-healing techniques such as qigong, which combines gentle exercise and meditation, are widely practiced as an adjunct to professional health care.\\r\\nAlthough the practice of traditional Chinese medicine was strongly promoted by the Chinese leadership and remained a major component of health care, Western medicine gained increasing acceptance in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, the number of physicians and pharmacists trained in Western medicine reportedly increased by 225,000 from 1976 to 1981, and the number of physicians' assistants trained in Western medicine increased by about 50,000. In 1981 there were reportedly 516,000 senior physicians trained in Western medicine and 290,000 senior physicians trained in traditional Chinese medicine. The goal of China's medical professionals is to synthesize the best elements of traditional and Western approaches.\\r\\nIn practice, however, this combination has not always worked smoothly. In many respects, physicians trained in traditional medicine and those trained in Western medicine constitute separate groups with different interests. For instance, physicians trained in Western medicine have been somewhat reluctant to accept unscientific traditional practices, and traditional practitioners have sought to preserve authority in their own sphere. Although Chinese medical schools that provided training in Western medicine also provided some instruction in traditional medicine, relatively few physicians were regarded as competent in both areas in the mid-1980s.\\r\\nThe extent to which traditional and Western treatment methods were combined and integrated in the major hospitals varied greatly. Some hospitals and medical schools of purely traditional medicine were established. In most urban hospitals, the pattern seemed to be to establish separate departments for traditional and Western treatment. In the county hospitals, however, traditional medicine received greater emphasis.\\r\\nTraditional medicine depends on herbal treatments, acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion (burning of herbs over acupuncture points), \\"cupping\\" (local suction of skin), qigong (coordinated movement, breathing, and awareness), tui na (massage), and other culturally unique practices. Such approaches are believed to be most effective in treating minor and chronic diseases, in part because of milder side effects. Traditional treatments may be used for more serious conditions as well, particularly for such acute abdominal conditions as appendicitis, pancreatitis, and gallstones; sometimes traditional treatments are used in combination with Western treatments. A traditional method of orthopedic treatment, involving less immobilization than Western methods, continued to be widely used in the 1980s.\\r\\nAfter 1949 the Ministry of Public Health was responsible for all health-care activities and established and supervised all facets of health policy. Along with a system of national, provincial, and local facilities, the ministry regulated a network of industrial and state enterprise hospitals and other facilities covering the health needs of workers of those enterprises. In 1981 this additional network provided approximately 25 percent of the country's total health services.\\r\\nHealth care was provided in both rural and urban areas through a three-tiered system. In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people; given their importance as health care providers, particularly in rural areas, the government introduced measures to improve their performance through organised training and an annual licensing exam.[35] At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the \\"rural collective health system\\" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year medical schools. Utilisation of health services in rural areas has been shown to increase as a result of the rise in income in rural households and the government's substantial fiscal investment in health.[36][37] Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage.","input":"What type of healthcare system does china have?"},{"output":"tooth-bearing","context":"The alveolar process (/?l?vi??l?r/[1]) also called the (alveolar bone) is the thickened ridge of bone that contains the tooth sockets (dental alveoli) on the jaw bones that hold teeth. In humans, the tooth-bearing bones are the maxilla and the mandible.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the maxilla, the alveolar process is a ridge on the inferior surface, and on the mandible it is a ridge on the superior surface. It makes up the thickest part of the maxillae.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alveolar process contains a region of compact bone adjacent to the periodontal ligament (PDL), called the lamina dura when viewed on radiographs. It is this part which is attached to the cementum of the roots by the periodontal ligament. It is uniformly radiopaque (or lighter). Integrity of the lamina dura is important when studying radiographs for pathological lesions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alveolar process has a supporting bone, both of which have the same components: fibers, cells, intercellular substances, nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alveolar process is the lining of the tooth socket or alveolus (plural, alveoli). Although the alveolar process is composed of compact bone, it may be called the cribriform plate because it contains numerous holes where Volkmann canals pass from the alveolar bone into the PDL. The alveolar bone proper is also called bundle bone[citation needed] because Sharpey fibers, a part of the fibers of the PDL, are inserted here. Similar to those of the cemental surface, Sharpey fibers in alveolar bone proper are each inserted at 90 degrees, or at a right angle, but are fewer in number, although thicker in diameter than those present in cementum. As in cellular cementum, Sharpey fibers in bone are generally mineralized only partially at their periphery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alveolar crest is the most cervical rim of the alveolar bone proper. In a healthy situation, the alveolar crest is slightly apical to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) by approximately 1.5 to 2?mm.[2]  The alveolar crests of neighboring teeth are also uniform in height along the jaw in healthy situation.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supporting alveolar bone consists of both cortical bone and trabecular bone. The cortical bone, or cortical plates, consists of plates of compact bone on the facial and lingual surfaces of the alveolar bone. These cortical plates are usually about 1.5 to 3?mm thick over posterior teeth, but the thickness is highly variable around anterior teeth.[2] The trabecular bone consists of cancellous bone that is located between the alveolar bone proper and the plates of cortical bone. The alveolar bone between two neighboring teeth is the interdental septum (or interdental bone).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mineral content of alveolar bone is mostly calcium hydroxyapatite, which is similar to that found in higher percentages in both enamel and dentin, but is most similar to the levels in cementum (50%). Like all bone, mature alveolar bone is by weight 60% mineralized or inorganic material, 25% organic material, and 15% water. The minerals of potassium, manganese, magnesium, silica, iron, zinc, selenium, boron, phosphorus, sulfur, chromium, and others are also present but in smaller amounts. Alveolar bone is more easily remodeled than cementum, thus allowing orthodontic tooth movement. When viewing a stained histological section, the remodeled alveolar bone shows arrest lines and reversal lines, as does all bone tissue.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe developmental disturbance of anodontia (or hypodontia, if only one tooth), in which tooth germs are congenitally absent, may affect the development of the alveolar processes. This occurrence can prevent the alveolar processes of either the maxillae or the mandible from developing. Proper development is impossible because the alveolar unit of each dental arch must form in response to the tooth germs in the area.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter extraction of a tooth, the clot in the alveolus fills in with immature bone, which later is remodeled into mature secondary bone. However, with the partial or total loss of teeth, the alveolar process undergoes resorption. The underlying basal bone of the body of the maxilla or mandible remains less affected, however, because it does not need the presence of teeth to remain viable. The loss of alveolar bone, coupled with attrition of the teeth, causes a loss of height of the lower third of the vertical dimension of the face when the teeth are in maximum intercuspation. The extent of this loss is determined based on clinical judgment using the Golden Proportions.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe density of the alveolar bone in a given area also determines the route that dental infection takes with abscess formation, as well as the efficacy of local infiltration during the use of local anesthesia. In addition, the differences in alveolar process density determine the easiest and most convenient areas of bony fracture to be used, if needed during tooth extraction of impacted teeth.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring chronic periodontal disease that has affected the periodontium (periodontitis), localized bone tissue is also lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis X-ray film reveals some bone loss on the right side of the mandible. The associated teeth exhibit poor crown-to-root ratios and may be subject to secondary occlusal trauma.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlveolar process\\r\\n\\r\\nAlveolar process of maxilla\\r\\n\\r\\nAlveolar process of mandible","input":"What type of bone is the maxillary bone?"},{"output":"255 episodes and the 2-1/2 hour finale","context":"M*A*S*H is an American television series developed by Larry Gelbart and adapted from the 1970 feature film MASH (which was itself based on the 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors by Richard Hooker).[1] It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the 4077th M*A*S*H (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War.[2] The episodes were produced by 20th Century Fox Television for the CBS network and aired from September 17, 1972, to February 28, 1983.[2] The series, which covered a three-year military conflict, spanned 11 seasons and 255 episodes and the 2-1/2 hour finale.[3]\\r\\nThe regular cast originally consisted of Alan Alda as Captain Benjamin Franklin \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and Wayne Rogers as Captain \\"Trapper\\" John McIntyre, two surgeons; McLean Stevenson as Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, a surgeon and the base commander; Loretta Swit as Major Margaret J. \\"Hot Lips\\" Houlihan, the head nurse; Larry Linville as Major Frank Burns, another surgeon; and Gary Burghoff as Corporal Walter \\"Radar\\" O'Reilly, the company clerk.

As revenge for not being invited to Aurora's christening, an evil fairy named Maleficent curses the newborn princess, foretelling that she will die on her 16th birthday by pricking her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle.

However, Costa's southern accent nearly cost her the role until she proved that she could sustain a fake British accent for the entire film. In order to accommodate the unprecedentedly detailed backgrounds of the film, Aurora's refined design demanded more attention than had ever been paid to an animated character before, drawing inspiration from Art Nouveau.

With only 18 lines of dialogue and equally as few minutes of screen time, the character speaks less than any speaking main character in a full-length Disney animated feature film.\\r\\nWhen Sleeping Beauty was released in 1959, the film was both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for decades. Aurora herself received negative reviews for her passivity and overall similarity to Snow White, and thus would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaid's Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However, Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically, Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Despite having since established herself as a popular character for her beauty and fashion, Aurora's personality continues to receive negative press, particularly from feminist critics, thus earning her a reputation as one of Disney's most passive princess characters. Actress Elle Fanning portrays a live-action version of Aurora in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of its villain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFilmmaker Walt Disney had long been attempting to adapt the fairy tale \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" into a full-length animated feature film for several years, basing it on both Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm's versions of the story.[4] Disney was considering abandoning work on the film completely until singer Mary Costa was discovered, the casting of whom as the film's heroine finally allowed the project to graduate from development to production.[5] At the time Aurora was conceived, there had only been two other Disney princesses: Snow White and Cinderella, the heroines of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Cinderella (1950), respectively.[5] Disney wanted his third princess to be as different from Snow White as possible,[6] but several strong similarities remain between the two characters and their respective stories.[7] Gary Susman of Moviefone observed that both films feature \\"an evil witch jealous of a young and beautiful princess, the princess hiding out in a woodland cottage with a group of comic-relief caretakers ... and the witch putting the princess into a deathlike sleep, from which only true love's kiss can awaken her.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn the original fairy tale, the princess actually sleeps for 100 years before she is finally awoken by the prince's kiss; this detail was adjusted for the film in favor of having Prince Phillip introduced much earlier, and thus Aurora is awoken much sooner.[7] The writers also omitted darker elements featured in the earliest versions of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", such as the princess being raped and impregnated with twins by the prince while she is asleep.[9] In the Brothers Grimm's version, the princess is destined to prick her finger at the age of 15, while Disney decided to make the character one year older.[10] Aurora's names are borrowed from both Tchaikovsky's ballet and the Brothers Grimm's version of the fairy tale. While Tchaikovsky referred to his princess as \\"Aurora\\", the Brothers Grimm named her \\"Little Briar Rose\\".[11] This ultimately inspired Disney to use both,[12] the latter of which serves as the character's alias while she is hiding from Maleficent.[8] Aurora was the last princess in whose conception Walt Disney himself was directly involved.[13][14]\\r\\nAccording to the 2008 Platinum DVD Commentary for the movie, original character concepts for Aurora included a proto-Jasmine personality, with the princess being strictly raised in Stefan's castle and wanting to run away and be free from royal constraints. However, in an attempt to make Aurora different form predecessors Snow White and Cinderella, they decided to not let her be raised in her own home nor with the knowledge or understanding of her villain. This desire to set her apart from the other Golden Era princesses is why she is hidden in the woods with an alias. The idea for her character, though, is very clearly passed onto Jasmine, from Aladdin, and wouldn't be the first example of taking conceptions for Disney one movie and applying them to another. (Other less noted ones are the dancing in the cloud scene at the end of this movie that Walt Disney wanted in both Snow White and Cinderella and the Maleficent and Phillip dungeon scene that Disney originally planned for the Prince and the Evil Queen, but decided against because he felt his animators wouldn't be able to realistically draw a human male for that long.)\\r\\nAurora is voiced by American singer Mary Costa,[15] who was 22 years old when she was cast as the character in 1952.[16] Costa had grown up a fan of Disney films, the first of which she saw was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.[5] As a child, Costa adored the film so much that she would imitate Snow White by parading around her house wearing a bath towel as a makeshift cape.[17] Costa referred to her garnering the role of Aurora as simply a case of \\"being in the right place at the right time.\\"[18] The filmmakers had long been struggling to cast Aurora, having been searching for the right voice for the character for three years. Disney himself had been preparing to shelve the project less they find a suitable voice actress;[19] he strongly believed that the same person should provide both the character's speaking and singing voices.[16] Costa was attending a dinner party for the entertainment industry, to which she had been invited by a friend who was hoping to introduce her to influential people,[16] where she performed the popular standard \\"When I Fall in Love\\".[20] The performance was heard by film composer Walter Schumann who, impressed by her vocals, approached Costa about possibly voicing Aurora and inviting her to audition the following morning.[20] Despite her doubts that she would actually be cast, Costa agreed to audition mostly because she wanted to meet Walt Disney.[17] Upon arriving at the studio the next day, composer George Bruns welcomed Costa by asking her to perform a bird call,[5][17] which she did successfully.[20] However, being from Knoxville, Tennessee, Costa's strong southern accent nearly prevented her from being cast until she proved that she could sustain a fake British accent for the entire film.[12][20] The filmmakers likened the situation to English actress Vivien Leigh successfully feigning a southern accent for her role as Scarlet O'Hara in the film Gone With the Wind (1939).[17] Within hours of her audition,[18] Walt Disney himself contacted Costa via telephone to offer her the job,[21] which she immediately accepted.[20]\\r\\nCosta communicated with Walt Disney at least twice a week for nine months,[19][16] but almost exclusively via telephone because the producer feared that her personality or physical appearance would influence his vision of Aurora if they were to meet in person too soon.[5] They first met when Costa was recording \\"Once Upon a Dream\\", Walt's favorite song in the film.[5] When Costa asked Walt why he decided to cast her as Aurora out of all the actresses who auditioned, the producer explained that it was because her singing voice sounded \\"like an extension of speech.\\"[5] Walt advised Costa to \\"paint with [her] voice\\",[20] as well as refuse to let anyone demonstrate her lines for her.[17] Walt also instructed Costa to avoid catching a cold, eat a warm meal two hours prior to her recording sessions, exercise her vocal chords, and get nine hours of sleep every night.[15] Walt and Costa developed a special father-daughter relationship.[16] Aurora's supervising animator Marc Davis would often observe and sketch Costa while she worked in order to incorporate her mannerisms into the character.[5] Costa worked closely with actresses Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy, the voices of Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, respectively,[20] with whom she became good friends,[5] while declaring the utmost respect for actress Eleanor Audley, voice of Maleficent.[17][20] She also recorded with actor Bill Shirley, voice of Prince Phillip, admitting to having had a crush on him.[5] Costa cites the scene in which Aurora and Phillip meet as her favorite.[20] Schumann, the composer responsible for discovering Costa, died before the film was completed.[16]\\r\\nCosta's singing voice is a combination of classical and pop singing.[19] Aurora's songs were recorded within the first year of production.[16] Costa would practice her songs live with the orchestra before recording them.[16] After working on the film for three years,[16] Costa finally finished recording in 1955,[19] long before the film was completed; it would take the animators another several years to complete the footage to accompany Costa's vocals and dialogue.[8] Costa would often return to the studio to re-record lines as the story changed and evolved,[19] which she described as a \\"painstaking\\" process.[16] However, with only 18 spoken lines, Aurora speaks less than any other main character in a full-length Disney animated feature ÿ aside from Dumbo, who is completely silent ÿ[22] and has absolutely no dialogue once she is awoken from her deep sleep.[8] The character's lack of dialogue is attributed to the fact that she remains asleep for the majority of the film.[23] Ultimately, Costa's performance in Sleeping Beauty ÿ and Walt Disney himself ÿ inspired her to pursue a full-time career as a professional opera singer.[5] Costa's salary was $250 per week.[24]\\r\\nAurora's blurb on the Disney Princess website once cited the character as \\"gentle and loving\\".[25] Walt Disney introduced Aurora to Costa as \\"a very layered character\\", describing her as \\"different. She's calm, yet she's playful. She has a sense of humor, and she has an imagination.\\"[17] Despite popular opinion that Aurora is a very passive character, Costa believes that the princess is actually \\"very strong\\", citing her urge to defy her guardians as an example of her strength, while referring to the character as \\"a beautiful personification of femininity.\\"[5] Raised exclusively by three women in a very sheltered environment, Aurora had never been exposed to a man prior to meeting Phillip.[16] Costa believes that, because of this, Aurora is \\"innately romantic\\" as opposed to simply lonely, explaining, there \\"was a certain part of her that maybe she didnt realize that was just so romantic and maybe expecting something that she didnt even know what\\", and credits the fact that she was raised by three older women as opposed to her parents with making her \\"a little bit older, and yet, she ... had this young outreaching spirit.\\"[16] A very loving character, Aurora enjoyed her lonely life as much as she did because she had never experienced anything else.[16] Additionally, the character's close companionship with woodland creatures is used to demonstrate that she is a loving individual.[26]\\r\\nWalt Disney challenged his animators to make the film's characters appear \\"as real as possible\\".[27] Animator Marc Davis was the supervising animator for Aurora, responsible for animating the character's most important scenes.[28] By the time he started working on Sleeping Beauty, Davis' prior work experience had already established him as \\"one of Walt Disneys go-to animators for pretty girls,\\"[29] having previously animated Snow White and Cinderella,[30] as well as Alice from Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Tinker Bell from Peter Pan (1953).[31] Although heroines are among the most difficult characters to animate, Davis' knowledge of the human body and anatomy \\"brought these iconic female characters to life and made them believable\\", according to The Walt Disney Family Museum.[32] While other Sleeping Beauty animators struggled to adapt to artistic director Eyvind Earle's unprecedented preference for detailed backgrounds, Davis himself rather embraced this new style.[29] Collaborating with character designer Tom Oreb on Aurora, Davis \\"crafted a leading lady of elegance.\\"[29] With a dignified, angular shape that complimented Earles vertical and horizontal backgrounds, the princess was \\"more refined\\" than preceding Disney heroines, and thus required much more attention to detail than any animated character before her.[29] Quality control animator Iwao Takamoto described working on Aurora as \\"a laborious job ... because the drawings were so refined\\", and ultimately limited in-betweeners such as himself to completing only seven drawings per day.[29] With an artistry \\"characterized by a sense of style\\", Davis incorporated Art Nouveau and Art Deco into Aurora's long, golden curls.[29][30] The character was also drawn with violet eyes, Disney's first princess to have eyes that are this color.[33][34] Notably, Davis animated Aurora throughout the entire film as opposed to eventually being replaced by another animator which, according to Costa, would have altered the appearance of the character for the worse.[5] Aurora's refined features compliment those of her nemesis Maleficent, who is similarly as refined and \\"alluring\\" but in a more \\"manipulative manner.\\"[29] Both characters were animated by Davis.[29][35]\\r\\nWalt Disney strongly encouraged Costa to work closely with Davis while he animated Aurora so that she could learn as much as possible about her character and familiarize herself with \\"all aspects of her.\\"[17] Drawing Aurora to resemble her voice actress,[36] Davis incorporated Costa's habit of gesturing with her hands while speaking and singing into the character's design, and defended the singer's performance when it was incorrectly referred to a voice-over by a fan, explaining that Costa's voice was \\"the ocean of sound upon which we animated.\\"[36] Davis and Costa eventually became close friends.[16] Actress and dancer Helene Stanley served as the live-action model for Aurora, providing visual reference for the animators.[8] The performer was recruited due to the high degree of realism required to animate Aurora.[28] Stanley's costume was designed by costume designer Alice Estes at the behest of Davis, then a student of the animator at Chouinard Art Institute.[37] To compliment the \\"tapestry pattern\\" of the film's backgrounds, Estes agreed to design the dress to \\"move like [the tapestry] was animated.\\"[38] Estes and Davis eventually got married.[29] Meanwhile, British actress Audrey Hepburn served as Oreb's inspiration for Aurora's body type,[39][40] from whom they borrowed the princess' \\"elegant, slender features\\".[6] The studio disagreed about whether Aurora's gown should be pink or blue, a conflict that was written into the film in the form of an argument between Flora and Merryweather.[13] Aurora has a total of only 18 minutes of screen time.[22]\\r\\nAurora is a member of a trifecta known as the \\"Golden Era\\" of Disney heroines.[41] Alongside her two predecessors Snow White and Cinderella, Aurora is one of the three original Disney princesses.[42] Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles wrote that Aurora continued the \\"trend of passive heroines who wait around for magic to change their lives,\\" a recurring theme shared by Disney princesses who were introduced both during and prior to the 1950s.[43] Sonia Saraiya of Nerve dubbed Aurora \\"the apex\\" of \\"women who made no choices for themselves\\".[44] Writing for MTV, Lauren Vino felt that the character \\"followed the basic princess tenants of loving animals and sleeping in makeup\\",[45] while About.com's David Nusair wrote that Aurora followed the \\"pattern of kind yet helpless princesses\\", similar to Snow White and Cinderella.[41] Mary Grace Garis of Bustle observed that the original trio \\"seek[s] out marriage as both their endgame and salvation\\", elaborating, \\"It's literally their own means of escape, and their only final objective.\\"[42] However, Aurora's dreams and fantasies are different in the sense that they are drawn from loneliness and isolation; the character essentially longs \\"for human connections beyond her three fairy surrogate mothers.\\"[9] The Walt Disney Family Museum volunteer Lucas O. Seastrom agreed that Aurora is more \\"self-confident\\" and \\"more of repose than the usual naivet of Disney heroines.\\"[29] Observing that Aurora's actions are influenced by the decisions and opinions of those around her, while most of the film's action involves Prince Phillip, Steinkellner joked that the character is so passive that she remains asleep during the film's climax.[43] Dubbing her \\"a girl of reaction,\\" nerdology.org's Lisa Kaye Cunningham felt that Aurora's \\"little screen time makes [her] difficult to classify as a feminist, but her single active decision shows great promise in the evolution of feminist Disney princesses,\\" despite the fact that her agency is constantly undermined by other characters.[2] Cunningham concluded, \\"By making one active decision to try and follow her dreams, this princess made a big step forward as a stronger feminist than Snow White, though Aurora remains bogged down with passive reactivity.\\"[2] Author Melissa G. Wilson observed in her book Mashups for Teens: From Sleeping Beauty to Beyonce that Aurora's reaction upon learning that she is a princess differs from what one would expect from a young woman.[46]\\r\\nBy default, Aurora is usually considered to be the film's main character.[47] Leigh Butler of Tor.com argues that the role of \\"protagonist\\" rightfully belongs to the three good fairies because they \\"make all the critical decisions in the film, the ones which drive the action\\", while Aurora acts as little more than a pawn.[48] Butler expounded that Aurora \\"never grows as a character during the course of the film; she has no agency at all, in fact. She doesnt act; she is acted upon. So she is definitely not the hero of the story.\\"[48] Helping Writers Become Authors' K. M. Weiland agreed, writing, \\"Sleeping Beauty has no arc. Prince Phillip has no arc. And, even more importantly, neither of them are present from start to finish in the story. Without the fairies to hold this thing together, the plot would have lacked any kind of impetus or cohesion.\\"[47] Upon initial viewing of Sleeping Beauty, a writer for Anibundel originally dismissed Aurora as \\"the ultimate Disney princess in the most negative and passive sense of the stereotype ... playing no part whatsoever in her own outcome.\\" However, in retrospect, the author's opinion eventually evolved upon subsequent viewings: \\"Although Aurora has little to do with her own conclusion, its not a mark of her being a non-person. Instead it reflects how sometimes bad things just happen which we have no control over, a difficult but important lesson.\\"[9] Anibundel does agree that although Aurora is Sleeping Beauty's title character, she can hardly be considered the film's protagonist, instead believing instead that the film actually lacks one completely.[9] Meanwhile, the author dubbed Aurora the film's most sympathetic character because she has \\"thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and emotions,\\" elaborating, \\"While most characters ... are overly focused on the plot and reacting to events, Briar Rose is unaware of the other events so we get to see a more authentic everyday side of her.\\"[9] In his book Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment, author Douglas Brode wrote that the fairies' raising of Aurora mirrors \\"precisely that sort of women's commune numerous feminists experimented with throughout the seventies.\\"[10]\\r\\nWriting for Durham College's The Water Buffalo, Michelle Munro observed that the first five Disney Princesses share physical and personality traits, namely their white skin, naivety, kindness and compassion, \\"show[ing] viewers what Disney believed a princess should look and act like\\" at that time.[49] Munro concluded that Aurora specifically can appear both spoiled and childish in demeanor at times.[49] Bailey Cavender of The Silver Petticoat Review believes that the character's appearance and style is reminiscent of the Gibson Girl, a popular character created and designed by graphic artist Charles Dana Gibson, who embodied the idea that \\"physical beauty was a measure of fitness, character, and Americanness\\".[35] According to Cavender, Aurora's beauty was considered to be \\"ideal\\" for women at the time her film was released, embodying the \\"classic standards of beauty.\\"[35] In his book Debating Disney: Pedagogical Perspectives on Commercial Cinema, Douglas Brode agreed that Aurora is \\"a model of modern (1950s) female glamour\\", comparing her long blonde hair to that of actress Brigitte Bardot while likening her gown to the work of fashion designer Christian Dior.[3] According to The Dissolve's Noel Murray, Aurora's story is a metaphor about a \\"young woman being cautioned to avoid penetration.\\"[50] Similarly, Carrie R. Wheadon, writing for Common Sense Media, interpreted Aurora's arousal by a handsome prince as being symbolic of a young woman's \\"transition to adulthood and sexual awakening.\\"[51] According to Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment author Douglas Brode, Aurora is \\"torn between childlike loyalties and adult instincts\\",[10] while The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past author Tison Pugh believes that Aurora's first encounter with Prince Phillip \\"tips her from fantasy into reality, from childhood into womanhood.\\"[52]\\r\\nAurora debuted in Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving an invitation to her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose to protect her from Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.\\r\\nIn Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams (2007), Aurora, voiced by actress Erin Torpey,[53] stars in the segment \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\", in which her parents leave her responsible for running the kingdom in their two-day absence. Refusing assistance from the fairies, they give her her own wand instead should she need help. At first reluctant to use it because she is determined to accomplish everything on her own, Aurora eventually succumbs when her duties prove overwhelming. However, her inexperience with magic leads to several consequences, which she is then forced to solve without magic.\\r\\nIn Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of the animated film in which Sleeping Beauty is retold from the perspective of the villain, Aurora is portrayed by actress Elle Fanning,[54] while actress Janet McTeer voices an elderly version of the character in the role of film's narrator.[55] The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by the fairy in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; Aurora affectionately refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, Aurora is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss to her forehead as opposed to a prince's. Aurora defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and the fairy kingdom known as the Moors.\\r\\nA live-action version of Aurora appears as a recurring character in the fantasy television series Once Upon a Time, portrayed by actress Sarah Bolger.[56] She made a guest appearance in a Sofia the First episode, Holiday in Enchancia called on by the mystical amulet of Avalor to assist young Princess Sofia in finding her missing stepfather, King Roland II. She assured Sofia that she could rely on her animal friends' to help just she had long ago.\\r\\nAurora, alongside other Disney Princesses, is set to cameo in the film Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2, as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.[citation needed]\\r\\nAurora appears as a non-player character in the Kingdom Hearts video game series, depicted as one of the seven Princesses of Heart.[57] In the sequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep (2010), the character is depicted as one of seven Aurora appears in Kinect Disneyland Adventures (2011),[58] asking players to collect items various items, including songs performed by birds.[59]\\r\\nPerformers dressed as Aurora make \\"fairly regular\\" appearances throughout several popular locations at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, specifically Walt Disney World's Epcot France Pavilion,[60] Cinderella's Royal Table, Disney Dreams Come True Parade, and Princess Fairytale Hall in the Magic Kingdom,[61][62] Fantasyland's Princess Meet 'n' Greet at Disneyland California, Fantasyland's Princess Pavilion and Auberge de Cendrillon at Disneyland Paris, Fantasyland and World Bazaar at Tokyo Disneyland, and the Wishing Well at Hong Kong Disneyland.[63]\\r\\nThe Walt Disney Company currently has a trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office, filed March 13, 2007, for the name \\"Princess Aurora\\" that covers production and distribution of motion picture films; production of television programs; production of sound and video recordings.[64] This has caused some controversy because \\"Princess Aurora\\" is the name of the lead character in The Sleeping Beauty Ballet, from where Disney acquired the name and some of the music for its animated film, and which is performed live on stage and sometimes television and often sold later as a recorded performance on video.[65] The trademark was granted on January 17, 2012.[64]\\r\\nInitial critical response towards Aurora was generally unfavorable.[66][46] During the 1950s, Disney received \\"harsh criticism\\" for depicting both Cinderella and Aurora as \\"na?ve and malleable\\" characters, and failing to acknowledge the ways in which women's roles in society had evolved since Snow White's debut in 1937.[66] Critics agree that Aurora represents \\"the classic damsel in distress\\" by being depicted as a beautiful young woman who is rescued by a stranger.[46] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the character was too similar to Snow White, writing, \\"The princess looks so much like Snow White they could be a couple of Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years.\\"[67] Time Out dismissed Aurora as a \\"delicate\\" and \\"vapid\\" character.[68] Bustle's Mary Grace Garis wrote that the character \\"suffers from having very little definable personality and ... serious Damsel-in-Distress syndrome\\".[42] Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing Aurora for lacking \\"interesting qualities\\"; Saraiya also ranked Aurora Disney's least feminist princess.[69] Similarly, Bustle also ranked Aurora the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, \\"Aurora literally sleeps for like three quarters of the movie ... Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn't doing much in the way of feminine progress.\\"[70] Dismissing the character as \\"barely more than a cipher\\", Leigh Butler of Tor.com panned Aurora as \\"a Barbie doll knockoff who does nothing the whole film but sing wistfully about Finding Her Man, before becoming the ultimate passive Damsel in Distress\\". However, Butler went on to defend the character somewhat, writing, \\"Auroras cipher-ness in Sleeping Beauty would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what all women are.\\"[48] Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because \\"Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game.\\"[71]\\r\\nAurora was Disney's last princess created before Walt Disney's death in 1966.[13] When Sleeping Beauty was first released in 1959, the film performed poorly at the box office while failing to impress critics.[50] According to TheRichest, Aurora was partially responsible for Disneys only overall loss that decade,[1] thus the studio decided to avoid adapting fairy tales into feature-length animated films for several years; Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaid's Ariel debuted in 1989, 30 years later.[50] Mic's Melissa Hugel believes that the negative reception spawned by Aurora's passive role as a woman in Sleeping Beauty also contributed to this hiatus,[66] earning the character a reputation as one of Disney's worst princesses.[2][72][73][74][75][9] Meanwhile, David Nusair of About.com attributes the film's failure with \\"the familiarity of its storyline, as the film boasts many of the elements contained within both of its predecessors ÿ including the revelation that Princess Aurora can only be awoken from her deep slumber by a kiss from her one true love\\" similar to Snow White.[41] Hollywood.com ranked Sleeping Beauty Disney's worst princess film because its main character remains asleep for the majority of it.[76] However, Aurora has since established herself as a popular character nonetheless due to her singing voice and beauty.[1] At one point, the name \\"Aurora\\" became a popular baby name, with parents often naming their daughters after the character.[19] However, despite being featured prominently in Disney merchandise, \\"Aurora has become an oft-forgotten princess\\", and her popularity pales in comparison to those of Cinderella and Snow White.[14] While creating the Disney Princess franchise, Disney Consumer Products decided that Aurora should be marketed wearing the pink version of her dress in order to further distinguish her from Cinderella, who also wears blue.[77] BuzzFeed readers voted Aurora their sixth favorite Disney Princess, who garnered 7% of the 9,554 votes.[78] Time reported that Aurora was the seventh best-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2014, having sold $215,856 in merchandise.[79]\\r\\nMedia publications often tend to place Aurora towards the end of their Disney Princess rankings. Seventeen ranked Aurora last on their \\"Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses\\" list.[80] Similarly, BuzzFeed also ranked Aurora last.[81] Moviepilot placed Aurora last on the website's \\"All of the Disney Princess Ranked from Worst to Best\\" ranking, with author Kristin Lai dismissing the character as \\"a snooze.\\"[82] Meanwhile, MTV ranked Aurora 12th on the website's \\"Ultimate Ranking Of The Best Disney Princesses Of All Time\\".[45] Similarly, E! also ranked Aurora 12th, with author John Boone elaborating, \\"She's not a bad princess, per se. She might actually be the prettiest of all the princesses ... But she's asleep half the movie! Pretty...but so, so boring.\\"[83] Zimbio ranked Aurora the second worst Disney Princess,[72] while BuzzFeed ranked the character one of Disney's least intelligent princesses, with author Leonora Epstein dismissing Aurora as the \\"equivalent to the child who puts his finger in a socket when expressly told not to.\\"[84] However, the character has garnered recognition for her beauty and fashion, with Stylist extolling Aurora's \\"blow dry\\" as \\"the ultimate hairstyle when it comes to being a princess\\" while ranking it among Disney's \\"Best beauty looks\\",[85] and Bustle dubbing her \\"the hottest Disney Princess\\".[42] Entertainment Weekly ranked Aurora's hair the second best of all the Disney Princesses, with author Annie Barrett describing it as \\"aspirational\\".[86] Oh My Disney ranked the pink and blue versions of Aurora's dress 15th and 16th on their countdown of every Disney Princess outfit, voicing their preference for the character in blue.[87] Marie Claire ranked Aurora's outfits among \\"The 20 Greatest Movie Dresses of All Time\\", writing, \\"Of all the Disney princesses, Sleeping Beauty's Aurora had a fashionable edge\\" potentially worthy of being imitated by singers Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.[88] Aurora was ranked first on Moviepilot's \\"Which Outfit is Fairest of Them All? 13 Disney Divas Ranked\\" list.

BuzzFeed ranked Aurora ninth on the website's ranking of Disney Princess singing voices, with author Kelcie Willis awarding it \\"Extra props for bringing operatic vocals to Disney.\\"[95] Variety complimented Costa's \\"rich and expressive\\" performance, praising the singer for providing Aurora with both \\"substance and strength\\".[96] John Clark of SFGate credited Costa's vocals with \\"manag[ing] to make an enchanting impression in just a few onscreen minutes without being pushy or saccharine.\\"[36] Meanwhile, Artistdirect's Rick Florino wrote that the singer \\"brought a pure and honest vibrancy to the film.\\"[17] Additionally, Sleeping Beauty served as Costa's first singing job, prior to which she had had little professional singing experience.[97] The role has since had a profound impact on Costa's career, allowing her to successfully transition from animated to Operatic roles.[5][16] Walt Disney himself encouraged Costa to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming an opera singer.[5] Costa credits Walt Disney and Sleeping Beauty with instilling a work ethic in her, which she maintained throughout her entire career.[5] Costa has achieved great success as an opera singer;[21] The New York Times hailed her as \\"one of the most beautiful women to grace the operatic stage\\",[97] while Paul MacInnes of The Guardian referred to her as \\"One of America's finest sopranos\\".[98] First Lady Jackie Kennedy personally requested that Costa perform at the memorial service of her late husband, United States President John F. Kennedy.[98] Despite her success elsewhere, Costa continues to hold voicing Aurora in high regard as her greatest accomplishment because the role \\"keeps [her] close to young people.\\"[97] Costa was officially recognized as a Disney Legend in 1999,[97] and continues to make promotional appearances for Disney.[99] In 1997, Costa hosted a theatrical screening of Sleeping Beauty in her hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee to commemorate the film's home video release.[100] In 1989, Costa sued Disney for royalties owed since the film's 1986 home video release, claiming that her contract with the studio prevented them from producing \\"phonograph recordings or transcriptions for sale to the public\\" without her permission, although Disney claimed that the video tapes are simply versions of the film.[101] The case was settled out-of-court in favor of Costa for an undisclosed sum,[102] provided she relinquish all future rights.[24]\\r\\nElle Fanning's performance as Aurora in Maleficent was generally well-received. J.C.

They include indigenous and immigrant languages, with Spanish being dominant. Some are endangered, spoken by elderly people whose descendants do not speak the languages.[2] There is evidence of some now extinct languages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArgentina is predominantly a Spanish-speaking country  the fourth largest after Mexico, Spain, and Colombia (according to a compilation of national census figures and United Nations estimates, see List of countries with Spanish-speaking populations). Based on the 2010 national census and supporting research, there are about 40.9 million Spanish speakers in Argentina (almost the entire population).[3][4]\\r\\nArgentina is one of several Spanish-speaking countries (along with Uruguay, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica) that almost universally use what is known as voseothe use of the pronoun vos instead of t~ (the familiar \\"you\\") as well as its corresponding verb forms. The most prevalent dialect is Rioplatense, whose speakers are located primarily in the basin of the Ro de la Plata.\\r\\nA phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of [CONICET] and the University of Toronto[5] showed that the intonation Porte?o Spanish is unlike that of other Spanish varieties, and suggested that it may be a result of convergence with Italian. Italian immigration influenced Lunfardo, the slang spoken in the Ro de la Plata region, permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other regions as well.\\r\\nAs in other large countries, the accents vary depending on geographical location. Extreme differences in pronunciation can be heard within Argentina. One notable pronunciation difference found in Argentina is the sh sounding y and ll. In most Spanish speaking countries the letters y and ll are pronounced somewhat like the y in yo-yo, however in most parts of Argentina they are pronounced like sh in English (such as \\"shoe\\") or like \\"zh\\" (such as the sound the <s> makes in \\"measure\\").\\r\\nAs previously mentioned voseo is commonly used in Argentina. See the article on voseo for more details.\\r\\nIn many of the central and north-eastern areas of the country the trilled /r/ takes on the same sound as the <ll> and <y> ('zh' - a voiced palatal fricative sound, similar to the \\"s\\" in the English pronunciation of the word \\"vision\\".) For Example, Ro Segundo sounds like Zhio Segundo and Corrientes sounds like Cozhientes.\\r\\nThe ISO639 code for Argentine Spanish is \\"es-AR\\".\\r\\nArgentina has more than 1,500,000 Italian speakers; this tongue is the second most spoken language in the nation as a native language.[6][A] Italian immigration, which effectively began in the middle of the 19th century and reached its peak in the first two decades of the 20th century, made a lasting and significant impact on the pronunciation and vernacular of Argentina's variety of Spanish, giving it an Italian flair. In fact, Italian dialects (not Standard Italian) have contributed so much to Rioplatense that many foreigners mistake it for Italian.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina,[2] as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine.\\r\\nSouth Bolivian Quechua is a Quechuan language spoken by some 800,000 people, mostly immigrants who have arrived in the last years. There are an estimated 70,000 speakers in Salta Province. The language is also known as Central Bolivian Quechua, which has six dialects. It is classified as a Quechua II language and is referred to as Quechua IIC by linguists.\\r\\nStandard German is spoken by between 400,000[2] and 500,000[7] Argentines of German ancestry, though it has also been stated that there could be as many as 1,800,000.[8]\\r\\nThere are around 200,000 Yiddish speakers in Argentina.[7]\\r\\nGuaran is spoken by 200,000 people,[6] mostly in Corrientes (where it is official de jure) and Misiones.[9]\\r\\nThere are 174,000 speakers of the Catalan language.[6]\\r\\nMapudungun is spoken by 100,000 Mapuche people in the provinces of Neuqun, Ro Negro, Chubut, Buenos Aires, and La Pampa.\\r\\nChinese is spoken by at least half of the over 60,000 Chinese immigrants, mostly in Buenos Aires.[10]\\r\\nWich is an indigenous language spoken by 53,700 people, mainly in Chaco[6] where, along with Kom and Moqoit, it is official de jure.[11]\\r\\nVlax Romani is spoken by 52,000 people.[6]\\r\\nJapanese is spoken by 32,000 people.[6]\\r\\nUkrainian is spoken by 27,000 people.[6]\\r\\nWelsh is spoken by over 5,000 people in Chubut province.[12] Some districts have recently incorporated it as an educational language.[13]\\r\\nMocov is spoken by 4,525 people in Santa Fe Province, while Mby Guaran has 3,000 speakers in the northeast.[2] Pilag is spoken by about 2,000 people in the Chaco.[2] There are 1,500 Iyo'wujwa Chorote speakers, 50% of whom are monolingual;[2] Iyo'wujwa Chorote is spoken in the Chaco region and along the Pilcomayo river.[14]\\r\\nSeveral Native American languages spoken in Argentina by the native people (1% of the population) are declining at rates that may result in only a handful of speakers within a generation.[citation needed] Kaiw has 512 speakers, Nivacl 200, Tapiet and Wich Lhamts Nocten only 100. These indigenous languages have suffered slow linguistic and cultural genocide. In this category in terms of number of speakers, one can also include some immigrant languages for instance Plautdietsch with only 140.\\r\\nSome languages are critically endangered, spoken only by a handful of isolated elderly people whose children do not speak the language;[2] they are likely to become dead languages once the remaining speakers die. Vilela has about 20 speakers; Puelche has 5 or 6 speakers; in 2000 Tehuelche had 4 speakers, out of about 200 ethnic Tehuelche people, (2000 W. Adelaar); and in 1991 Selk'nam (also known as Ona) had 1 to 3 speakers and is nearly extinct; full blooded Ona people are already extinct. Most endangered speakers speak[citation needed].\\r\\nAbip܇n, Cacn, Chan and Haush are now extinct languages that were spoken by people indigenous to Argentina before European contact. Very little is known of Cacn and Chan.\\r\\nThe Abip܇n language was a Native American language of the MatacoÿGuaycuru family that was spoken by the Abip܇n people.[15]\\r\\nCacn was spoken by Diaguita and Calchaqu aboriginals, and became extinct during the late 17th century or early 18th century; the only manuscript documenting this language was lost, and now there is not enough information to make it possible to link it to any existing language family.[16]\\r\\nChan was spoken in the Salta Province, and was either a dialect of or closely related to the Terena language of the Arawakan language family.[2]\\r\\nThe Haush language, belonging to the Chonan family, was an indigenous language spoken by the Haush people and was formerly spoken on the island of Tierra del Fuego.[17]\\r\\nCocoliche, a Spanish-Italian creole, was spoken mainly by first and second-generation immigrants from Italy, but is no longer in daily use; it is sometimes used in comedy.

Ya?qob, Greek: ???; died 44?AD) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, and traditionally considered the first apostle to be martyred. He was a son of Zebedee and Salome, and brother of John the Apostle. He is also called James the Greater or James the Great to distinguish him from James, son of Alphaeus and James the brother of Jesus (James the Just). James the son of Zebedee is the patron saint of Spaniards, and as such is often identified as Santiago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe son of Zebedee and Salome, James is styled \\"the Greater\\" to distinguish him from the Apostle James \\"the Less\\". He was the brother of John, the beloved disciple, and probably the elder of the two.[1]\\r\\nHis parents seem to have been people of means. Zebedee, his father, was a fisherman of the Sea of Galilee, who probably lived in or near Bethsaida, present Galilee, Israel, perhaps in Capernaum, and had some boatmen or hired men. Salome, his mother, was one of the pious women who afterwards followed Christ and \\"ministered unto him of their substance\\", and his brother John was personally known to the high-priest, and must have had wherewithal to provide for the Mother of Jesus.[1]\\r\\nIt is probable that his brother had not received the technical training of the rabbinical schools; in this sense they were unlearned and without any official position among the Jews. But, according to the social rank of their parents, they must have been men of ordinary education, in the common walks of Jewish life. James is described as one of the first disciples to join Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels state that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to follow him.[Matt. 4:21-22][Mk. 1:19-20] James was one of only three apostles whom Jesus selected to bear witness to his Transfiguration.[2] James and John[3] (or, in another tradition, their mother[4]) asked Jesus to grant them seats on his right and left in his glory. Jesus rebuked them, and the other ten apostles were annoyed with them. James and his brother wanted to call down fire on a Samaritan town, but were rebuked by Jesus.[Lk 9:51-6] The Acts of the Apostles records that \\"Herod the king\\" (traditionally identified with Herod Agrippa) had James executed by sword. He is the only apostle whose martyrdom is recorded in the New Testament. He is, thus, traditionally believed to be the first of the twelve apostles martyred for his faith.[Acts 12:1-2] Nixon suggests that this may have been caused by James' fiery temper,[5] for which he and his brother earned the nickname Boanerges or \\"Sons of Thunder\\".[Mark 3:17] F. F. Bruce contrasts this story to that of the Liberation of Saint Peter, and notes that \\"James should die while Peter should escape\\" is a \\"mystery of divine providence\\".[6]\\r\\nThe English name \\"James\\" comes from Italian \\"Giacomo\\", a variant of \\"Giacobo\\" derived from Iacobus (Jacob) in Latin, itself from the Greek ??? \\"Iakbos\\", from Hebrew ???????. In French, Jacob evolves into \\"Jacques\\". In eastern Spain, Iacobus (Jacobus) became \\"Jacome\\" or \\"Jaime\\"; in Catalan language, it became \\"Jaume\\". Santiago is the local Galician or Spanish (Castilian) evolution of Vulgar Latin Sanctu Iacobu \\"Saint James\\".[7] \\"Tiago\\" is a popular deglutination native to Portuguese language (santiago > san-tiago = S?o Tiago); it crossed with old Diago to give \\"Diego\\" in Spanish and \\"Diogo\\" in Portuguese, which is also the Spanish name of Saint Didacus of Alcal.[citation needed] For example, Miguel de Cervantes in his famous Don Quixote uses \\"San Diego\\" instead of \\"Santiago\\".\\r\\nSaint James is the patron saint of Spain and, according to legend, his remains are held in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. (The name Santiago is the local evolution of Vulgar Latin Sanctu Iacobu, \\"Saint James\\".) The traditional pilgrimage to the grave of the saint, known as the \\"Way of St. James\\", has been the most popular pilgrimage for Western European Catholics from the Early Middle Ages onwards, although its modern revival and popularity stems from Walter Starkie's 1957 book, The Road to Santiago. The Pilgrims of St. James.[7] Some 237,886 pilgrims registered in 2014 as having completed the final 100?km walk (200?km by bicycle) to Santiago to qualify for a Compostela.[8] When 25 July falls on a Sunday, it is a \\"Jubilee\\" year (an A?o Santo Jubilar Compostelano or A?o Santo Jacobeo) and a special east door is opened for entrance into Santiago Cathedral. Jubilee years fall every 5, 6, and 11 years. In the 2004 Jubilee year, 179,944[9] pilgrims received a Compostela. In 2010 the number had risen to 275,135.[10]\\r\\nThe feast day of St. James is celebrated on 25 July on the liturgical calendars of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and certain Protestant churches. He is commemorated on 30 April in the Orthodox Christian liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 30 April currently falls on 13 May of the modern Gregorian Calendar).\\r\\nThe site of martyrdom is located within the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral of St. James in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. The Chapel of St. James the Great, located to the left of the sanctuary, is the traditional place where he was martyred when King Agrippas ordered him to be beheaded (Acts 12:1-2). His head is buried under the altar, marked by a piece of red marble and surrounded by six votive lamps.[11]\\r\\nThe 12th-century Historia Compostelana commissioned by bishop Diego Gelmrez provides a summary of the legend of St. James as it was believed at Compostela. Two propositions are central to it: first, that St. James preached the gospel in Iberia as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa his disciples carried his body by sea to Iberia, where they landed at Padr܇n on the coast of Galicia, and took it inland for burial at Santiago de Compostela.\\r\\nThe translation of his relics from Judea to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was effected, in legend, by a series of miraculous happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to Iria Flavia in Iberia, where a massive rock closed around his relics, which were later removed to Compostela.\\r\\nAccording to ancient local tradition, on 2 January AD 40, the Virgin Mary appeared to James on the bank of the Ebro River at Caesaraugusta, while he was preaching the Gospel in Iberia. She appeared upon a pillar, Nuestra Se?ora del Pilar, and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, in Zaragoza, Spain. Following that apparition, St. James returned to Judea, where he was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa I in the year 44.[12][13]\\r\\nThe tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king Alfonso II (791-842) and of bishop Theodemir of Iria. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the shrine dedicated to James at Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia in Spain, became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world. The Way of St. James is a trio of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain. Eventually James became the patron saint of Spain.\\r\\nJames suffered martyrdom[Acts 12:1-2] in AD 44. According to the tradition of the early Church, he had not yet left Jerusalem at this time.[14] An argument supporting this assertion is based on St Paul's Epistle to the Romans, written after AD 44, in which he expressed his intention to avoid \\"building on someone else's foundation\\"[Rom. 15:20] by visiting Spain[Rom. 15:23-24], suggesting that he knew of no previous evangelisation in Hispania.\\r\\nThe tradition was not unanimously admitted afterwards, while numerous modern scholars, following Louis Duchesne and T. E. Kendrick,[15] reject it. (According to Kendrick, even if one admits the existence of miracles, James' presence in Spain is impossible.) The Bollandists however defended it (their Acta Sanctorum, July, VI and VII, gives further sources). The suggestion began to be made from the 9th century that, as well as evangelizing in Iberia, his body may have been brought to Compostela. No earlier tradition places the burial of St. James in Hispania. A rival tradition places the relics of the apostle in the church of St. Saturnin at Toulouse; if any physical relics were ever involved, they might plausibly have been divided between the two.\\r\\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia (1908) registered several \\"difficulties\\" or bases for doubts of this tradition, beyond the late appearance of the legend:\\r\\nAlthough the tradition that James founded an apostolic see in Iberia was current in the year 700, no certain mention of such tradition is to be found in the genuine writings of early writers nor in the early councils; the first certain mention we find in the ninth century, in Notker, a monk of St. Gall (Martyrologia, 25 July), Walafrid Strabo (Poema de XII Apostoli), and others.\\r\\nThe authenticity of the relics at Compostela was asserted in the Bull of Pope Leo XIII, Omnipotens Deus, of 1 November 1884.\\r\\nAn even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the legendary battle of Clavijo, and was henceforth called Santiago Matamoros (Saint James the Moor-slayer). ?Santiago, y cierra, Espa?a! (\\"St. James and strike for Spain\\") was the traditional battle cry of medieval Spanish (Christian) armies. Cervantes has Don Quixote explaining that \\"the great knight of the russet cross was given by God to Spain as patron and protector\\".[16]\\r\\nA similar miracle is related about San Milln. The possibility that a cult of James was instituted to supplant the Galician cult of Priscillian (executed in 385) who was widely venerated across the north of Iberia as a martyr at the hands of the bishops rather than as a heretic should not be overlooked. This was cautiously raised by Henry Chadwick in his book on Priscillian;[12] it is not the traditional Roman Catholic view. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1908, however, is quite cautious about the origins of the cult (see above at \\"Controversy\\").\\r\\nJames' emblem was the scallop shell (or \\"cockle shell\\"), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes. The French for a scallop is coquille St. Jacques, which means \\"cockle (or mollusk) of St. James\\". The German word for a scallop is Jakobsmuschel, which means \\"mussel (or clam) of St. James\\"; the Dutch word is Jacobsschelp, meaning \\"shell of St. James\\".\\r\\nThe military Order of Santiago, named after James, was founded in Spain in the 12th century to fight the Moors. Later, as in other orders of chivalry, the membership became a mark of honor.\\r\\nJames had a special place in the Central African Kingdom of Kongo because of his association with the founding of Christianity in the country in the late 15th century. Portuguese sailors and diplomats brought the saint to Kongo when they first reached the country in 1483. When King Afonso I of Kongo whose Kongo name was Mvemba a Nzinga, the second Christian king, was facing a rival, his brother Mpanzu a Kitima, in battle, he reported that a vision of Saint James and the Heavenly Host appeared in the sky, frightened Mpanzu a Kitima's soldiers, and gave Afonso the victory. As a result, he declared that Saint James' feast day (25 July) be celebrated as a national holiday.\\r\\nOver the years, Saint James day became the central holiday of Kongo. Taxes were collected on that day, and men eligible for military duty were required to appear armed. There were usually regional celebrations as well as one at the capital. In some cases, Kongolese slaves carried the celebration to the New World, and there are still celebrations of Saint James Day in Haiti and Puerto Rico.\\r\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that James has been resurrected and that in 1829 healong with the resurrected Peter and the translated Johnvisited Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and restored the priesthood authority with apostolic succession to earth.[17]","input":"Who was the first disciple to be killed?"},{"output":"Constructed from 1887ÿ1889","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower (/?a?f?l/ EYE-f?l; French: Tour Eiffel [tu???f?l]?(?listen)) is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstructed from 1887ÿ1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91?million people ascended it in 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower is 324 metres (1,063?ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410?ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17?ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276?m (906?ft) above the ground ÿ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des tablissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[4] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \\"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\\".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socit des Ingnieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise, \\r\\nNot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grvy was re-elected as president of France and douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300?m (980?ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[6] (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \\"Committee of Three Hundred\\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \\"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection  of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower  To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years  we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nGustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \\"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\\"[9] These criticisms were also dealt with by douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,[10] \\"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \\"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[12] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.[14] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[15] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2?m (6.6?ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15?m (49?ft) long and 6?m (20?ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22?m (72?ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6?m (20?ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10?cm (4?in) in diameter and 7.5?m (25?ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[17] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 0.1?mm (0.0039?in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5?million rivets.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \\"Eiffel Suicide!\\" and \\"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\\" appeared in the tabloid press.[18] At this stage, a small \\"creeper\\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.[15] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[15] only one person died, due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe start of the erection of the metalwork.\\r\\n\\r\\n7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\\r\\n\\r\\n20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\\r\\n\\r\\n15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\\r\\n\\r\\n26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola.\\r\\n\\r\\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.[21] Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around 3.9?m (12?ft 10?in) diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[22] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67?m (41?ft 7?in) long and 96.5?cm (38.0?in) in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of 10.83?m (35?ft 6?in): this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Lon Edoux. A pair of 81?m (266?ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.[12] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustr, completed the ascent. At 2:35?pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[25]\\r\\nTickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[26] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made. There was also a patisserie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse (\\"truly curious\\").[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[25] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[28] Edison signed the guestbook with this message: \\r\\nTo M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\\r\\n\\r\\nEiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[22] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[31] Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 metres) to demonstrate his parachute design.[32] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War?I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[33] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citro?n adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[citation needed] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \\"sold\\" the tower for scrap metal.[35] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[36] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[37] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[38] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[40] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[41] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[42] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[43] On 25 June, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[44] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Andr Malraux.[45] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant.[citation needed] The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[46] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[48] In 1987, A.J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[49] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Herv Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower.[50] Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor its \\"Countdown to the Year 2000\\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. Fireworks were set off all over it. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium On 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[53] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7?million visitors since 2003.[54] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[55] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe puddled iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons,[57] and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100?tons.[58] As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300?tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410?ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25?cm (2.46?in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8?tons per cubic metre.[59] Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324?m x 125?m x 125?m) would contain 6,200?tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18?cm (7?in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team ÿ experienced bridge builders ÿ understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony?  Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be  will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[62] All parts of the tower were over-designed to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[63] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9?centimetres (3.5?in) in the wind.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurantsone French, one Russian and one Flemishand an \\"Anglo-American Bar\\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. A promenade 2.6-metre (8?ft 6?in) wide ran around the outside of the first level. At the top, there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2016, an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in Paris in June. The apartment has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a lounge, and views of Paris landmarks including the Seine, the Sacre Coeur, and the Arc de Triomphe.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \\"invocation of science\\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986ÿ87 by the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, a company operating the tower.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky.[68] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \\"Eiffel Tower Brown\\".[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA pop-culture movie clich is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower.[71] In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintenance of the tower includes applying 60?tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearest Paris Mtro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[72] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Ina.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 250?million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[3] In 2015, there were 6.91?million visitors.[73] The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.[74] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has two restaurants: Le 58 Tour Eiffel on the first level, and Le Jules Verne, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It was run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse from 2007 to 2017.[76] Starting May 2019, it will be managed by three star chef Frdric Anton.[77] It owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne. Additionally, there is a champagne bar at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1?metres (518?ft) tall.[78] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the TV show Pricing the Priceless on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480?million to build.[81] Ironically, if accurate, that means that the replica would cost more than ten times that of the original (with the original costing nearly 8 million in 1890 Francs; ~US$40 million in 2018 dollars).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[82] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nA television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7?m (61.4?ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3?m (17.4?ft), giving the current height of 324?m (1,063?ft).[52] Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower and its image have long been in the public domain.[83] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \\"original visual creation\\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[84] The Socit d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[85] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[86][87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SNTE), Stphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \\"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\\".[88] SNTE made over ?1?million from copyright fees in 2002.[89] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,[90] a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out.[91] The tower has lost its standing both as the world's tallest structure and the world's tallest lattice tower but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France.","input":"When was the eiffel tower built and why?"},{"output":"about 40 million years ago","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCamelus glama Linnaeus,?1758\\r\\n\\r\\nThe llama (/?l?m?/; Spanish pronunciation:?[??ama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe height of a full-grown, full-size llama is 1.7 to 1.8?m (5.6 to 5.9?ft) tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between 130 and 200?kg (290 and 440?lb). At birth, a baby llama (called a cria) can weigh between 9 and 14?kg (20 and 31?lb). Llamas typically live for 15 to 25 years, with some individuals surviving 30 years or more.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are very social animals and live with other llamas as a herd. The wool produced by a llama is very soft and lanolin-free. Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions.

By the end of the last ice age (10,000ÿ12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America.[5] As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLamoids, or llamas (as they are more generally known as a group), consist of the vicu?a (Vicugna vicugna, prev. Lama vicugna), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), Suri alpaca, and Huacaya alpaca (Vicugna pacos, prev. Lama guanicoe pacos), and the domestic llama (Lama glama). Guanacos and vicu?as live in the wild, while alpacas ÿ as well as llamas ÿ exist only as domesticated animals.[8] Although early writers compared llamas to sheep, their similarity to the camel was soon recognized. They were included in the genus Camelus along with alpaca in the Systema Naturae (1758) of Carl Linnaeus.[9] They were, however, separated by Georges Cuvier in 1800 under the name of lama along with the guanaco.[10] Alpacas and vicu?as are in genus Vicugna. The genera Lama and Vicugna are, with the two species of true camels, the sole existing representatives of a very distinct section of the Artiodactyla or even-toed ungulates, called Tylopoda, or \\"bump-footed\\", from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet. The Tylopoda consist of a single family, the Camelidae, and shares the order Artiodactyla with the Suina (pigs), the Tragulina (chevrotains), the Pecora (ruminants), and the Whippomorpha (hippos and cetaceans, which belong to Artiodactyla from a cladistic, if not traditional, standpoint). The Tylopoda have more or less affinity to each of the sister taxa, standing in some respects in a middle position between them, sharing some characteristics from each, but in others showing special modifications not found in any of the other taxa.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th-century discoveries of a vast and previously unexpected extinct Paleogene fauna of North America, as interpreted by paleontologists Joseph Leidy, Edward Drinker Cope, and Othniel Charles Marsh, aided understanding of the early history of this family.[citation needed] Llamas were not always confined to South America; abundant llama-like remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in the Rocky Mountains and in Central America. Some of the fossil llamas were much larger than current forms. Some species remained in North America during the last ice ages. North American llamas are categorized as a single extinct genus, Hemiauchenia. Llama-like animals would have been a common sight 25,000 years ago, in modern-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Missouri, and Florida.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camelid lineage has a good fossil record. Camel-like animals have been traced from the thoroughly differentiated, modern species back through early Miocene forms. Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral artiodactyls.[citation needed] No fossils of these earlier forms have been found in the Old World, indicating that North America was the original home of camelids, and that Old World camels crossed over via the Bering Land Bridge. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to South America as part of the Great American Interchange, where they evolved further. Meanwhile, North American camelids died out at the end of the Pleistocene.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following characteristics apply especially to llamas. Dentition of adults:-incisors 1/3 canines 1/1, premolars 2/2, molars 3/2; total 32. In the upper jaw, a compressed, sharp, pointed laniariform incisor near the hinder edge of the premaxilla is followed in the male at least by a moderate-sized, pointed, curved true canine in the anterior part of the maxilla.[13] The isolated canine-like premolar that follows in the camels is not present. The teeth of the molar series, which are in contact with each other, consist of two very small premolars (the first almost rudimentary) and three broad molars, constructed generally like those of Camelus. In the lower jaw, the three incisors are long, spatulate, and procumbent; the outer ones are the smallest. Next to these is a curved, suberect canine, followed after an interval by an isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar; then a contiguous series of one premolar and three molars, which differ from those of Camelus in having a small accessory column at the anterior outer edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skull generally resembles that of Camelus, the larger brain-cavity and orbits and less-developed cranial ridges being due to its smaller size. The nasal bones are shorter and broader, and are joined by the premaxilla.\\r\\n\\r\\nVertebrae:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ears are rather long and slightly curved inward, characteristically known as \\"banana\\" shaped. There is no dorsal hump. The feet are narrow, the toes being more separated than in the camels, each having a distinct plantar pad. The tail is short, and fibre is long, woolly and soft.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn essential structural characteristics, as well as in general appearance and habits, all the animals of this genus very closely resemble each other, so whether they should be considered as belonging to one, two, or more species is a matter of controversy among naturalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is complicated by the circumstance of the great majority of individuals that have come under observation being either in a completely or partially domesticated state. Many are also descended from ancestors that have previously been domesticated, a state that tends to produce a certain amount of variation from the original type. The four forms commonly distinguished by the inhabitants of South America are recognized as distinct species, though with difficulties in defining their distinctive characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe llama and alpaca are only known in the domestic state, and are variable in size and of many colors, being often white, brown, or piebald. Some are grey or black. The guanaco and vicu?a are wild, the former being endangered, and of a nearly uniform light-brown color, passing into white below. They certainly differ from each other, the vicu?a being smaller, more slender in its proportions, and having a shorter head than the guanaco. The vicu?a lives in herds on the bleak and elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout Peru, in the southern part of Ecuador, and as far south as the middle of Bolivia. Its manners very much resemble those of the chamois of the European Alps; it is as vigilant, wild, and timid. The fiber is extremely delicate and soft, and highly valued for the purposes of weaving, but the quantity that each animal produces is minimal.\\r\\nAlpacas are descended from wild vicuna ancestors, while domesticated llamas are descended from wild guanaco ancestors, though a considerable amount of hybridization between the two species has occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferential characteristics between llamas and alpacas include the llama's larger size, longer head, and curved ears. Alpaca fiber is generally more expensive, but not always more valuable. Alpacas tend to have a more consistent color throughout the body. The most apparent visual difference between llamas and camels is that camels have a hump or humps and llamas do not.\\r\\n\\r\\nLlamas are not ruminants, pseudo-ruminants, or modified ruminants.[14] They have a complex stomach with several compartments that allows them to consume lower quality, high cellulose foods. The stomach compartments allow for fermentation of tough food stuffs, followed by regurgitation and re-chewing. Ruminants have four compartments (cows, sheep, goats), whereas llamas have only three stomach compartments: the rumen, omasum, and abomasum.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the llama (and other camelids) have an extremely long and complex large intestine (colon). The large intestine's role in digestion is to reabsorb water, vitamins and electrolytes from food waste that is passing through it. The length of the llama's colon allows it to survive on much less water than other animals. This is a major advantage in arid climates where they live.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nLlamas have an unusual reproductive cycle for a large animal. Female llamas are induced ovulators.[16] Through the act of mating, the female releases an egg and is often fertilized on the first attempt. Female llamas do not go into estrus (\\"heat\\").[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike humans, llama males and females mature sexually at different rates. Females reach puberty at about 12 months old; males do not become sexually mature until around three years of age.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nLlamas mate with the female in a kush (lying down) position, which is fairly unusual in a large animal. They mate for an extended time (20ÿ45 minutes), also unusual in a large animal.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gestation period of a llama is 11.5 months (350 days). Dams (female llamas) do not lick off their babies, as they have an attached tongue that does not reach outside of the mouth more than half an inch (1.3?cm). Rather, they will nuzzle and hum to their newborns.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nA cria (from Spanish for \\"baby\\") is the name for a baby llama, alpaca, vicu?a, or guanaco. Crias are typically born with all the females of the herd gathering around, in an attempt to protect against the male llamas and potential predators. Llamas give birth standing. Birth is usually quick and problem-free, over in less than 30 minutes. Most births take place between 8?am and noon, during the warmer daylight hours. This may increase cria survival by reducing fatalities due to hypothermia during cold Andean nights. This birthing pattern is speculated to be a continuation of the birthing patterns observed in the wild. Crias are up and standing, walking and attempting to suckle within the first hour after birth.[21][22][23] Crias are partially fed with llama milk that is lower in fat and salt and higher in phosphorus and calcium than cow or goat milk. A female llama will only produce about 60?ml (2.1?imp?fl?oz) of milk at a time when she gives milk, so the cria must suckle frequently to receive the nutrients it requires.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn harem mating, the male is left with females most of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor field mating, a female is turned out into a field with a male llama and left there for some period of time. This is the easiest method in terms of labor, but the least useful in terms of prediction of a likely birth date. An ultrasound test can be performed, and together with the exposure dates, a better idea of when the cria is expected can be determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nHand mating is the most efficient method, but requires the most work on the part of the human involved. A male and female llama are put into the same pen and mating is monitored. They are then separated and remated every other day until one or the other refuses the mating. Usually, one can get in two matings using this method, though some stud males routinely refuse to mate a female more than once. The separation presumably helps to keep the sperm count high for each mating and also helps to keep the condition of the female llama's reproductive tract more sound. If the mating is not successful within two to three weeks, the female is mated again.\\r\\n\\r\\nLlamas should be tested for pregnancy after mating at two to three, six and at least 12 weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpit testing with an intact male is generally free and is usually accurate. However, some hormonal conditions in females can make them reject a male when they are in fact not pregnant, and, more rarely, accept a male when they are pregnant. Progesterone tests can give a high reading in some females with a hormonal problem that are in fact not pregnant. Neither of the previous methods, nor palpation, can give a reasonably accurate idea of the age of the fetus, while an ultrasound procedure can. In addition, an ultrasound procedure can distinguish between pregnancy and misleading physical conditions, or between a live and dead fetus. The disadvantages of an ultrasound procedure are cost, some training in the use of ultrasound equipment is required, and not all veterinarians have the equipment needed to perform the examination.\\r\\n\\r\\nOptions for feeding llamas are quite wide; a wide variety of commercial and farm-based feeds are available. The major determining factors include feed cost, availability, nutrient balance and energy density required. Young, actively growing llamas require a greater concentration of nutrients than mature animals because of their smaller digestive tract capacities.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nLlamas, which are well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning, are very friendly and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become extremely difficult to handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen correctly reared, llamas spitting at a human is a rare thing. Llamas are very social herd animals, however, and do sometimes spit at each other as a way of disciplining lower-ranked llamas in the herd. A llama's social rank in a herd is never static. They can always move up or down in the social ladder by picking small fights. This is usually done between males to see which will become dominant. Their fights are visually dramatic, with spitting, ramming each other with their chests, neck wrestling and kicking, mainly to knock the other off balance. The females are usually only seen spitting as a means of controlling other herd members.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the social structure might always be changing, they live as a family and they do take care of each other. If one notices a strange noise or feels threatened, a warning bray is sent out and all others become alert. They will often hum to each other as a form of communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of the llama making groaning noises or going \\"mwa\\" (/mwa?/) is often a sign of fear or anger. If a llama is agitated, it will lay its ears back. One may determine how agitated the llama is by the materials in the spit. The more irritated the llama is, the further back into each of the three stomach compartments it will try to draw materials from for its spit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn \\"orgle\\" is the mating sound of a llama or alpaca, made by the sexually aroused male. The sound is reminiscent of gargling, but with a more forceful, buzzing edge. Males begin the sound when they become aroused and continue throughout the act of procreation ÿ from 15 minutes to more than an hour.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then.[30][31] They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.[32][better?source?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nScholar Alex Chepstow-Lusty has argued that the switch from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to widespread agriculture was only possible because of the use of llama dung as fertilizer.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Moche people frequently placed llamas and llama parts in the burials of important people, as offerings or provisions for the afterlife.[35] The Moche culture of pre-Columbian Peru depicted llamas quite realistically in their ceramics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Inca empire, llamas were the only beasts of burden, and many of the people dominated by the Inca had long traditions of llama herding. For the Inca nobility, the llama was of symbolic significance, and llama figures were often buried with the dead.[36]\\r\\nIn South America, llamas are still used as beasts of burden, as well as for the production of fiber and meat.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inca deity Urcuchillay was depicted in the form of a multicolored llama.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarl Troll has argued that the large numbers of llamas found in the southern Peruvian highlands were an important factor in the rise of the Inca Empire.[39] It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of alpacas and llamas in Pre-Hispanic America.[40] The link between the Andean biomes of puna and pramo, llama pastoralism and the Inca state is a matter of research.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main uses for llamas at the time of the Spanish conquest was to bring down ore from the mines in the mountains.[42] Gregory de Bolivar estimated that in his day, as many as 300,000 were employed in the transport of produce from the Potos mines alone, but since the introduction of horses, mules, and donkeys, the importance of the llama as a beast of burden has greatly diminished.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Juan Ignacio Molina, the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen observed the use of hueques (possibly a llama type) by native Mapuches of Mocha Island as plow animals in 1614.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chile hueque populations declined towards extinction in the 16th and 17th century being replaced by European livestock.[45] The causes of its extinction are not clear[45] but it is known that the introduction of sheep caused some competition among both domestic species.[46] Anecdotal evidence of the mid-17th century show that both species coexisted but suggests that there were many more sheep than hueques.[46] The decline of hueques reached a point in the late 18th century when only the Mapuche from Mariquina and Huequn next to Angol raised the animal.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nLlamas have a fine undercoat, which can be used for handicrafts and garments. The coarser outer guard hair is used for rugs, wall-hangings and lead ropes. The fiber comes in many different colors ranging from white or grey to reddish-brown, brown, dark brown and black.\\r\\n\\r\\n The dictionary definition of llama at Wiktionary","input":"When did the llama first appear in north america?"},{"output":"Mount Mitchell","context":"Mount Mitchell is the highest peak of the Appalachian Mountains and the highest peak in mainland eastern North America. It is located near Burnsville in Yancey County, North Carolina, in the Black Mountain subrange of the Appalachians, and about 19 miles (31?km) northeast of Asheville. It is protected by Mount Mitchell State Park and surrounded by the Pisgah National Forest. Mount Mitchell's elevation is 6,684 feet (2,037?m) above sea level.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peak is the highest mountain in the United States east of the Mississippi River, and the highest in all of eastern North America south of the Arctic Cordillera. The nearest higher peaks are in the Black Hills of South Dakota and the highland foothills of Colorado.\\r\\nThe mountain, previously known as Black Dome for its rounded shape, was named after Elisha Mitchell, a professor at the University of North Carolina, who first explored the Black Mountain region in 1835, and determined that the height of the range exceeded by several hundred feet that of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, commonly thought at the time to be the highest point east of the Rocky Mountains. Mitchell fell to his death at nearby Mitchell Falls in 1857, having returned to verify his earlier measurements.\\r\\nA 4.6-mile (7.4?km) road (NC 128) connects the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway to a parking lot where a steep paved 980-foot (300?m) trail leads through a conifer forest to the summit. The 40-foot (12?m) stone observation tower on the summit was torn down in late 2006. A new observation deck was constructed and opened to visitors in January 2009.[3] Also on the summit is the tomb of Dr. Mitchell.\\r\\nMount Mitchell was formed during the Precambrian when marine deposits were metamorphosed into gneiss and schist. These metasedimentary rocks were later uplifted during the Alleghenian orogeny.[4] The soils are well drained, dark brown and stony with fine-earth material ranging in texture from sandy clay loam to loam or sandy loam; Burton and Craggey are the most common series around the summit.[5]\\r\\nThe mountain's summit is coated in a dense stand of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest, which consists primarily of two evergreen species the red spruce and the Fraser fir. Most of the mature Fraser firs, however, were killed off by the non-native Balsam woolly adelgid in the latter half of the 20th century. The high elevations also expose plant life to high levels of pollution, including acid precipitation in the form of rain, snow, and fog. These acids damage the red spruce trees in part by releasing natural metals from the soil like aluminum, and by leaching important minerals. To what extent this pollution harms the high-altitude ecosystem is debatable.[7]\\r\\nWhile the mountain is still mostly lush and green in the summer, many dead Fraser fir trunks can be seen due to these serious problems. Repairing the damage is a difficult issue, as the pollutants are often carried in from long distances. Sources can be local or hundreds of miles or kilometers away, requiring cooperation from as far away as the Midwest.\\r\\nWildflowers are abundant all summer long. Young fir and spruce trees do well in the subalpine climate, and their pine cones feed the birds along with wild blueberry and blackberry shrubs.\\r\\nThe second highest point in eastern North America, Mount Craig at 6,647 feet (2,026?m), is roughly a mile to the north of Mount Mitchell.\\r\\nThe summit area of Mount Mitchell is marked by a humid continental climate (K?ppen Dfb) bordering extremely close to a subalpine climate (k?ppen climate classification Dfc), with mild summers and long, moderately cold winters, being more similar to southeastern Canada than the southeastern U.S.. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 25.2?F (?3.8?C) in January to 59.1?F (15.1?C) in July. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the state occurred there on January 21, 1985 when it fell to ?34?F (?37?C), during a severe cold spell that brought freezing temperatures as far south as Miami. It is also the coldest average reporting station in the state at 43.8?F (6.6?C) (based on data collected from 1971 to 2000) which is well below any other station.[8] Unlike the lower elevations in the surrounding regions, heavy snows often fall from December to March, with 50 inches (127?cm) accumulating in the Great Blizzard of 1993 and 66 inches (168?cm) in the January 2016 blizzard.[9][8] Snow flurries have been reported on the summit even in the summer months of June, July, and August. Due to the high elevation, precipitation is heavy and reliable year-round, averaging 74.7 inches (1,900?mm) for the year, with no month receiving less than 5?in (127?mm) of average precipitation.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" ÿ part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor ÿ has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than $1.8 billion.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[4] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[5]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[6]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[7]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[8]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[9]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[10]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[11]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[12] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[13][14]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of bold geometric forms and dynamic cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [15]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.[16] Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[17]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[18]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[19] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[20][21]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[22] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[23] Janis Joplin (2009),[24] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[25] and Chuck Berry (2012).[26]\\r\\n Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[27][28] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[29] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", both released in 2006.[30] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 655ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[31][32][33]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[34]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[35]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[36]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[37]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[38][39][40]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[41] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[42][43] but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[44]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[45]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[45]\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[41] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[46] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[47] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[48]\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[49] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[49] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[50]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[51]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[52][53] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[54] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[55]\\r\\n2016 inductee Steve Miller voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.[56]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[48]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[57] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[58]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[59]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[60] NPR radio,[61] The Christian Science Monitor,[62] Goldmine magazine,[63][64] Yahoo Music[65] and MSNBC [66] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"When was the rock and roll hall of fame started?"},{"output":"larger","context":"The Connecticut Compromise (also known as the Great Compromise of 1787 or Sherman Compromise) was an agreement that large and small states reached during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that in part defined the legislative structure and representation that each state would have under the United States Constitution. It retained the bicameral legislature as proposed by Roger Sherman, along with proportional representation of the states in the lower house, but required the upper house to be weighted equally between the states. Each state would have two representatives in the upper house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 29, 1787, Edmund Randolph of the Virginia delegation proposed the creation of a bicameral legislature. Under his proposal, membership in both houses would be allocated to each state proportional to its population; however, candidates for the lower house would be nominated and elected by the people of each state. This proposal allowed fairness and equality to the people. Candidates for the upper house would be nominated by the state legislatures of each state and then elected by the members of the lower house. This proposal was known as the Virginia Plan.\\r\\nLess populous states like Delaware were afraid that such an arrangement would result in their voices and interests being drowned out by the larger states. Many delegates also felt that the Convention did not have the authority to completely scrap the Articles of Confederation,[1] as the Virginia Plan would have.[2] In response, on June 15, 1787, William Paterson of the New Jersey delegation proposed a legislature consisting of a single house. Each state was to have equal representation in this body, regardless of population. The New Jersey Plan, as it was called, would have left the Articles of Confederation in place, but would have amended them to somewhat increase Congress's powers.[3]\\r\\nAt the time of the convention, the South was growing more quickly than the North, and Southern states had the most extensive Western claims. South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia were small in the 1780s, but they expected growth, and thus favored proportional representation. New York was one of the largest states at the time, but two of its three representatives (Alexander Hamilton being the exception) supported an equal representation per state, as part of their desire to see maximum autonomy for the states. (The two representatives other than Hamilton had left the convention before the representation issue was resolved, leaving Hamilton, and New York state, without a vote.)\\r\\nJames Madison and Hamilton were two of the leaders of the proportional representation group. Madison argued that a conspiracy of large states against the small states was unrealistic as the large states were so different from each other. Hamilton argued that the states were artificial entities made up of individuals, and accused small state representatives of wanting power, not liberty (see History of the United States Senate).\\r\\nFor their part, the small state representatives argued that the states were, in fact, of a legally equal status, and that proportional representation would be unfair to their states. Gunning Bedford, Jr. of Delaware notoriously threatened on behalf of the small states, \\"the small ones w[ould] find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them justice.\\"\\r\\nElbridge Gerry ridiculed the small states claim of sovereignty, saying that we never were independent States, were not such now, & never could be even on the principles of the Confederation. The States & the advocates for them were intoxicated with the idea of their sovereignty.[4]\\r\\nOn June 14, when the Convention was ready to consider the report on the Virginia plan, William Paterson of New Jersey requested an adjournment to allow certain delegations more time to prepare a substitute plan. The request was granted, and, on the next day, Paterson submitted nine resolutions embodying necessary amendments to the Articles of Confederation, which was followed by a vigorous debate. On June 19, the delegates rejected the New Jersey Plan and voted to proceed with a discussion of the Virginia Plan. The small States became increasingly discontented, and some threatened to withdraw. On July 2, the Convention was deadlocked over giving each State an equal vote in the upper house, with five States in the affirmative, five in the negative, and one divided.\\r\\nThe problem was referred to a committee consisting of one delegate from each State to reach a compromise. On July 5, the committee submitted its report, which became the basis for the Great Compromise\\" of the Convention. The report recommended that in the upper house each State should have an equal vote and in the lower house, each State should have one representative for every 40,000 inhabitants,[5] counting slaves as three-fifths of an inhabitant,[5] and that money bills should originate in the lower house (not subject to amendment by the upper chamber).\\r\\nAfter six weeks of turmoil, North Carolina switched its vote to equal representation per state and Massachusetts abstained, and a compromise was reached, being called the \\"Great Compromise.\\" In the \\"Great Compromise,\\" every state was given equal representation, previously known as the New Jersey Plan, in one house of Congress, and proportional representation, known before as the Virginia Plan, in the other. Because it was considered more responsive to majority sentiment, the House of Representatives was given the power to originate all legislation dealing with the federal budget and revenues/taxation, per the Origination Clause.\\r\\nRoger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, both of the Connecticut delegation, created a compromise that, in a sense, blended the Virginia (large-state) and New Jersey (small-state) proposals regarding congressional apportionment. Ultimately, however, its main contribution was in determining the apportionment of the Senate. Sherman sided with the two-house national legislature of the Virginia Plan but proposed \\"That the proportion of suffrage in the 1st. Branch [house] should be according to the respective numbers of free inhabitants; and that in the second branch or Senate, each State should have one vote and no more.\\"[6] Although Sherman was well liked and respected among the delegates, his plan failed at first. It was not until July 23 that representation was finally settled.[6]\\r\\nWhat was ultimately included in the constitution was a modified form of this plan, partly because the larger states disliked it. In committee, Benjamin Franklin modified Sherman's proposal to make it more acceptable to the larger states. He added the requirement that revenue bills originate in the house.\\r\\nThe final July 16 vote on the Connecticut Compromise left the Senate looking to the Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison, King, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed the compromise for this reason.[7] For the nationalists, the Conventions vote for the compromise was a stunning defeat. However, on July 23, they found a way to salvage their vision of an elite, independent Senate. Just before most of the conventions work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state representatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as they had in the Confederation Congress. Then Oliver Ellsworth, a leading proponent of the Connecticut Compromise, supported their motion, and the Convention adopted it.[8] As the Convention had early acquiesced in the Virginia Plans proposal that senators have long terms, restoring that Plans vision of individually powerful senators stopped the Senate from becoming a strong safeguard of federalism. State governments lost their direct say in Congresss decisions to make national laws. As the personally influential senators received terms much longer than the state legislators who appointed them, they became substantially independent. The compromise nonetheless continued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who were assured of access to more seats in the Senate than they might otherwise have obtained.[9]\\r\\nSenate representation was explicitly protected in Article Five of the United States Constitution:\\r\\n...no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.[10]\\r\\nThis agreement allowed deliberations to continue, and thus led to the Three-Fifths Compromise, which further complicated the issue of popular representation in the House.","input":"What type of states did the virginia plan benefit?"},{"output":"fifth generation","context":"Apple TV is a digital media player and microconsole developed and sold by Apple Inc.

It also supports 1080p content from iTunes and Netflix.[18] On January 28, 2013, Apple released a third generation \\"Rev A\\" which included component changes.\\r\\nOn March 9, 2015, Apple reduced the price of the third generation (Rev A) Apple TV to $69.\\r\\nOn October 4, 2016, 9to5Mac reported that Apple had phased out the Apple TV 3, with Apple Store employees instructed to pull all units and demo units from store shelves. Shortly afterwards, Apple took down the purchase page for the Apple TV 3 from its website, with the link redirecting to the purchase page for the Apple TV 4.[19]\\r\\nOn September 9, 2015, Apple announced the fourth generation Apple TV, to ship in October 2015. It is the first major update to the platform since the release of the second generation Apple TV on September 1, 2010. Tim Cook took the stage and said \\"The future of TV is apps\\". He also stated that the Apple TV needed a modern OS. While matching the form factor of the 2nd and 3rd generation models, it is significantly taller. Featuring a new touch remote allowing swipe-to-select functionality instead of the old remote's arrow button, with integrated Siri support with a built in microphone and an accelerometer (IMU). The Siri button on the remote allows several functions, including searching across providers for content, accessing additional metadata, and video/audio controls.\\r\\nThe 4th generation also uses a new operating system, tvOS, with an associated app store, allowing download of third-party apps for video, audio, games, and other content ÿ initially from a limited range of providers on release, with others able to release further apps using new APIs allowing them to do so. A requirement of these apps and games is that they all must include interfacing with the new touchpad-enabled Siri remote.[20] Craig Federighi said that tvOS is 95% based on iOS 9 with the interface and APIs being tweaked to support the big screen.\\r\\nUpon launch, there were several unexpected issues which included incompatibility with Apple's Remote app for iOS and watchOS,[21] which were fixed by Apple in December 2015.\\r\\nAs Amazon's Fire TV competes directly with the Apple TV, Amazon initially declined to develop an Amazon Video application for the Apple TV, and declined to sell the 4th generation Apple TV, along with removing all 3rd generation SKUs in late October 2015.[22] Amazon reversed their stance, and released their app in late 2017,[23] and has stated that the Apple TV will be sold on Amazon as well.[24]\\r\\nOn September 13, 2016, Apple released the tvOS 10 software update for the Apple TV, bringing an all new remote app, single-sign on, dark mode, HomeKit support, and many more features to the 4th generation Apple TV.\\r\\nOn September 12, 2017, Apple announced the fifth generation Apple TV, named Apple TV 4K, which supports 2160p output, HDR10, Dolby Vision, and includes a faster Apple A10X Fusion processor. Externally it is similar to the fourth generation model, with the only differences being the addition of vents on the base, the removal of the USB-C port, and the addition of a white outline around the menu button on the included Siri Remote. Following the announcement of the new models, the 64GB version of the fourth generation Apple TV was discontinued.[25]\\r\\nApple TV allows consumers to use an HDTV to stream video, music, and podcasts as well as downloading apps and games from the tvOS App Store. The first, second, and third generations offered limited content which Apple had provisioned to work with Apple TV. These have now been discontinued[26] in favor of the fourth generation Apple TV, with an OS based on iOS called tvOS which lets developers create their own apps with their own interface that run on Apple TV. These include multimedia, music apps, and games.\\r\\nFeatures of Apple TV Include:\\r\\nSince tvOS and watchOS are based on iOS, they have inherited many of the accessibility features of iOS and macOS and are compatible with Apple's entire product line including the Apple Watch as a remote controller for the Apple TV.\\r\\ntvOS includes the Apple technologies of VoiceOver, Zoom, and Siri to help the blind and those with low vision. VoiceOver, Apples screen reader is available for more than 30 languages and enables visually impaired users to know what is on the visual display and input responses to on-screen prompts. VoiceOver gestures uses gestures that Apple users are already familiar with in other Apple Products (flicks, taps, and the rotor) making the Apple TV familiar to the disabled in a way akin to how Apple designs their products to have a fit and finish consistency across product lines be it familiarity with OS X on a Macintosh, watchOS on an Apple Watch, or the iOS operating system on iPhones, iPads or iPods.\\r\\nLike other Apple products such as the iPhone with a three click sequence on the home button to activate accessibility features, with Apple TV's tvOS, the disabled user can activate VoiceOver without any installation process. One needs only to triple-click the Menu button on the Siri Remote and the Apple TV will guide the user through the complete initial setup, a task that is non-trivial to the visually impaired in most comparable products on the market.\\r\\nAnother accessibility feature is to Increase contrast on the screen which acts by reducing the transparency of background elements on Movie and TV Show pages, menu tabs, and other parts of the operating system. The visually impaired can also turn on a high-contrast cursor to better delineate the focused content. The user can also opt to turn on Reduce Motion which in some screen actions, such as moving between app icons on the Home screen and launching apps are visually simpler which is of benefit to reduce strain on the eyes.\\r\\ntvOS enables users to watch movies with audio descriptions of what is being shown on the screen. Movies with audio descriptions are displayed with the AD (Audio Description) icon in the iTunes Store for tvOS and in iTunes on a Macintosh or Windows PC.\\r\\nPairing a Bluetooth keyboard with the tvOS on the Apple TV enables another accessibility feature that also is an incorporation of VoiceOver. When typing, VoiceOver mirrors with an audio voice, each character pressed on the keyboard and repeated again when it is entered. The Apple TV is designed to work with the Apple Wireless Keyboard or the Apple Magic Keyboard. It will work with almost any brand of bluetooth keyboard.\\r\\nApple TV with and without tvOS supports closed captioning, so the deaf or hard of hearing can experience TV episodes and feature-length movies. Compatible episodes and movies are denoted with a CC (closed captioning) or SDH (Descriptive Audio) icon in the iTunes Store either on the Apple TV or in iTunes itself. The viewer can customize the captions in episodes or movies with styles and fonts that are more conducive to their hearing and/or visual impairment.\\r\\nThe Touch surface on the Siri Remote is customizable. Tracking when setting to Fast adjusts the thumb movements made to amplify the distance in relation to how far the thumb has moved on the glass touchpad. Conversely when tracking is set to slow, larger movements of the thumb on the touchpad will tune down the distance that is traversed on the screen. This can be of great help to those struggling with Parkinson's or other movement disorders to be able to use the Apple TV in a way that fits their disability.\\r\\nApple's Remote app on iOS devices allows control of the Apple TV from an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. The iOS remote app increases the accessibility of the Apple TV by enabling Switch Control. Switch Control is a unique Apple technology that enables navigation sequentially through onscreen items and perform specific actions such as selecting, tapping, dragging, typing using third party Bluetooth-enabled switch hardware made for those with handicaps.\\r\\nSimilar to Google's redesign of YouTube, Apple has restricted access to most viewed charts on movies and podcasts. They are replaced by \\"Top Movies\\", \\"Top Podcasts\\" and \\"Editor's Picks\\". User may be under the impression that a \\"Top\\" media is equivalent of most popular or most watched.\\r\\nParental controls allow consumers to limit access to Internet media service content via \\"Restrictions\\" settings; individual services can be turned off (e.g., to reduce clutter), icons can be rearranged via the tap-and-hold technique  la iOS. Internet media is split into four categories: \\"Internet Photos\\", \\"YouTube\\", \\"Podcasts\\", and \\"Purchase and Rental\\". Each of the categories is configured by a parental control of \\"Show\\", \\"Hide\\" or \\"Ask\\" to prompt for a 4-digit PIN. In addition, movies, TV shows, music and podcasts can be restricted by rating.[34]\\r\\nApple TV can sync or stream photos, music and videos from a computer running iTunes.[35]\\r\\nA user can connect a computer on a local network to maintain a central home media library of digitized CD, DVD or HD content,[36] provide direct connectivity to photo organization software such as iPhoto,[37] limit home video access to a local network only,[38] play Internet radio,[39][40] or preload content on Apple TV to be used later as a non-networked video player.[41] For users who wish to connect the Apple TV to a computer, synchronization and streaming modes are supported.[35]\\r\\nApple TV in synchronization mode works in a way similar to the iPod. It is paired with an iTunes library on a single computer and can synchronize with that library, copying all or selected content to its own storage. Apple TV need not remain connected to the network after syncing.[41][42] Photos can be synced from iPhoto, Aperture, or from a folder on a Mac, or Adobe Photoshop Album, Photoshop Elements, or from a hard disk folder in Windows.[43]\\r\\nApple TV can also function as a peer-to-peer digital media player, streaming content from iTunes libraries and playing the content over the network.[44][45]\\r\\n1st generation Apple TVs can stream content from up to five computers or iTunes libraries. Also, five Apple TVs can be linked to the same iTunes library. The 2nd generation Apple TV onwards allows users to stream content from more than one iTunes library: these additional iTunes libraries can be on the same or on different computers. This is possible when Apple TV and every iTunes library from which you want to stream content meet all of the following conditions: (1) the Apple TV and the iTunes library you are streaming from are both on the same local network, (2) each uses the iTunes \\"Home Sharing\\" feature, and (3) each are using the same \\"Home Sharing\\" Apple ID.\\r\\nApple TV natively supports the following audio, video, and picture formats (although with the 4th generation, apps may use alternative built-in software in order to play other codecs and formats, e.g. Plex/ VLC media player):\\r\\nVideo\\r\\nPicture\\r\\nAudio\\r\\nTV compatibility\\r\\nAttempts to sync unsupported content to Apple TV will draw an error message from iTunes.[52]\\r\\nThe 1st and 2nd generation Apple TV video output can be set to either 1080i or 1080p; however, this resolution is limited to the user interface and the viewing of photographs?ÿ all other content is simply upscaled to those resolutions. Those models cannot play 1080i or 1080p video content (e.g., HD camera video).[44][45][53][54][55] The 3rd and 4th generation Apple TV support 1080p video content.\\r\\nApple offers H.264 1080p movies and video podcasts on iTunes.[56] In comparison, Blu-ray Disc films are 1080p H.264 or VC-1 video encoded at rates of up to 40 Mbit/s.[57]\\r\\nApple TV's audio chip supports 7.1 surround sound,[58] and some high definition rentals from iTunes are offered with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.[59]\\r\\nThere is an Apple TV export option in QuickTime which allows content in some formats that the device does not support to be easily re-encoded.[60] Applications that use QuickTime to export media can use this; e.g., iMovie's Share menu,[61] iTunes' advanced menu,[62] and some third-party content conversion tools.[63]\\r\\nApple TV streams video through an HDMI cable (Type A) connected to the TV's HDMI port. Audio is supported through the optical or HDMI ports. The device also has a Micro-USB port, which is reserved for service and diagnostics. The device connects through Ethernet or Wi-Fi to the computer for digital content from the Internet and local networks. Apple TV does not come with audio, video or other cables, which must be acquired additionally as required.[64] On the previous Apple TV, media files could be transferred directly onto the device by syncing with another computer. Once content was stored on the device's hard drive, Internet connectivity was no longer needed to view content.[41] This is not the case with the current model, which does not have a hard drive for storing media.\\r\\nThe 1st generation Apple TV had component video and RCA connector audio ports, both removed in the 2nd generation. The device does not have RCA/composite video or F/RF connectors.[45][65]\\r\\nStarting with the 4th generation Apple TV, Apple removed the optical audio port. Apple also enhanced the HDMI port by adding support for HDMI 1.4. The Micro-USB port was removed in favor of the reversible USB-C port.\\r\\nAirPlay allows iOS devices or an AirPort-enabled computer with the iTunes music player to send a stream of music to multiple (three to six, in typical conditions) stereos connected to an AirPort Express (the audio-only antecedent of Apple TV) or Apple TV.[66]\\r\\nThe AirPort Express' streaming media capabilities use Apple's Remote Audio Output Protocol (RAOP), a proprietary variant of RTSP/RTP. Using WDS-bridging,[67] the AirPort Express can allow AirPlay functionality (as well as Internet access, file and print sharing, etc.) across a larger distance in a mixed environment of wired and up to 10 wireless clients.\\r\\nSpeakers attached to an AirPort Express or Apple TV can be selected from within the \\"Remote\\" iPhone/iPod Touch program, allowing full AirPlay compatibility[68] (see \\"Remote control\\" section below).\\r\\nA compatible Mac running OS X Mountain Lion or later can wirelessly mirror its screen to an Apple TV through AirPlay Mirroring[69] while one running OS X Mavericks or later can also extend its display with AirPlay Display.\\r\\nApple TV can be controlled by many infrared remote controls[70] or paired with the included Apple Remote to prevent interference from other remotes.[44][71][72] Either kind of remote can control playback volume, but for music only.[10][73][74]\\r\\nThe Apple Wireless Keyboard is supported on the 2nd generation Apple TV and later using the built-in Bluetooth.[75] The consumer has the ability to control media playback, navigate menus and input text and other information. Third-party keyboards that use the Apple layout may also be compatible.[75]\\r\\nOn July 10, 2008, Apple released Remote, a free iOS application that allows the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad to control the iTunes library on the Apple TV via Wi-Fi.[76][77] The recently released Apple Watch also has a remote app to control Apple TV.[78]\\r\\nThe Remote App was updated on September 13, 2016, to take advantage of all the features of the Apple TV 4. This includes Siri, Touchpad, and Home Buttons, along with a now playing screen.\\r\\nOn September 9, 2015, Apple announced the new Siri Remote for the 4th generation Apple TV (although in some territories, Apple have kept the name Apple TV Remote, due to Siri functionality not being enabled on it in that territory).[79] It is a completely redesigned remote that features dual microphones for Siri support and a glass touch surface for navigation around the interface by swiping or tapping and scrubbing to fast forward or rewind. Also, it has a menu and home button, a Siri button to invoke Siri, a Play/Pause button, and a Volume Up/Down button to control the volume on the TV. The Siri Remote will communicate with the Apple TV via Bluetooth rather than infrared, and thus doesn't require a line-of-sight with the device. This new remote is only supported by the 4th generation Apple TV and later and will not work with earlier generations.\\r\\nBeginning with the 4th generation Apple TV, the remote includes two microphones and a button to toggle on Siri. Siri on the Apple TV has all of the functions of Siri on iOS 9; it can also respond to requests specifically for the TV. For instance, the viewer can ask Siri to search for a TV show or movie and it will search across multiple different sources to tell the user where the content is available to watch. It can also do things such as Play/Pause, Rewind/Fast Forward, skip back 15 seconds and temporarily turn on captioning when asked \\"what did he say?\\" or \\"what did she say?\\", open a specific app, and more.\\r\\nThe original Apple TV ran a modified build of Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger[80]\\r\\nApple TV Software 1.0:\\r\\nApple TV software 1.0 presented the user with an interface similar to that of Front Row. Like Front Row on the Mac, it presents the user with seven options for consuming content. Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Settings, and Sources.\\r\\nApple TV Software 2.0:\\r\\nIn February 2008, Apple released a major and free upgrade to the Apple TV, labelled \\"Take Two\\"(2.0). This update did away with Front Row and introduced a new interface in which content was organized into six categories, all of which appeared in a large square box on the screen upon startup (movies, TV shows, music, YouTube, podcasts, and photos) and presented in the initial menu, along with a \\"Settings\\" option for configuration, including software updates.[81][82]\\r\\nApple TV Software 3.0:\\r\\nIn October 2009, Apple released a minor upgrade for the Apple TV called \\"Apple TV Software 3.0\\". This update replaced the interface in version 2.0 with a new interface which presented seven horizontal columns across the top of the screen for the different categories of content (Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Internet, and Settings). This update also added features such as content filtering, iTunes Extras, new fonts, and a new Internet radio app. The maximum resolution increased in both the 40 GB and 160 GB version to include 1080P.\\r\\nThe 2nd and 3rd generation Apple TVs run a version of iOS, rather than the modified Mac OS X of the original model.\\r\\nThe interface on Apple TV OS 4 is similar to that of previous versions, with only minor changes and feature additions throughout. In March 2012, Apple released a major new software update, with the Apple TV 3, labeled as Apple TV OS 5 (iOS 5.1), which shipped with the new 3rd generation Apple TV. This update completely revised the look of the home screen to make it resemble the icon grid seen on iOS. Instead of 7 columns, content and third-party channels are shown in a tiled grid format, which can be rearranged. Throughout the years, for Apple TV OS 5-6, Apple released minor revisions, content additions, and feature updates.\\r\\nThe Apple TV OS 7.0 features a flat look similar to iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite and adds features such as Peer-To-Peer AirPlay. Version 8.0 was skipped.\\r\\nThe final OS update for the third-generation Apple TV is Apple TV software 7.2.2 (iOS 8.4.2) since it does not support tvOS 9.0 or later.\\r\\nThe fourth generation Apple TV and later run an operating system called tvOS which does not support the earlier generations of Apple TV. It features an app store, allowing third-party app developers to release their own apps on the platform.[83] Also, this new software features support for Siri voice control. Craig Federighi mentioned that tvOS is based 95% on iOS 9 and the rest being adaptions to optimize it for the TV. The tvOS software development kit (SDK) for developing tvOS apps is included in Xcode 7.1 and later.[84] A new development feature, App Thinning, is used in the Apple TV, running on tvOS, due to the memory restrictions of the device (32GB and 64GB) and the dual-use of the NAND Flash Memory to precache movies from Apple's content servers as well as storage for downloaded applications from the tvOS App Store. Apple's aim is to limit the size of application downloads and steering users towards downloading individual segments of apps in order to better manage storage space. Developers have reacted with criticism towards the download size limits, arguing that it leads to situations where game data is purged and has to be re-downloaded.[85]\\r\\nApple TV does not contain a TV tuner, nor a personal video recorder.[44][52] Both capabilities can be applied to the connected home computer through various third-party products, such as allowing PVR software to connect to iTunes and enable scheduled HDTV recordings to play automatically via Apple TV for playback.[103]\\r\\nThe Front Row interface lacks some iTunes functionality, including rating items, checking the account balance, adding funds to the account, synchronizing from more than one computer,[104] full Internet radio support,[45][105] and games.[106]\\r\\nThe Movies search box only searches the iTunes Store, not local hard drives and networks.[107]\\r\\nMovies rented on Apple TV must be watched on Apple TV, unlike iTunes rentals, which can be transferred to any video-enabled iPod, iPhone or Apple TV.[108][109] Movies purchased on Apple TV can be moved to a video-enabled iPod or iPhone via iTunes.[110]\\r\\nApple TV prior to 4th generation does not support the HDMI Consumer Electronics Control (HDMI CEC) protocol.\\r\\nOn the Apple TV (2nd generation), digital output audio is up-sampled to 48?kHz, including lossless CD rips at 44.1?kHz. Although this is a higher frequency and the difference is not audible in most cases, it means the audio is not 'bit perfect' which is often a goal for digital transmission of data.[111]\\r\\nWithin the first week of presales in January 2007, Apple TV was the top pre-selling item at the Apple Store.[112] Orders exceeded 100,000 units by the end of January and Apple began ramping-up to sell over a million units before the 2007 holiday season.[113] Analysts began calling it a \\"DVD killer\\"[114] that could enable multiple services. Analysts also predicted that Apple could sell up to 1.5?million units in the first year.[115] Besides the Apple Store, Best Buy was one of the first retailers to carry the device;[116] Target and Costco[117] followed shortly thereafter.\\r\\nTwo months into sales, Forrester Research predicted that Apple would only sell a million Apple TV units, because consumers prefer advertisement-supported content over paid content. Forrester predicted that cable companies would be the clear winners over content providers such as the iTunes Store.[118] Shortly after, Apple released YouTube functionality and Jobs stated that Apple TV was a \\"DVD player for the Internet\\". Some market analysts predicted that YouTube on Apple TV \\"provides a glimpse of this product's potential and its future evolution\\",[119] but overall, analysts had mixed reactions regarding the future of Apple TV. Some negative reactions followed after Jobs referred to the device as a \\"hobby\\", implying it was less significant than the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone.[120]\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, sales were triple that of the fourth quarter of 2007.[121]\\r\\nIn Apple's first-quarter 2009 financial results conference call, acting chief executive Tim Cook stated that Apple TV sales increased three times over the same quarter a year ago. Cook mentioned that the movie rental business was working well for Apple, Apple would continue investment in movie rentals and Apple TV, but Apple TV is still considered a hobby for the company.[121] Due to the growth of digital TV and consumers turning to Internet media services, an analyst predicted sales of 6.6 million Apple TVs by the end of 2009.[122]\\r\\nThe second generation sold 250,000 units in the first two weeks it was available. On December 21, 2010, Apple announced that they had sold 1 million units.[123] In the second fiscal quarter of 2011, it had topped 2 million in total sales, with 820,000 sold in that quarter alone.[124]\\r\\nOn January 24, 2012, Apple announced they had sold 1.4 million units in the first fiscal quarter of 2012,[125] and 2.8 million units in all of fiscal year 2011.[126] (4.2 million units through January 1, 2012).\\r\\nTim Cook revealed at the All Things Digital conference in May 2012 that Apple had sold 2.7 million of the 3rd generation model in 2012.[127]\\r\\nIn the Q4 FY2012 earnings call, Engadget reported comments from Tim Cook that Apple had shipped 1.3 million Apple TV units in the 4th Quarter (presumed to be 3rd generation).[128]\\r\\nMacObserver reported statements by Tim Cook in the Q1 FY2013 earnings call that Apple sold over 2 million Apple TV units in the December Quarter (presumed to be 3rd generation).[129]\\r\\nThese reports lead to a cumulative volume of the 3rd generation device of 6 million units, as of January 1, 2013.\\r\\nOn February 28, 2014 at Apple's shareholders meeting Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that in 2013 Apple TV brought in 1 billion dollars of revenue for Apple[130]\\r\\nA market survey published by Parks Associates in December 2014 found that Apple TV has lost consumer traction to Google Chromecast, garnering only a 17% market share.[131]\\r\\nTim Cook revealed at the Apple Watch conference on March 9, 2015 that Apple had sold a total of 25 million Apple TVs to date.[132]\\r\\nIn the January 27, 2016 Apple earnings call, CEO Tim Cook stated that the Apple TV had record sales. However, no specific sales figures were mentioned; Apple TV is included in an \\"Other products\\" category, which also includes the Apple Watch, iPods, and Beats products, and is not broken down by individual products.[133]\\r\\n1 ÿ Still in operation, but no longer offers cable or Internet as part of its services","input":"What is the latest version of apple tv?"},{"output":"In 1968","context":"Subway is an American privately held fast food restaurant franchise that primarily sells submarine sandwiches (subs) and salads. Subway is one of the fastest-growing franchises in the world[2] and, as of June 2017, has approximately 45,000 stores located in more than 100 countries. More than half of the stores are located in the United States.[1][3][4] It is the largest single-brand restaurant chain and the largest restaurant operator in the world.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], the Subway Group of companies is organized as follows. Subway IP Inc. is the owner of the intellectual property for the restaurant system. Franchise World Headquarters, LLC leads franchising operations. FWH Technologies, LLC owns and licenses Subway's point of sale software. Franchisors include Doctor's Associates Inc. in the U.S.; Subway International B.V.; Subway Franchise Systems of Canada, Ltd.; etc. Advertising affiliates include Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust, Ltd.; Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust, B.V.; Subway Franchisee Canadian Advertising Trust; etc.[9][10]\\r\\nSubway's international headquarters are in Milford, Connecticut, with five regional centers supporting the company's international operations. The regional offices for European franchises are located in Amsterdam (Netherlands); the Australian and New Zealand locations are supported from Brisbane (Australia); the Asian locations are supported from offices in Beirut (Lebanon) and Singapore; and the Latin American support center is in Miami.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Fred DeLuca borrowed $1,000 from friend Peter Buck to start \\"Pete's Super Submarines\\" in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and in the following year, they formed Doctor's Associates Inc. to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded.[12][13] The holding company derives its name from DeLuca's goal to earn enough from the business to pay tuition for medical school, as well as Buck's having a doctorate in physics.[14] Doctor's Associates is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, any medical organization.[15] In 1968, the sandwich shop was renamed \\"Subway\\".[12]\\r\\nThe first Subway on the West Coast was opened in Fresno, California, in 1978.[16] The first Subway outside of North America opened in Bahrain in December 1984.[17] The first Subway in the United Kingdom was opened in Brighton in 1996.[18] In 2004, Subway began opening stores in Walmart supercenters and surpassed the number of McDonald's locations inside U.S. Walmart stores in 2007.[19]\\r\\nSince 2007, Subway has consistently ranked in Entrepreneur magazine's Top 500 Franchises list. It ranked #2 in 2012. It also ranked #2 on the \\"Fastest Growing Franchise\\" and \\"Global Franchise\\" lists.[20] At the end of 2010, Subway became the largest fast food chain worldwide, with 33,749 restaurants?ÿ 1,012 more than McDonald's.[21]\\r\\nIn January 2015, Suzanne Greco took over the running of Subway from her brother Fred DeLuca, who had been CEO, but had been ill with leukemia for two years (he died in September 2015), and became president and CEO.[22][23]\\r\\nIn 2016, Subway closed hundreds of restaurants in the U.S., experiencing a net loss in locations for the first time. However, with 26,744 locations, it remained the most ubiquitous restaurant chain in the U.S. (with McDonald's in the #2 spot).[24] Also in 2016, Subway announced a new logo for the franchise, to be implemented in 2017.[25] On July 17, 2017, Subway unveiled redesigned restaurants, dubbed \\"Fresh Forward.\\" Features include self-order kiosks; USB charging ports at tables; and new menu items, including additional condiments, and bread made without gluten. The company is piloting the changes at 12 locations across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with many features expected to be implemented into stores worldwide by the end of 2017.[26]\\r\\nIn 2017, the chain closed more than 800 of its U.S. locations. In April 2018, the chain announced it would close about 500 more that year. According Abha Bhattarai of The Washington Post, this is a result of three consecutive years of falling profits, and foot traffic in Subway stores reduced by 25 percent since 2012. Franchisees also complained that the company's deep promotions further ate away at profits. Industry analysts like Bob Phibbs, chief executive of the new York-based consulting firm Retail Doctor, say changing tastes on the part of consumers, who more frequently prefer locally sourced produce and hormone-free meat served by regional start-ups like Sweetgreen, especially in Metropolitan areas, are the cause of the drop in Subway's sales, as well as loss of market share to competitors. These include fast-casual eateries and sandwich shops like Panera Bread, Au Bon Pain and Firehouse Subs, as well as food trucks, and grocery stores that offer freshly made meals at competitive prices. In January 2018, Subway invested $25 million in a re-branding campaign targeted at young consumers in order to revitalize its image and boost sales.[13]\\r\\nAs of June 2017, Subway has approximately 44,000 stores worldwide, all independently owned.[13] located in 112 countries. These locations are largely concentrated in North America, with about 26,400 in the United States (plus about 3,300 in Canada and 1,000 in Mexico),[27] which is almost as many U.S. locations as McDonalds and Starbucks combined.[13] Outside North America, the countries with the most locations are Australia (approximately 1,400), Brazil (approximately 2,200) and the United Kingdom (approximately 2,300).[27]\\r\\nSubway's core product is the submarine sandwich (or \\"sub\\"). In addition to these, the chain also sells wraps, salad, paninis, and baked goods (including cookies, doughnuts, and muffins).\\r\\nSubway's best-selling sandwich,[28] the B.M.T., contains pepperoni, salami, and ham. The name originally stood for Brooklyn Manhattan Transit, but now stands for \\"Bigger, Meatier, Tastier\\".[29]\\r\\nSubway also sells breakfast sandwiches, English muffins, and flatbread. In 2006, \\"personal pizzas\\" debuted in some US markets. These are made to order (like the subs) and heated for 85 seconds. Breakfast and pizza items are only available in some stores. In November 2009, Subway signed a deal to serve exclusively Seattle's Best Coffee coffee as part of its breakfast menu in the US.[30]\\r\\nA 2009 Zagat survey named Subway the best provider of \\"Healthy Options\\" (in the \\"Mega Chain\\" category). Subway was also first in \\"Top Service\\" and \\"Most Popular\\" rankings. It placed second in \\"Top Overall\\", behind Wendy's.[31]\\r\\nOn April 18, 2017, Subway announced the addition of paninis to its menu. Chipotle Steak & Cheese, Triple Cheese, Chicken Cordon Bleu, and Italian B.M.T. Melt were the four variations announced.[32]\\r\\nSubway's menu varies between countries, most significantly where there are religious requirements relating to the meats served.\\r\\nIn 2006, the first kosher Subway restaurant in the United States opened, in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio in the Mandel JCC of Cleveland. Former Subway spokesman Jared Fogle attended the opening. A press release stated, \\"With slight modifications, such as no pork-based products, and the use of soy-based cheese product, the menu is virtually identical to that of any other Subway restaurant.\\"[33] Other openings soon followed, briefly making Subway one of the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chains.[34] At their peak, twelve kosher Subway locations were open in the U.S, including Kansas City and 5 in New York. As of 2011, only five remain, in Cleveland, Miami, Los Angeles and two stores in Maryland.[35] Franchisees who failed noted a lack of support from the parent location in advertising, higher costs of kosher food and supervision, the inability to remain open on Saturdays, and that customers who do not keep kosher prefer the original menu and prices.[35]\\r\\nSubway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in New Delhi. Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef and pork products in deference to Hindu and Muslim beliefs respectively and sell an extended vegetarian range due to the large number of vegetarians in the country. There are 591 Subway restaurants in 68 cities of India as of January 2017.[36] On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Jalandhar, Punjab.[37] On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in Paldi, Ahmedabad.[38]\\r\\nIn 2011, Subway introduced gluten-free bread and brownies to some locations in Texas.[39] It also cut the salt content of its sandwiches by 15 percent.[40]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, Subway has reduced salt content across its entire range by 33% and has committed to further reductions, in line with government targets.[41] Subway's range of \\"Low Fat\\" subs is endorsed by the charity Heart Research UK.[42]\\r\\nSubway is the second-biggest fast food advertiser in the United States, behind only McDonald's. It spent US$516,000,000 on measurable advertising in 2011.[43]\\r\\nSubway used the advertising slogan \\"Eat Fresh\\", and focused on how its sandwiches were made from freshly baked bread and fresh ingredients, in front of customers to their exact specifications, by employees which Subway called \\"Subway Sandwich Artists\\".\\r\\nIn 2005, Subway scrapped its \\"Sub Club\\" stamp promotion, citing a growing number of counterfeit stamps due to online auction sites and the increasing availability of high-quality printers.[44][45]\\r\\nIn November 2007, Subway's US commercials featured the cartoon character Peter Griffin (from FOX's Family Guy) promoting its new Subway Feast sandwich.[46] Subway has also used \\"instant win\\" games, based on the game Scrabble.\\r\\nSubway ran a product placement campaign in the US TV series Chuck since its first season. As ratings dwindled in the second season, a campaign to \\"save Chuck\\" was launched for fans, encouraging them to purchase a footlong sub from Subway on April 27, 2009, the date of the season finale. Tony Pace, Subway's marketing officer, called it the best product placement the restaurant chain has done \\"in several years.\\"[47]\\r\\nTo celebrate National Sandwich Day on November 3, 2015, Subway offered a Buy One sandwich, Give One sandwich free promotion.[48]\\r\\nSubway has sponsored a number of sports events, particularly NASCAR races, including the Subway 400 (2002ÿ2004), Subway 500 (2003ÿ2007), Subway Fresh 500 (2005ÿ2013) and the Subway Firecracker 250 (2009ÿ2016). Subway sponsored the Subway Super Series ice hockey tournament from 2009ÿ2014.\\r\\nJared Fogle was a national spokesman for the company in the US starting in January 2000, giving talks on healthy living and appearing in advertisements. Fogle first came to attention in his native Indiana by claiming that he lost over 200 pounds in part by eating at Subway. From 2008, he was featured less often as the company marketed with more emphasis on its \\"5 dollar footlong\\" campaign.[49] Subway attributed between one-third and one-half of its growth from 1998 to 2011 to Fogle, the equivalent of a tripling in size.[50] Subway cut ties with Fogle on August 18, 2015, amid expectations that he would plead guilty to child pornography and child molestation charges,[51] which were confirmed the following day.[52] In November 2015, he was sentenced to more than 15 years in federal prison.[53]\\r\\nIn December 2015, following the removal of Fogle from its marketing, Subway introduced a new marketing campaign, \\"Founded on Fresh\\". The campaign focuses on Subway's establishment and early history, and features Fred DeLuca, as played by his son, Jonathon. The new campaign downplays the use of jingles and celebrity endorsements (besides \\"targeted\\" sports marketing), in favor of focusing upon the qualities of its products, and specific products. Chief advertising officer Chris Carroll explained that the focus on fat, calories, and weight loss were \\"what fresh used to be\\", and that the new campaign would focus more on the sourcing of Subway's ingredients, such as its phase-out of antibiotic-treated meat. Carroll also explained that the new strategy was being developed prior to the controversy involving Fogle.[54]\\r\\nIn 2008, Subway began to offer all foot-long submarine sandwiches (excluding premium and double-meat varieties) for five dollars, in the continental United States and Canada, as a \\"limited time only\\" promotion. \\"Five Dollar Footlongs\\" quickly became the company's most successful promotion ever.[55] Upon the initial promotion's completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a permanent \\"$5 Footlong Everyday Value Menu\\" that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. As of 2011, there has been a monthly rotating $5 footlong.[56]\\r\\nIn October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for S3 (for a six-inch sub) or S5 (for a footlong).[57]\\r\\nIn 2012, San Francisco discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion due to the higher cost of doing business in the city.[58] From June 2014 to the end of that year, some Subway locations began discontinuing the $5 dollar promotion.[59] On November 1, 2014, Subway discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion, replacing it with the Simple $6 Menu which included a six-inch select with a drink and a choice of cookies or chips.[60][61]\\r\\nOn February 4, 2016, all classic footlongs were declared to be set at a new cost of $6 each.[62]\\r\\nOn January 1, 2018, the $5 promotion returned with a $4.99 footlong menu of five subs, at participating locations.[63][64][65]\\r\\nIn early 2017, Subway introduced its Italian Hero, and advertised it with a campaign describing it as an authentic Italian[-American] sandwich. Two comedic spots feature stereotypical Italian-American characters on and around the stoop of a New York / New Jersey tenement building, one including a cameo by sportscaster Dick Vitale. Another ad features Food Network's Jeff Mauro, the \\"Sandwich King\\", who is Italian-American,[66] discussing the nature and role of the different Italian meats and other ingredients.[67][68][69][70][71][72]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2015, Subway released a commitment to transition to a 100% cage-free egg supply chain by 2025.[73]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2017, Subway released a chicken welfare policy[74] that states that by 2024 or sooner, 100% of its U.S. chicken products will be produced in alignment with Global Animal Partnership (GAP) standards for higher welfare breeds, enhanced living environments (including lighting, litter, and enrichment), increased activity levels and optimized stocking density, and improved slaughter methods. To ensure compliance, Subways chicken suppliers will be third-party audited with updates communicated annually.[75]\\r\\nThe policy announcement followed a nationwide campaign led by high school animal activist Lia Hyman in coordination with the animal protection NGO The Humane League.[76] On April 20, 2017, Hyman and a group of activists traveled to Subways global headquarters in Connecticut to deliver more than 53,000 signatures from campaign supporters and held a demonstration outside the building after they were denied entry.[77]\\r\\nIn September 1999, at least 32 customers in the north Seattle area contracted hepatitis A after eating food contaminated with the virus at two Subway outlets.[78] The virus, which is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with infected feces, infects the liver causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever.[79] Subsequent investigations found that staff failed to adhere to thorough hand washing and the use of plastic gloves during food preparation.[80] A class-action lawsuit on behalf of 31 victims was resolved for $1.6 million.[81][82] The most seriously affected victima 6-year-old boysuffered acute liver failure and required a liver transplant. He was awarded $10 million in an out-of-court settlement in 2001.[80] A previous outbreak of hepatitis A in 1996 had also involved a Subway outlet in the Seattle area, although no legal action had resulted.[78]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the Arkansas Department of Health issued a warning to the public that customers who had eaten at the Subway outlet in Morrilton, Arkansas, may have been exposed to infection after an employee tested positive for the virus.[83][84]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2007, KNXV-TV (with the help of the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures) reported that three of Subway's \\"Giant Sub\\" sandwiches, nominally each 3-foot (91?cm) long, were actually 2?feet 8?inches (81?cm), 2?feet 8.25?inches (81.92?cm), and 2?feet 8.5?inches (82.6?cm) long. The maximum variance in length allowed in Arizona is 3% (1.08 inches (2.7?cm), for a three-foot sub). The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were 2?feet 10.75?inches (88.27?cm) in length; shorter than the maximum allowable variance. In response to the report, Subway said it was reevaluating its advertising, training and packaging materials with regard to the specific or implied length of Giant Subs, and was advising its franchisees to only discuss with customers the approximate number of expected servings and not a specific length of measurement.[85]\\r\\nIn January 2013, an Australian teen, Matt Corby, complained on Facebook that Subway's \\"footlong\\" sandwich was only 11 inches (28?cm) long, rather than 1 foot (30?cm). Subway responded by saying, \\"With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length.\\"[86] Discovery during a subsequent class-action lawsuit revealed that most Subway sandwiches were the advertised length. A $530,000 settlement was thrown out of court in 2017 for being \\"utterly worthless\\" to consumers.[87][88]\\r\\nIn 1995, Subway Sandwich Shops, Fred DeLuca, Peter Buck, and Doctor's Associates Inc. were held liable for breach of contract. An Illinois jury awarded more than $10 million in damages to Nicholas and Victoria Jannotta after finding lease and contract violations. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresented the asset value of Subway Sandwich Shops (a leasing company used by Doctor's Associates for franchising purposes) while negotiating a 1985 lease agreement.[89]\\r\\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' small business committee studied the franchise industry from 1992 to 1998. Dean Sagar noted, \\"Subway is the biggest problem in franchising and emerges as one of the key examples of every abuse you can think of.\\"[90] In 1989, the U.S. Small Business Administration refused small business loans to Subway franchise owners until Subway removed a contract clause which gave it the power to seize and purchase any franchise without cause. The Dallas Morning News reported Subway had seized American soldier Leon Batie Jr.'s Subway stores in 2006 while he was serving in Afghanistan.[91][92] He had been deployed to support Operation Enduring Freedom in March 2005, three years after buying his first restaurant.[91][92] Batie alleged Subway had violated the U.S. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. He filed a federal lawsuit against Subway, which was dismissed. He then filed suit in state court, in Dallas County, Texas. Both parties settled on \\"mutually agreeable\\" and confidential terms in January 2010.[93]\\r\\nIn October 2010, Subway franchisees in the United Kingdom lost a high court appeal, against paying standard VAT on all toasted subs, as required by HM Revenue and Customs. Thus, in the United Kingdom, a toasted sub attracts VAT, whereas a cold sub, eaten off the premises, does not. Competitors such as Quiznos & McDonald's do not pay VAT on similar food.[94][95][96]\\r\\nIn March 2012, Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne announced plans to close the loophole that allows Subway competitors to offer hot food without paying VAT. This legislation was expected to come into force from October 2012 onward,[97] but the government withdrew plans to charge VAT on originally hot food being allowed to cool naturally on May 28, 2012.[98] In June 2012, Subway launched the \\"Toast the Tax\\" campaign to put pressure on the government to drop VAT on toasted sandwiches, as it has done for hot savouries.[99]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2011, Subway lawyer Valerie Pochron, wrote to Casey's General Stores, a chain of Iowa-based convenience stores, demanding the small chain to cease using the term \\"footlong\\" in advertisements for its 12-inch sandwiches. Subway threatened to sue. Consequently, in February 2011, Casey's General Stores Inc. filed a petition in a U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeking a legal declaration that the word \\"footlong\\" does not violate Subway's rights.[100] Casey's further sought a declaration that the word \\"footlong\\" is a generic description of a sandwich measuring one foot.[101][102] Before serving its complaint on Subway, Casey's voluntarily dismissed its action, ending the litigation.[103]\\r\\nSubway's trademark application for \\"footlong\\" has yet to be approved by the federal government. Subway has attempted to register it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office twice. It filed on November 8, 2007,[104] and June 4, 2009.[105] Yum Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and non-Canadian A&W locations), Long John Silver's and other competitors are opposing that application.[106]\\r\\nSubway made alterations to its bread after food blogger and activist Vani Hari gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a petition drive. Subway removed azodicarbonamide from its bread.[107] Before Vani Hari's petition, Subway had used azodicarbonamide as a bread conditioner, to whiten the dough and allow sandwich bread to bake more quickly. The ingredient is still used by other fast food restaurants.[108]\\r\\nIn August 2015, Vani Hari again petitioned Subway in conjunction with Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, the Center for Food Safety, U.S. Public Interest Research Group to commit to buying meat produced without the routine use of antibiotics and to provide a timeline for doing so.[109] In October 2015, Subway announced it would transition to chicken raised without antibiotics in 2016 and turkey within the following 2ÿ3 years, and would also transition beef and pork raised without antibiotics by 2025.[110][111]\\r\\nIn an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s consumer affairs television series Marketplace aired in February 2017, chicken from five fast food restaurants were lab-tested to determine constituents. While DNA testing found between 84.9% and 89.4% of the DNA from other restaurants' chicken products to be chicken DNA, with the remaining being unidentifiable plant DNA, on the two Subway chicken items tested, 53.6% and 42.8% of the DNA was found to be chicken, with the remainder being mostly soy. Although ingredients listings did show soy protein to be a constituent of both of the chicken products, Subway states that the proportion is less than or equal to 1%, and that the finding of about 50% soy DNA is not representative of the actual amount of soy in the product. Subway has called CBC's report \\"absolutely false and misleading\\" and demanded that it be retracted, a demand the CBC had not acceded to as of July?2017[update]. Meanwhile, however, Subway Canada stated that it was investigating with its supplier to ensure that the proportion of soy protein was as per expectations.[112][113][114][115][116]\\r\\nAccording to Subway's website, ingredients in U.S. stores may differ from ingredients in Canadian stores. Both countries include soy protein in chicken strips, but only the U.S. version states that it is present in quantities of 2% or less. The Canadian version includes soy as an ingredient in its chicken patty, but the United States version does not.[117]\\r\\nIn April 2017, Subway sued the CBC, as well as the reporter and two producers, for $210 million, alleging the CBC acted \\"recklessly and maliciously\\", and that \\"these false statements... were published and republished, maliciously and without just cause or excuse, to a global audience, which has resulted in pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs.\\" The CBC stood by its reports, stating that the DNA tests were done by independent and credible experts.[118] The CBC's Emma Bdard stated that Subway has not provided any alternative explanation for the DNA test results obtained by the CBC.[119]","input":"When was the first subway sandwich shop opened?"},{"output":"Saint Petersburg","context":"","input":"What was the capital of russia before moscow?"},{"output":"the Philadelphia Warriors","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in the San Francisco Bay Area in Oakland, California. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Warriors play their home games at the Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have reached ten NBA Finals, winning six NBA championships in 1947,[b] 1956, 1975, 2015, 2017, and 2018. Golden State's six NBA championships are tied for third-most in NBA history with the Chicago Bulls, and behind only the Boston Celtics (17) and Los Angeles Lakers (16).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to the Bay Area and was renamed the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team changed its geographic moniker to Golden State, California's state nickname.[7][c] The team is nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of \\"W's\\".[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have both been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards. 18 Hall of Famers have played for the Warriors, while four have coached the team. Golden State holds the NBA records for best regular season with 73ÿ9 and most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined) with 88 in 2015ÿ16, as well as best postseason with 16ÿ1 (.941 winning percentage) in 2016ÿ17.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America. They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League.[10] Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.[11] The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946ÿ47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship.[b] Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors won its next championship in Philadelphia in the 1955ÿ56 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as \\"Wilt the Stilt\\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \\"home\\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the 1963ÿ64 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964ÿ65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA Finals in the 1966ÿ67 season, losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967ÿ68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972.  During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970ÿ71 season would be the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971ÿ72 season, in order to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.[7][c] Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974ÿ75. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 59-23, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975ÿ76 season. They were upset, however, by the 42ÿ40 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \\"Sleepy\\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles  moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers which is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series.  In the game, Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd's performance in the second half still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Sleepy Floyd game\\" was a catalyst for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area which was furthered by new coach Don Nelson, who engineered another successful string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin (collectively known as \\"Run TMC\\" after the rap group Run-D.M.C.). But \\"Run TMC\\" stayed together for only two seasons (winning only one playoff series), when coach Nelson, in a move to get a promising young front-court player to complement his run-and-gun system, sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who along with Dan Finnane owned the team between 1986 and 1995. In 1993ÿ94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing alongside off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. The 1994ÿ95 season was the first under new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995ÿ96 season, and ended up with a 36ÿ46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996ÿ97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30ÿ52 finish.[15] Following the season, Mullin was traded to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Erick Dampier and Duane Ferrell.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997ÿ98 season. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \\"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Jean had become the new Warriors' general manager in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.[17] St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and Jermaine O'Neal) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State), a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006ÿ07 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002ÿ03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars.\\r\\nChris Mullin succeeded St. Jean with the title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2004. He hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedri?? from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of  point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself. The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005ÿ06 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114ÿ109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering the 2006ÿ07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard ?arnas Jasikevi?ius and forward Josh Powell.[18] This trade allowed the Warriors to \\"run and gun\\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106ÿ107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26ÿ35.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42ÿ40) at 16ÿ5 in their last 21 games.[19] \\"We Believe\\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nLed by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedri??, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 & 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118ÿ112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3ÿ2. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18ÿ0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No.?8 seed to beat a No.?1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No.?8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006ÿ07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing blowout. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2007ÿ08 season, the Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),[21] and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48ÿ34 record, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot.  The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2008 offseason, Baron Davis opted to return to his home town and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. With the 14th pick of that year's draft, the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedri?? to long-term contracts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors had a disappointing 2008ÿ09 season, finishing 29ÿ53. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99-89.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach,[22] was promoted in his place and drafted Stephen Curry as an outstanding 7th lottery pick, but dubiously traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009ÿ10.[23]  as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2, making it their fifth D-League call-up that season, tying an NBA record. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year, and finished the season 26ÿ56, fourth in the Pacific Division.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 24, the Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh, a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their \\"The City\\" logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969ÿ71 \\"The City\\" uniforms. The Warriors made an offseason trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80?million deal, on a framework contingent on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. Following Morrow's departure after he signed the New Jersey Nets' offer sheet, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright, formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year, $11?million deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 15, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450?million.[24]\\r\\nOn November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadiv, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka and Dennis Wong.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors continued their signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option, the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5?million in mid-September. Keith Smart was hired as head coach that same month after  Nelson had resigned before the start of training camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2011 second-round pick. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a steady season without making any real ground in the playoff race, the Warriors broke franchise records with 21 made 3's in a win against the Orlando Magic. In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 3's in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005ÿ06. He then broke another NBA record, as the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. He ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most 3s attempted with 516, both of which set new Warrior franchise records.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors failed to make the playoffs after a 36-win season in 2010ÿ11, and coach Smart was dismissed on April 27 due to the change in ownership.[28] 17-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced him as head coach on June 6.[29] On December 19, they traded Amundson to the Indiana Pacers for small forward Brandon Rush.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors did not improve in the 2011ÿ12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shorted season with a 23ÿ43 record, 13th in the conference. The team suffered several injuries to key players, and due to the lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp.  They then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeam leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw off-guard Klay Thompson, the 11th overall pick of the 2011 NBA draft, move into a starting role. On July 11, they acquired point guard Jarrett Jack from the New Orleans Hornets in a three-team trade also including the Philadelphia 76ers, who received Dorell Wright from Golden State. On August 1, they signed forward Carl Landry on the termination of his one-year contract with the Hornets. In the 2012 NBA draft, they selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green 35th overall, and 7-foot 1-inch center Ognjen Kuzmic 52nd overall. In early November, swingman Rush was lost for the year with a torn ACL after falling awkwardly on the court early in the second game of the season, and less than a month later the team announced that Bogut was out indefinitely with a foot injury that was more serious than originally reported. Bogut did not return to regular play until late in the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing out of this maelstrom of trades and injuries with a team starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the Warriors had one of their best starts in decades, earning their 20th win before hitting the 30-game mark for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6ÿ1 road trip in franchise history, including a 97ÿ95 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006ÿ07 \\"We Believe\\" Warriors. This time, the local battlecry was \\"We Belong\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team finished the season with a record of 47ÿ35, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets to set an NBA single-season record, giving him the nickname \\"baby-faced assassin\\", and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection, dating back to Latrell Sprewell in the 1997 season. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the \\"Splash Brothers\\"[31] by team employee Brian Witt [32] for their backcourt shooting prowess, combined for 483 three-pointers during the season, easily besting the prior record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995ÿ96.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft, the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round.[33] In early July 2013, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and free agent Andre Iguodala to a four-year, $48 million deal. To make room under their salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedri?? and Brandon Rush, along with multiple draft picks, including their 2014 and 2017 first-round picks, to the Utah Jazz.[34] The Warriors lost free-agent guard Jarrett Jack, who departed for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and free agent power forward Carl Landry, who went to the Sacramento Kings. To help fill the void left by Landry, the Warriors signed forward-center Marreese Speights to a three-year, $10 million contract.[35] The team also signed one-year deals with veteran center Jermaine O'Neal ($2 million) and point guard Toney Douglas ($1.6 million).[36] On August 21, the Warriors signed 7?ft 1 in Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic, who had been playing in Europe since his selection in the 2012 NBA draft, to a guaranteed two-year deal.[37][38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors began the 2013ÿ14 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12ÿ9, as compared to 17ÿ4 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Festus Ezeli (off-season surgery to repair the right knee, out for the season), Toney Douglas (left tibia stress reaction, out nearly a month from mid-November to December), and Jermaine O'Neal (right wrist injury and surgery, out from mid-November to early February). Stephen Curry and Harrison Barnes were also out for at least four games before the all-star break, each with minor injuries. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month, during which time the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court, and the team posted a losing 5ÿ7 record while revealing a lack of depth on their bench. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak, which included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and just one short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins, set in the 1971ÿ72 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics[40] and then, a day before the trade deadline, trading Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake.[41] Thanks in part to the improved effectiveness of their backup squad, boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the all-star break. Nonetheless, and despite several victories over top contenders, the team displayed a pattern of losing games to inferior teams even at their home arena. On April 11, in a 112ÿ95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib that would keep him out of the post-season, a big blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors ended the season 51ÿ31, winning more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finishing 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tying the 1991ÿ92 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, in the first round of the playoffs the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game, which the Warriors lost, bringing their 2013ÿ14 season to an end. It was season of many thrilling moments in which the Warriors' played in 17 regular-season games decided by 2 points or less, 6 games with winning shots in the final 3 seconds, and 7 comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other noteworthy occurrences for the season, Curry was named to the starting lineup for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game. For Curry, the only Warrior named to the team, this was his first all-star appearance in five seasons as an NBA player. Curry hit another notable milestone in posting 4 triple-doubles for the season, tying a franchise record unequaled since Wilt Chamberlain in 1963ÿ64. Curry also averaged career-bests in points and assists; averaging 24.0 points and 8.5 assists in the season. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. On February 7, in a 102ÿ87 win over the Chicago Bulls, the backcourt duo became the first teammates to each make a three-pointer in 30 consecutive games.[43] Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by Seattle Supersonic Ray Allen in 2004ÿ05 and 2005ÿ06. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as the team rolled towards the post-season, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a \\"difference in philosophies\\"[44] and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo! Sports called \\"an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere\\" on the Warriors' coaching staff.[45] Fewer than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players.[46] During the post season, rumors persisted in the press that Mark Jackson's job as head coach was in jeopardy, leading the players to make a unanimous declaration of support for Jackson's return only minutes after the Warriors' first-round, game seven playoff loss to the Clippers.[47] Nonetheless, three days later, on May 6, the team announced the firing of Mark Jackson as head coach.[48] In his three-season tenure as head coach, Jackson compiled a 121-109 (.526) record, overseeing a terrific turnaround. When Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had made the playoffs only one time over the prior 17 seasons, averaging 30.2 wins per season during that period.[49] Jackson, 49, became just the third head coach in franchise history to lead a team to at least 50 wins in a season, joining Don Nelson and Alvin Attles, who both hit the mark twice with the Warriors. With 121 wins overall, Jackson ranks fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Attles (557), Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).[50] On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors named Steve Kerr the team's head coach, in a reported $25 million deal over five years.[51] It was a first-time head-coaching position for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion point guard who holds the all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr formerly served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team (2007 to 2010), and had most recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors completed the regular season with a record of 67-15, the best in the league and the most wins in franchise history.[52] The Warriors also finished with a home record of 39ÿ2, the second best in NBA history. They were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014ÿ15 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior to do so since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960. In the first round of the playoffs, they swept the New Orleans Pelicans, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in the second round in six games and defeated Houston Rockets in five games of the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975, where they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win their fourth NBA title, and their first in 40 years. Andre Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther highlights of the season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA history. In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014ÿ15 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors began the season by winning their first 24 games, eclipsing the previous best start in NBA history, set by the 1993ÿ94 Houston Rockets and the 1948ÿ49 Washington Capitols at 15ÿ0.[54][55] The Warriors surpassed the 1969ÿ70 New York Knicks for the best road start in NBA history at 14ÿ0, which is also the joint-third longest road win streak.[56] Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015.[57] The Warriors broke a 131-year-old record of 20ÿ0 set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America. Golden State also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014ÿ15 season, eclipsing the 2012ÿ13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history.[55] The team set an NBA record 54-straight regular season home game winning streak, which spanned from January 31, 2015 to March 29, 2016. The previous record of 44 was held by the 1995ÿ96 Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game, the first time the Warriors have had three All-Stars since 1976. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three pointers. He made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 13, 2016, Golden State set the record for most wins in a single season, beating Memphis, and finishing 73ÿ9.[60] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[61] \\r\\nThe Golden State Warriors went to their second consecutive appearance in the finals with a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[62] The Warriors went to a 3ÿ1 advantage but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at 3 wins apiece.[63] In Game 7 the Golden State Warriors lost the championship series on their homecourt, and earned the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first team to give up a 3ÿ1 lead in the NBA finals.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he would leave the Oklahoma City Thunder in order to sign a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors.[65] On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team.[66] The Durant signing made the Warriors the prohibitive favorites to win the NBA championship, according to oddsmakers.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016ÿ17 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116ÿ106 win over the Pelicans.[68] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142ÿ106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[69] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[70] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[71] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94ÿ87 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016ÿ17 regular season record of 67ÿ15. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start 12ÿ0, defeating in order the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4ÿ1 in the Finals, and their 16ÿ1 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.[73] After the Warriors announced that they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President Donald Trump rescinded his invitation.[74] The team still planned to travel to Washington, D.C. to \\"celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion.\\" Planned activities included meeting with local youth and a visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017ÿ18 regular season record of 58ÿ24. After defeating both the Spurs and the Pelicans 4-1, the Warriors came up against the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Despite reaching a 3-2 disadvantage against the Rockets after Game 5, the Warriors were able to stave off elimination and came back to win the series 4-3. The 2018 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for four consecutive years. The Warriors won their second-straight NBA championship after going 4ÿ0 in the Finals, marking the first NBA Finals sweep since 2007.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena which is expected to be ready for the 2019ÿ20 NBA season,[77][78] with construction to begin in early 2016.[79] The sale was finalized in October 2015.[80] The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views.[81] The new location, which still faces some vocal opposition in San Francisco, apparently eliminates the need for any voter approval, which would have been required with the original site.[82] Some type of waterfront park is planned across from the projected arena, which will be located at an already-existing Muni T-Third stop. The Central Subway, planned to open in 2018, may provide a direct connection between the new site and the downtown Powell Street Muni/BART station. Although the Warriors considered a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors,[83] it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return to San Francisco.[84] On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Warriors' new arena would be called Chase Center as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warrior guard Jim Barnett has done color commentary for the Warriors for more than 15 years, currently on NBC Sports Bay Area, where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year.[86] They also host Roundtable Live, a half-hour pre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Golden State home games. Fitzgerald is in his 20th season as the Warriors' play-by-play man, while Barnett is in his 32nd season as color man. Greg Papa, Garry St. Jean, and Kelenna Azubuike are also members of the telecast team, specializing in in-game, halftime and post-game analysis, while Kerith Burke serves as the sideline reporter.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Roye has done the radio play-by-play for Warrior games since 1995. He is joined in the booth by former Warriors forward Tom Tolbert for home games only. On August 25, 2016, the Warriors announced they were leaving long time station KNBR and all of their games will be broadcast on KGMZ.[88] After each game, Roye, Fitzgerald and Barnett get together for post-game radio analysis and a next-game preview.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoster ?

The first two generations (Ford Sync and MyFord Touch) run on the Windows Embedded Automotive operating system designed by Microsoft,[3] while the third generation (Sync 3) currently runs on the QNX operating system from BlackBerry Limited.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFord first announced the release of SYNC in January 2007 at the Detroit International Auto Show.[5] SYNC was released into the retail market in 2007 when Ford installed the technology in twelve Ford group vehicles (2008 model) in North America.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFord president and CEO Alan Mulally and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced the SYNC partnership between Ford and Microsoft at the annual North American International Auto Show in January 2007.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ford SYNC technology was promoted as a new product that provided drivers with the ability to operate Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones and digital media players in their vehicles using voice commands, the vehicle's steering wheel, and radio controls.[7] Later, new technology was added to SYNC in which text messages received by the driver are \\"vocalized\\" by a digitized female voice device named \\"Samantha\\". SYNC's text message function also has the ability to interpret approximately one hundred shorthand messages, such as \\"LOL\\", and will read \\"swear words\\", but does not decipher acronyms that have been considered by the designers to be \\"obscene\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, as a standalone option, the suggested retail price for the SYNC was US$395.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain voice commands, such as \\"Turn-by-turn directions\\", \\"Vehicle Health Report\\", \\"Weather\\" and climate control commands are not available in some countries such as Canada due to compatibility issues.  For example, many commands are not available because there is no French equivalent for a command in English.\\r\\nFord Canada expects to address these issues in upcoming versions of the software after the issues are worked out in detail, but there does not appear to be a firm release date.\\r\\n\\r\\nSYNC has various mobile-integration capabilities, including \\"Push to Talk\\" on the steering wheel, wireless transfer of contacts between a mobile phone and the on-board phone book, as well as various advanced calling features, such as caller ID, call waiting, conference calling, a caller log, a list of contacts, a signal strength icon, and a phone battery charge icon. Personal ring tones can also be assigned to identify specific callers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSYNC can convert a user's SMS messages to audio and read them out loud to the user through the vehicle's speaker system. This feature is carrier dependent as well as dependent on the device of the user. The feature is supported by several phone operating systems, including the iPhone, most Android models, and Windows Mobile. This feature is also dependent on the phone support Bluetooth Message Access Profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nSYNC can connect to popular digital music players via Bluetooth or a USB connection. Users can browse through music collections by genre, album, artist, and song title using voice commands. With certain devices, SYNC is also capable of playing protected content (for example Zune Pass downloads), provided that usage rights on the device are current.\\r\\n\\r\\nSYNC is fluent in American English, French, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 911 Assist application places a direct call to a local 911 emergency operator in the event of a serious accident with an air bag deployment.  Before initiating the emergency 911 call, SYNC will provide a 10-second window to allow the driver or passenger to decide whether to cancel the call. If not manually cancelled within the 10-second window, SYNC will place the emergency call. A pre-recorded message will play when the call is answered, and occupants in the vehicle will then be able to communicate directly with the 911 operator.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppLink allows iPhone and Android-based cellular devices to run approved applications using the car's buttons or voice commands. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first set of announced applications for the U.S. included Pandora Radio, Stitcher Radio, iHeartRadio, OpenBeak, NPR News, Slacker Radio, TuneIn Radio and Ford SYNC Destinations.[10] Rhapsody announced AppLink capability of its Android-based mobile app in January 2013.[11] Spotify was made available to iPhone users in March 2013.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nApplications for the U.K. market include miRoamer, Spotify, Personal Radio by AUPEO!, Glympse, EventSeeker, CitySeeker, Goal Live, Meople.Connector, HearMeOut and Audioteka S.A.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraffic, Directions and Information is an application that provides the user with traffic alerts, turn-by-turn directions and information about topics such as weather, sports, news and 411 business search.

A user attaches RFID tags to an object, allowing the SYNC system to detect the object's presence or absence and noting the object's status on the in-dash computer display.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsers can create \\"job lists\\" of objects to verify that tools needed for a certain job are present in the truck before heading to a job site. At the end of the job, the system can inventory items in the truck to ensure that no tools are left on the job site.[17] Ford developed the Tool Link application with power tool manufacturer DeWalt along with ThingMagic.[15][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFord had exclusive use of the Microsoft Auto embedded operating system that powered the early versions of SYNC until the exclusivity agreement expired in November 2008.

Later that month, Ford Work Solutions, a collection of five applications marketed towards professionals who buy Ford trucks, was added. The applications included in the Ford Work Solution were Crew Chief, Garmin Nav, LogMeIn and Tool Link.[3][3] SYNC v4 and v5 were released in January 2010 and January 2011, respectively, and enabled the Ford developed MyFord Touch application for certain 2011 model year vehicles as well as SYNC AppLink capabilities for certain 2011 model year vehicles.[3] The latest version of SYNC was released in November 2012 by Ford and is only applicable to certain vehicles and configurations.\\r\\n\\r\\nFord has extended the warranty for Sync on several 2011 to 2014 models to five years as a customer satisfaction matter. (Field Service Action Number: 12M02)[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 11, 2014, Ford announced Sync 3, which will replace MyFord Touch, will have simpler features and will be powered by QNX software by BlackBerry Limited instead of Microsoft.[4] The Sync 3 name will be used for both Ford and Lincoln models, though Lincoln's will have a different theme. Over half of Ford's North American vehicles will have Sync 3 by the end of 2015 and will be expanded globally afterwards; vehicles not equipped with Sync 3 will be equipped with the original Ford Sync.[4] Ford cited issues with Microsoft's complex software dragging down its scores with Consumer Reports and other consumer magazines being a reason it switched to the BlackBerry QNX operating system.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n The SYNC computer, which Ford calls the Accessory Protocol Interface Module (APIM), is housed separately from the head unit,  called the Audio Control Module (ACM), and interfaces with all vehicle audio sources as well as the high-speed and medium-speed vehicle CAN-buses.[20][21] The first generation of the Ford's SYNC computer was designed in cooperation with Continental AG[22] and is built around a 400?MHz Freescale i.MX31L processor with an ARM 11 CPU core, uses 256?MB of 133?MHz Mobile DDR SDRAM from Micron and 2?GB of Samsung NAND flash memory,[23][24] runs the Windows Embedded Automotive operating system,[25] and uses speech technology by Nuance Communications. Utilizing the USB port, SYNC's Microsoft Windows Auto-based operating system can be updated to work with new personal electronic devices.  A Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR) BlueCore4 chip provides Bluetooth connectivity with compatible phones and devices. SYNC's major circuit board chips cost roughly US$27.80, which allows Ford to profitably sell the system at a much lower price than competitive offerings.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Shutko and Tijerina reviewed large naturalistic studies on cars (Dingus and Klauer, 2008; Klauer et al., 2006; Young and Schreiner, 2009), heavy good vehicles (Olsen at el, 2008) and commercial vehicles and buses (Hickman et al., 2010) in field operational tests (Sayer et al., 2005, 2007), and concluded that:","input":"What is the most recent version of ford sync?"},{"output":"Lager","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrewing in Ireland has a long history. Production currently stands at over 8 million hectolitres, and approximately half the alcohol consumed is beer.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLager accounts for 60% of the beer sold, stout 34% and ale 6%.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were over two hundred breweries in the country, fifty-five of them in Dublin. In the nineteenth century, the number of breweries fell to about fifty, and by 2007 only about twelve remained.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, Ireland produced ale, without the use of hops, as the plant is not native to Ireland. Large quantities of hops were imported from England in the 18th century. In 1752, more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone.[4] In the second half of the 18th century, beer, mostly porter, was imported from England in increasing quantities: 15,000 barrels in 1750, 65,000 in 1785, and over 100,000 in 1792.[5] In the 1760s about 600,000 barrels of beer were brewed annually in Ireland.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 18th century, the Irish Parliament used taxation to encourage brewing at the expense of distilling, reasoning that beer was less harmful than whiskey.[5] In the 1760s, the Royal Dublin Society offered prizes to brewers who used the most Irish hops and those that produced the most porter.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrewing prospered in the early decades of the 19th century and by 1814 Ireland was exporting more beer to England than it imported.[7] Irish exports to England accelerated as the century progressed[7] and from a modest 11,328 barrels in 1828, exported 689,796 barrels by 1901.\\r\\n\\r\\nin 1998, Ireland produced approximately 8.5m hectolitres of beer per year; this rose to 8.7m in 2002. Exports were 3.5m hectolitres in 1998 and fell to 2.4m in 2002.[8] Whilst Ireland lies 6th in the world for beer consumption per capita, it ranks 4th in the consumption of alcohol, with 11.7 litres per head in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first lager brewery in Ireland was set up in Dartry, Dublin, in 1891, but did not survive very long. Lager was later brewed for a short period at the Regal Brewery, Kells.[9] Harp Lager has been brewed in Dundalk since 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeineken Ireland, based at the Murphy Brewery in Cork, have the largest share of the lager market.[10] In addition to Heineken, they brew Amstel and Coors Light, as well as the brands they acquired from Beamish & Crawford including Fosters and Carling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ales produced in Ireland are now largely in the Irish red ale style, with a slight red colour, generally in the 3.8ÿ4.4% ABV range (although export versions are often stronger). The largest national brand is Smithwick's, produced by the Diageo multinational. Others include Diageo's Macardle's, Franciscan Well's Rebel Red, Carlow Brewing Company's O'Hara's Irish Red and Messrs Maguire Rusty. Ireland's second-largest brewer, Heineken, no longer makes a red ale in Ireland, having discontinued local production of Murphy's Red and Beamish Red. Dungarvan Brewing Company's Copper Coast red ale was released in 2010, along with Clanconnel Brewery's McGrath's Irish Red. Eight Degrees brewery launched their Sunburnt Irish Red Ale in 2011.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1756, Arthur Guinness set up a small brewery, moving to Dublin in 1759. Having initially brewed ale, he switched to producing porter, which was a style from London. In the early twentieth century, Guinness became the largest brewer in the world, exporting the Irish style to many countries.[12] Although no longer the largest brewer of beer\\r\\nin the world, it remains the largest brewer of stout. In 2014, Guinness sales amounted to 19% of all beer sales in Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nStout brewed by Guinness (and the smaller brewers Murphy's and Beamish) once dominated domestic beer consumption in Ireland, with lager and ale having much smaller shares. Lager has subsequently grown in popularity with Carlsberg taking 8% of the market and Budweiser 7% in 2014.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nDraught Irish stout is normally served nitrogenated, to create a creamy texture with a long-lasting head.\\r\\n\\r\\nCraft stouts available in Ireland include Shandon Stout by the Franciscan Well in Cork, O'Hara's Irish stout by Carlow Brewing Company, Black Rock Irish Stout by Dungarvan Brewing Company and Irish stout by Galway Hooker Brewery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the 1990s, brewpubs and microbreweries began to emerge. While some, such as the Biddy Early Brewery, Dublin Brewing Company and Dwan's, have since ceased production, the Franciscan Well Brewpub in Cork and Dublin's Porterhouse have both celebrated ten years in business, while the Hilden Brewery in Lisburn is Ireland's oldest independent brewer, having been established in 1981.[14] The Carlow Brewing Company, established in 1996 and makers of the O'Hara's range, is another survivor of the \\"first wave\\" of Irish craft brewing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"second wave\\" began in the mid-2000s and has included the Beoir Chorca Dhuibhne brewery in County Kerry, Galway Hooker brewery in County Galway, Dungarvan Brewing Company, Clanconnel Brewery, Trouble Brewing, Metalman Brewing,[15] The Dingle Brewing Company in County Kerry, Bo Bristle (formerly Breweyed), Eight Degrees Brewing, and the Galway Bay Brewery, which, like the Porterhouse Brewing Company, also runs its own chain of pubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"third wave\\" of Irish craft brewing began in 2013.[16] The surge of new breweries is largely a result of changes in excise requirements, access to EU funding,[17] and an increase in government-funded brewing education courses.[18] Many second- and third-wave brewers are also involved in a professional brewers' association, Beer Ireland, which has provided members with networking opportunities and information on setting up a brewery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, there were approximately fifty Irish craft brewing businesses either in production or in planning. Despite this growth, in 2014 craft beers represented only 1.5% of beer sales by volume in Ireland.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British-based pub chain J D Wetherspoon has about five (was nine) outlets in Northern Ireland selling real ale and opened pubs in Cork and Dublin in early 2014, with three more planned for 2016 (dated) .[19]\\r\\n[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three brewing associations operating in Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeoir (Irish for \\"beer\\"), founded in July 2010, is an independent group of consumers which seeks greater choice, quality, and value-for-money for beer and cider drinkers on the island of Ireland.

The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century and was formally established in 1863.[5] Among its founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church.[6]\\r\\nMuch of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to common Protestant Christian teachings, such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Distinctive teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church is known for its emphasis on diet and health, its \\"holistic\\" understanding of the person,[7] promotion of religious liberty, and its conservative principles and lifestyle.[8]\\r\\nThe world church is governed by a General Conference, with smaller regions administered by divisions, union conferences, and local conferences. It currently has a worldwide baptized membership of over 20 million people, and 25 million adherents.[9][10] As of May 2007, it was the twelfth-largest religious body in the world,[11] and the sixth-largest highly international religious body.[12] It is ethnically and culturally diverse, and maintains a missionary presence in over 215 countries and territories.[2][13] The church operates over 7,500 schools including over 100 post-secondary institutions, numerous hospitals, and publishing houses worldwide, as well as a humanitarian aid organization known as the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA).\\r\\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church is the largest of several Adventist groups which arose from the Millerite movement of the 1840s in upstate New York, a phase of the Second Great Awakening. William Miller predicted on the basis of Daniel 8:14ÿ16 and the \\"day-year principle\\" that Jesus Christ would return to Earth between the spring of 1843 and the spring of 1844. In the summer of 1844, Millerites came to believe that Jesus would return on October 22, 1844, understood to be the biblical Day of Atonement for that year. When this did not happen (an event known as the \\"Great Disappointment\\"), most of his followers disbanded and returned to their original churches.\\r\\nHiram Edson and other Millerites came to believe that Miller's calculations were correct, but that his interpretation of Daniel 8:14 was flawed as he assumed Christ would come to cleanse the world. These Adventists came to the conviction that Daniel 8:14 foretold Christ's entrance into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary rather than his Second Coming. Over the next few decades this understanding of a sanctuary in heaven developed into the doctrine of the investigative judgment, an eschatological process that commenced in 1844, in which every person would be judged to verify their eligibility for salvation and God's justice will be confirmed before the universe. This group of Adventists continued to believe that Christ's Second Coming would continue to be imminent, however they resisted setting further dates for the event, citing Revelation 10:6, \\"that there should be time no longer.\\"[14]\\r\\nAs the early Adventist movement consolidated its beliefs, the question of the biblical day of rest and worship was raised. The foremost proponent of Sabbath-keeping among early Adventists was Joseph Bates. Bates was introduced to the Sabbath doctrine through a tract written by Millerite preacher Thomas M. Preble, who in turn had been influenced by Rachel Oakes Preston, a young Seventh Day Baptist. This message was gradually accepted and formed the topic of the first edition of the church publication The Present Truth (now the Adventist Review), which appeared in July 1849.\\r\\nFor about 20 years, the Adventist movement consisted of a small, loosely knit group of people who came from many churches and whose primary means of connection and interaction was through James White's periodical The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald. They embraced the doctrines of the Sabbath, the heavenly sanctuary interpretation of Daniel 8:14, conditional immortality, and the expectation of Christ's premillennial return. Among its most prominent figures were Joseph Bates, James White, and Ellen G. White. Ellen White came to occupy a particularly central role; her many visions and spiritual leadership convinced her fellow Adventists that she possessed the gift of prophecy.\\r\\nThe church was formally established in Battle Creek, Michigan, on May 21, 1863, with a membership of 3,500.[5] The denominational headquarters were later moved from Battle Creek to Takoma Park, Maryland, where they remained until 1989. The General Conference headquarters then moved to its current location in Silver Spring, Maryland.\\r\\nThe denomination in the 1870s turned to missionary work and revivals, tripling its membership to 16,000 by 1880 and establishing a presence beyond North America during the late 19th century. Rapid growth continued, with 75,000 members in 1901. By this time the denomination operated two colleges, a medical school, a dozen academies, 27 hospitals, and 13 publishing houses. By 1945, the church reported 210,000 members in the US and Canada, and 360,000 elsewhere; the budget was $29 million and enrollment in church schools was 140,000.[15]\\r\\nThe church's beliefs and doctrines were first published in 1872 in Battle Creek Michigan as a brief statement called \\"A Synopsis of our Faith\\".[16] The church experienced challenges as it formed its core beliefs and doctrines especially as a number of the early Adventist leaders came from churches that held to some form of Arianism (Ellen G. White was not one of them).[17] This, along with some of the movement's other theological views, led to a consensus among conservative evangelical Protestants to regard it as a cult.[18][19][20][21] The teachings and writings of White, ultimately proved influential in shifting the church from largely semi-Arian[22] roots towards Trinitarianism.[23] Adventists, for the most part, credit her with bringing the Seventh-day Adventist church into a more comprehensive awareness of the GodHead during the 1890s. The Adventist Church adopted Trinitarian theology early in the 20th century and began to dialogue with other Protestant groups toward the middle of the century, eventually gaining wide recognition as a Protestant church. Christianity Today recognized the Seventh-day Adventist church as \\" the fifth-largest Christian communion worldwide\\" in its January 22, 2015 issue.[24]\\r\\nThe official teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination are expressed in its 28 Fundamental Beliefs. This statement of beliefs was originally adopted by the General Conference in 1980, with an additional belief (number 11) being added in 2005. Acceptance of either of the church's two baptismal vows is a prerequisite for membership. The following statement of beliefs is not meant to be read or received as a \\"creed\\" that is set in theological concrete. Adventists claim but one creed: \\"The Bible, and the Bible alone.\\"\\r\\nAdventist doctrine resembles trinitarian Protestant theology, with premillennial and Arminian emphases. Adventists uphold teachings such as the infallibility of Scripture, the substitutionary atonement, the resurrection of the dead and justification by faith alone, and are therefore often considered evangelical.[25] They believe in baptism by immersion and creation in six literal days. The modern Creationist movement started with Adventist George McCready Price, who was inspired by a vision of Ellen White.[26]\\r\\nThere is a generally recognized set of \\"distinctive\\" doctrines which distinguish Adventism from the rest of the Christian world, although not all of these teachings are wholly unique to Adventism:\\r\\nAs with any religious movement, a theological spectrum exists within Adventism comparable to the fundamentalist-moderate-liberal spectrum in the wider Christian church and in other religions. A variety of groups, movements or subcultures within the church present differing views on beliefs and lifestyle.\\r\\nThe conservative end of the theological spectrum is represented by historic Adventists, who are characterized by their opposition to theological trends within the denomination, beginning in the 1950s.[28] They object to theological compromises with evangelicalism, and seek to defend traditional Adventist teachings such as the human post-fall nature of Jesus Christ, investigative judgment, and character perfectionism.[29] Historic Adventism is represented by some scholars,[30] is also seen at the grassroots level of the church[31] and is often promoted through independent ministries.\\r\\nThe most liberal elements in the church are typically known as progressive Adventists (progressive Adventists generally do not identify with liberal Christianity). They tend to disagree with the traditional views concerning the inspiration of Ellen White, the Sabbath, a seven-day Creation, the doctrine of the remnant and the investigative judgment.[29][32] The progressive movement is supported by some scholars[33] and finds expression in bodies such as the Association of Adventist Forums and in journals such as Spectrum and Adventist Today.\\r\\nThe Biblical Research Institute is the official theological research center of the church. The church has two professional organizations for Adventist theologians who are affiliated with the denomination. The Adventist Society for Religious Studies (ASRS) was formed to foster a community among Adventist theologians who attend the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL) and the American Academy of Religion. In 2006 ASRS voted to continue their meetings in the future in conjunction with SBL. During the 1980s the Adventist Theological Society was formed to provide a forum for more conservative theologians to meet and is held in conjunction with the Evangelical Theological Society.\\r\\nPart of Friday might be spent in preparation for the Sabbath; for example, preparing meals and tidying homes. Adventists may gather for Friday evening worship to welcome in the Sabbath, a practice often known as Vespers.[34]\\r\\nAdventists abstain from secular work on Saturday. They will also usually refrain from purely secular forms of recreation, such as competitive sport and watching non-religious programs on television. However, nature walks, family-oriented activities, charitable work and other activities that are compassionate in nature are encouraged. Saturday afternoon activities vary widely depending on the cultural, ethnic and social background. In some churches, members and visitors will participate in a fellowship (or \\"potluck\\") lunch and AYS (Adventist Youth Service).\\r\\nThe major weekly worship service occurs on Saturday, typically commencing with Sabbath School which is a structured time of small-group study at church. Adventists make use of an officially produced \\"Sabbath School Lesson\\", which deals with a particular biblical text or doctrine every quarter.[35] Special meetings are provided for children and youth in different age groups during this time (analogous to Sunday school in other churches).\\r\\nAfter a brief break, the community joins together again for a church service that follows a typical evangelical format, with a sermon as a central feature. Corporate singing, Scripture readings, prayers and an offering, including tithing (or money collection), are other standard features. The instruments and forms of worship music vary greatly throughout the worldwide church.[36] Some churches in North America have a contemporary Christian music style, whereas other churches enjoy more traditional hymns including those found in the Adventist Hymnal. Worship is known to be generally restrained.\\r\\nAdventist churches usually practice communion four times a year. It commences with a foot washing ceremony, known as the \\"Ordinance of Humility\\", based on the Gospel account of John 13. The Ordinance of Humility is meant to symbolize Christ's washing of his disciples' feet at the Last Supper and to remind participants of the need to humbly serve one another. Participants segregate by gender to separate rooms to conduct this ritual, although some congregations allow married couples to perform the ordinance on each other and families are often encouraged to participate together. After its completion, participants return to the main sanctuary for consumption of the Lord's Supper, which consists of unleavened bread and unfermented grape juice.[37]\\r\\nSince the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church.[38] Adventists are known for presenting a \\"health message\\" that recommends vegetarianism and advocate adherence to the kosher laws in Leviticus 11, the observance of which means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as \\"unclean\\". The church discourages its members from consuming alcoholic beverages, tobacco or illegal drugs (compare Christianity and alcohol). In addition, some Adventists avoid coffee, tea, cola, and other beverages containing caffeine.\\r\\nThe pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals into the Western diet, and the \\"modern commercial concept of cereal food\\" originated among Adventists.[39] John Harvey Kellogg was one of the early founders of Adventist health work. His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of Kellogg's by his brother William. In both Australia and New Zealand, the church-owned Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently Weet-Bix.\\r\\nResearch funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health has shown that the average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of National Geographic, asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans.[40][41] The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.[42] Since Dan Buettner's 2005 National Geographic story about Adventist longevity, his book, The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest, named Loma Linda, California a \\"Blue Zone\\" because of the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists. He cites the Adventist emphasis on health, diet, and Sabbath-keeping as primary factors for Adventist longevity.[43][44]\\r\\nAn estimated 35% of Adventists practice vegetarianism or veganism, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders.[45][46]\\r\\nAdventists' clean lifestyles were recognized by the U.S. military in 1954 when 2,200 Adventists volunteered for Operation Whitecoat to be human test subjects for a range of diseases the effects of which were still unknown:\\r\\nThe first task for the scientists was to find people willing to be infected by pathogens that could make them very sick. They found them in the followers of the Seventh-day Adventist faith. Although willing to serve their country when drafted, the Adventists refused to bear arms. As a result many of them became medics. Now the U.S. was offering recruits an opportunity to help in a different manner: to volunteer for biological tests as a way of satisfying their military obligations. When contacted in late 1954, the Adventist hierarchy readily agreed to this plan. For Camp Detrick scientists, church members were a model test population, since most of them were in excellent health and they neither drank, smoked, nor used caffeine. From the perspective of the volunteers, the tests gave them a way to fulfill their patriotic duty while remaining true to their beliefs.[47]\\r\\nThe Adventist understanding of marriage is a lawfully binding lifelong commitment of a man and a woman. The Church Manual refers to the origination of the marriage institution in Eden and points to the union between Adam and Eve as the pattern for all future marriages.[48]\\r\\nAdventists hold that marriage is a divine institution established by God Himself before the fall. \\"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\\" (Gen. 2:24). They hold that God celebrated the first marriage and the institution has as its origin the Creator of the universe and was one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is \\"one of the two institutions that, after the fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise.\\"[49]\\r\\nThe Old and New Testament texts are interpreted by some Adventists to teach that wives should submit to their husbands in marriage.[50]\\r\\nAdventists hold that heterosexual marriages are the only biblically ordained grounds for sexual intimacy. Adventists do not perform same-sex marriages, and individuals who are openly homosexual (but not \\"practicing\\") cannot be ordained, but may hold church office and membership. Current church policy states that openly homosexual (and \\"practicing\\") persons are to be welcomed into the church services and treated with the love and kindness afforded any human being.[51][52]\\r\\nThe official Adventist position on abortion is that \\"abortions for reasons of birth control, gender selection, or convenience are not condoned.\\" At times, however, women may face exceptional circumstances that present serious moral or medical dilemmas, such as significant threats to the pregnant woman's life or health, severe congenital defects in the fetus, and pregnancy resulting from rape or incest; in these cases individuals are counselled to make their own decisions.[53]\\r\\nAdventists believe in and encourage abstinence for both men and women before marriage. The church disagrees with extra-marital cohabitation.[54] Adventists believe that scripture makes no accommodation for homosexual activity or relationships and the official position is opposed to it.[55]\\r\\nThe Adventist church has released official statements in relation to other ethical issues such as euthanasia (against active euthanasia but permissive of passive withdrawal of medical support to allow death to occur),[56] birth control (in favor of it for married couples if used correctly, but against abortion as birth control and premarital sex in any case)[57] and human cloning (against it while the technology is unsafe and would result in defective births or abortions).[58]\\r\\nAdventists have traditionally held socially conservative attitudes regarding dress and entertainment. These attitudes are reflected in one of the church's fundamental beliefs:\\r\\nFor the Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve ourselves only in those things which will produce Christlike purity, health, and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and beauty. While recognizing cultural differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting those whose true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but in the imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit.[27]\\r\\nAccordingly, many Adventists are opposed to practices such as body piercing and tattoos and refrain from the wearing of jewelry, including such items as earrings and bracelets. Some also oppose the displaying of wedding bands, although banning wedding bands is not the position of the General Conference.[59] Conservative Adventists avoid certain recreational activities which are considered to be a negative spiritual influence, including dancing, rock music and secular theatre.[60][61] However, major studies conducted from 1989 onwards found that a majority of North American church youth reject some of these standards.[62]\\r\\nThough it seems unbelievable to some, I'm thankful that when I grew up in the church [in the 1950s and 1960s] I was taught not to go to the movie theater, dance, listen to popular music, read novels, wear jewelry, play cards, bowl, play pool, or even be fascinated by professional sports.\\r\\nAdventists often cite the writings of Ellen White, especially her books, Counsels on Diet and Foods, Counsels to Parents, Teachers and Students, and Education as inspired sources for Christian deportment. The Adventist church officially opposes the practice of gambling.[64]\\r\\nThe Youth Department of the Adventist church runs age specific clubs for children and youth worldwide.\\r\\n\\"Adventurer\\" (grades 1-4), \\"Eager Beaver\\" (Kindergarten), and \\"Little Lambs\\" (pre-K) clubs are programs for younger children that feed into the Pathfinder program.\\r\\nPathfinders is a club for 5th to 10th grade (up to 12th in Florida Conference) boys and girls. It is similar to and based partly on the Scouting movement. Pathfinders exposes young people to such activities as camping, community service, personal mentorship, and skills-based education, and trains them for leadership in the church. Yearly \\"Camporees\\" are held in individual Conferences, where Pathfinders from the region gather and participate in events similar to Boy Scouts' Jamborees.\\r\\nAfter a person enters 9th grade, he or she is eligible to join Teen Leadership Training within Pathfinders. In the 11th grade, typically after being a member of a club, they can become a Pathfinder or Adventurer staff member and begin the \\"Master Guide\\" program (similar to Scout Master) which develops leaders for both Adventurers and Pathfinders.[65]\\r\\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church operates youth camps all over North America and many other parts of the world. Each camp varies in the activities they offer but most have archery, swimming, horses, arts and crafts, nature, high ropes challenge course, and many other common camp activities. In addition to regular camps some have specialty camps, or RAD camps, which vary in their activities such as a week of nature nuggets, surfing, waterskiing/wakeboarding, rock climbing, golf, skateboarding, whitewater rafting, mountain biking, cycling, basketball, and many others.\\r\\nThe Seventh-day Adventist church is governed by a form of representation which resembles the presbyterian system of church organization. Four levels of organization exist within the world church.[66][67]\\r\\nEach organization is governed by a general \\"session\\" which occurs at certain intervals. This is usually when administrative decisions are made. The president of the General Conference, for instance, is elected at the General Conference Session every five years. Delegates to a session are appointed by organizations at a lower level. For example, each local church appoints delegates to a conference session.\\r\\nTithes collected from church members are not used directly by the local churches, but are passed upwards to the local conferences/missions which then distribute the finances toward various ministry needs. Within a geographic region, ministers receive roughly equal pay irrespective of the size of their church.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Church Manual[66] gives provisions for each level of government to create educational, healthcare, publishing, and other institutions that are seen within the call of the Great Commission.\\r\\nThe ordained clergy of the Adventist church are known as ministers or pastors. Ministers are neither elected nor employed by the local churches, but instead are appointed by the local Conferences, which assign them responsibility over a single church or group of churches. Ordination is a formal recognition bestowed upon pastors and elders after usually a number of years of service. In most parts of the world, women may not be given the title \\"ordained\\", although some are employed in ministry, and may be \\"commissioned\\" or \\"ordained-commissioned\\".[68] However, beginning in 2012, some unions adopted policies of allowing member conferences to ordain without regard to gender.\\r\\nA number of lay offices exist within the local church, including the ordained positions of elder and deacon.[66] Elders and deacons are appointed by the vote of a local church business meeting or elected committees. Elders serve a mainly administrative and pastoral role, but must also be capable of providing religious leadership (particularly in the absence of an ordained minister). The role of deacons is to assist in the smooth functioning of a local church and to maintain church property.\\r\\nAlthough the church has no written policy forbidding the ordination of women, it has traditionally ordained only men. In recent years the ordination of women has been the subject of heated debate, especially in North America and Europe. In the Adventist church, candidates for ordination are chosen by local conferences (which usually administer about 50ÿ150 local congregations) and approved by unions (which serve about 6ÿ12 conferences). The General Conference, the church's world headquarters, claims the right to declare the worldwide qualifications for ordination, including gender requirements. The General Conference has never stated that ordination of women contravenes the Bible, but the General Conference has requested that no local conference ordain women until all parts of the world church accept the practice.[69]\\r\\nThe primary prerequisite for membership in the Adventist church is baptism by immersion. This, according to the church manual, should occur only after the candidate has undergone proper instruction on what the church believes.[66]\\r\\nAs of December 31, 2016, the church has 20,008,779 baptized members.[2] Between 2005 and 2015, around half a million people per year have joined the Adventist church, through baptisms and professions of faith.[2][70] The church is one of the world's fastest-growing organizations, primarily from membership increases in developing nations. Today, less than 7% of the world membership reside in the United States, with large numbers in Africa as well as Central and South America. Depending on how the data was measured, it is reported that church membership reached 1 million between 1955 and 1961, and grew to five million in 1986. At the turn of the 21st century the church had over 10 million members, which grew to over 14 million in 2005, 16 million in 2009, and 19 million in 2015.[71] It is reported that today over 25 million people worship weekly in Seventh-day Adventist churches worldwide.[72] The church operates in 202 out of 230 countries and areas recognized by the United Nations,[2] making it \\"probably the most widespread Protestant denomination\\".[73]\\r\\nG. Jeffrey MacDonald, an award-winning religion reporter, and author of Thieves in the Temple, reports that the SDA church is the fastest-growing church in the United States. \\"Newly released data show Seventh-day Adventism growing by 2.5% in North America, a rapid clip for this part of the world, where Southern Baptists and mainline denominations, as well as other church groups, are declining.\\"[74]\\r\\nThe church has been described as \\"something of an extended family\\",[75] enjoying close, \\"two-degrees-of-separation social networks\\".[76]\\r\\nThe Biblical Research Institute is the theological research center of the church.\\r\\nThe Ellen G. White Estate was established in 1915 at the death of Ellen White, as specified in her legal will. Its purpose is to act as custodian of her writings, and as of 2006 it has 15 board members. The Ellen G. White Estate also hosts the official Ellen White website whiteestate.org.\\r\\nThe Geoscience Research Institute, based at Loma Linda University, was founded in 1958 to investigate the scientific evidence concerning origins.\\r\\nStarted in the late 19th century, Adventist mission work today reaches people in over 200 countries and territories.[2] Adventist mission workers seek to preach the gospel, promote health through hospitals and clinics, run development projects to improve living standards, and provide relief in times of calamity.[77]\\r\\nMissionary outreach of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is aimed not only at non-Christians but also at Christians from other denominations. Adventists believe that Christ has called his followers in the Great Commission to reach the whole world. Adventists are cautious, however, to ensure that evangelism does not impede or intrude on the basic rights of the individual. Religious liberty is a stance that the Adventist Church supports and promotes.[78]\\r\\nGlobally, the Adventist Church operates 7,598 schools, colleges and universities, with a total enrollment of more than 1,545,000 and a total teaching staff of approximately 80,000.[79] It claims to operate \\"one of the largest church-supported educational systems in the world\\".[80] In the United States it operates the largest Protestant educational system, second overall only to that of the Roman Catholic Church.[81] The Adventist educational program strives to be comprehensive, encompassing \\"mental, physical, social and above all, spiritual health\\" with \\"intellectual growth and service to humanity\\" as its goal.\\r\\nThe largest (in terms of population) Seventh-day Adventist university in the world is Northern Caribbean University, located in Mandeville, Jamaica.\\r\\nAdventists run a large number of hospitals and health-related institutions. Their largest medical school and hospital in North America is Loma Linda University and its attached Medical Center. Throughout the world, the church runs a wide network of hospitals, clinics, lifestyle centers, and sanitariums. These play a role in the church's health message and worldwide missions outreach.[82]\\r\\nAdventist Health System is the largest not-for-profit multi-institutional Protestant healthcare system in the United States. It is sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and cares for over 4 million patients yearly.\\r\\nFor over 50 years the church has been active in humanitarian aid through the work of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA). ADRA works as a non-sectarian relief agency in 125 countries and areas of the world. ADRA has been granted General Consultative Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Worldwide, ADRA employs over 4,000 people to help provide relief in crises as well as development in situations of poverty.\\r\\nThe church embraces an official commitment to the protection and care of the environment[83] as well as taking action to avoid the dangers of climate change:[84] \\"Seventh-day Adventism advocates a simple, wholesome lifestyle, where people do not step on the treadmill of unbridled over-consumption, accumulation of goods, and production of waste. A reformation of lifestyle is called for, based on respect for nature, restraint in the use of the world's resources, reevaluation of one's needs, and reaffirmation of the dignity of created life.\\"[85]\\r\\nThe Adventist church has been active for over 120 years in promoting freedom of religion for all people regardless of faith. In 1893 its leaders founded the International Religious Liberty Association, which is universal and non-sectarian. The Seventh-day Adventist Church State Council serves, primarily through advocacy, to seek protection for religious groups from legislation that may affect their religious practices. In May 2011, for example, the organization fought to pass legislation that would protect Adventist employees who wish to keep the Sabbath. According to Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has, throughout its history, aggressively advocated for the separation of church and state.[86]\\r\\nAdventists have long been proponents of media-based ministries. Traditional Adventist evangelistic efforts consisted of street missions and the distribution of tracts such as The Present Truth, which was published by James White as early as 1849. Until J. N. Andrews was sent to Switzerland in 1874, Adventist global efforts consisted entirely of the posting of tracts such as White's to various locations.\\r\\nIn the last century, these efforts have also made use of emerging media such as radio and television. The first of these was H. M. S. Richards' radio show Voice of Prophecy, which was initially broadcast in Los Angeles in 1929. Since then Adventists have been on the forefront of media evangelism; It Is Written, founded by George Vandeman, was the first religious program to air on color television and the first major Christian ministry to utilize satellite uplink technology. Today the Hope Channel, the official television network of the church, operates 8 international channels broadcasting 24 hours a day on cable, satellite, and the Web.[87]\\r\\nAdventist World Radio was founded in 1971[88] and is the \\"radio mission arm\\" of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It utilizes AM, FM, shortwave, satellite, podcasting, and the Internet, broadcasting in 77 major language groups of the world with a potential coverage of 80% of the world's population. AWR's headquarters is in Silver Spring, Maryland, with studios throughout the world. A large portion of the ministry's income is derived from membership gifts.[89]\\r\\nSDA evangelists such as Doug Batchelor, Mark Finley and Dwight Nelson have undertaken a number of international satellite-broadcast live evangelistic events, addressing audiences in up to 40 languages simultaneously.[90]\\r\\nAdditionally, there exists a range of privately owned media entities representing Adventist beliefs. These include the 3ABN and SafeTV networks and organizations such as The Quiet Hour and Amazing Discoveries.\\r\\nIn 2016, the Church released their film, Tell the World that churches and institutions to show the film to the public, and for home viewing available on DVD as well as on social media like YouTube.[91][92]\\r\\nThe Adventist Church owns and operates many publishing companies around the world. Two of the largest are the Pacific Press and Review and Herald publishing associations, both located in the United States. The Review and Herald is headquartered in Hagerstown, Maryland.[93]\\r\\nThe official church magazine is the Adventist Review, which has a North American focus. It has a sister magazine (Adventist World), which has an international perspective. Another major magazine published by the church is the bimonthly Liberty magazine, which addresses issues pertaining to religious freedom.\\r\\nThe Adventist Church generally opposes the ecumenical movement, although it supports some of the other goals of ecumenism. The General Conference has released an official statement concerning the Adventist position with respect to the ecumenical movement, which contains the following paragraph:\\r\\nWhile not being a member of the World Council of Churches, the Adventist Church has participated in its assemblies in an observer capacity.[95] It is also formally recognized by the Covenant Christian Coalition.[96]\\r\\nThe Adventist Church has received criticism along several lines, including what some claim are heterodox doctrines, and in relation to Ellen G. White and her status within the church, and in relation to alleged exclusivist issues.[97]\\r\\nCritics such as evangelical Anthony Hoekema (who felt that Adventists were more in agreement with Arminianism) argue that some Adventist doctrines are heterodox. Several teachings which have come under scrutiny are the annihilationist view of hell, the investigative judgment (and a related view of the atonement), and the Sabbath; in addition, Hoekema also claims that Adventist doctrine suffers from legalism.[98]\\r\\nWhile critics such as Hoekema have classified Adventism as a sectarian group on the basis of its atypical doctrines,[18][19] it has been accepted as more mainstream by Protestant evangelicals since its meetings and discussions with evangelicals in the 1950s.[99] Notably, Billy Graham invited Adventists to be part of his crusades after Eternity, a conservative Christian magazine edited by Donald Barnhouse, asserted in 1956 that Adventists are Christians, and also later stated, \\"They are sound on the great New Testament doctrines including grace and redemption through the vicarious offering of Jesus Christ 'once for all'\\".[100] Walter Martin, who is considered by many to be the father of the counter-cult apologetics movement within evangelicalism, authored The Truth About Seventh-day Adventists (1960) which marked a turning point in the way Adventism was viewed.[101][102]\\r\\n...?it is perfectly possible to be a Seventh-day Adventist and be a true follower of Jesus Christ despite heterodox concepts?...\\r\\nLater on Martin planned to write a new book on Seventh-day Adventism, with the assistance of Kenneth R. Samples.[104] Samples subsequently authored \\"From Controversy to Crisis: An Updated Assessment of Seventh-day Adventism\\", which upholds Martin's view \\"for that segment of Adventism which holds to the position stated in QOD, and further expressed in the Evangelical Adventist movement of the last few decades.\\" However, Samples also claimed that \\"Traditional Adventism\\" appeared \\"to be moving further away from a number of positions taken in QOD\\", and at least at Glacier View seemed to have \\"gained the support of many administrators and leaders\\".[105]\\r\\nEllen G. White's status as a modern-day prophet has also been criticized. In the Questions on Doctrine era, evangelicals expressed concern about Adventism's understanding of the relationship of White's writings to the inspired canon of Scripture.[18] However, the church makes clear in belief No. 18 of the 28 fundamental beliefs, that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested.[106]\\r\\nA common criticism of Ellen White, widely popularized by Walter T. Rea, Ronald Numbers and others, is the claim of plagiarism from other authors.[107][108][109] An independent lawyer specializing in plagiarism, Vincent L. Ramik, was engaged to undertake a study of Ellen G. White's writings during the early 1980s, and concluded that they were \\"conclusively unplagiaristic\\".[110] When the plagiarism charge ignited a significant debate during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Adventist General Conference commissioned a major study by Dr. Fred Veltman. The ensuing project became known as the \\"'Life of Christ' Research Project\\". The results are available at the General Conference Archives.[111] Dr. Roger W. Coon,[112] David J. Conklin,[113] Dr. Denis Fortin,[114][115] King and Morgan,[116] and Morgan,[117] among others, undertook the refutation of the accusations of plagiarism. At the conclusion of his report, Ramik states:\\r\\nIt is impossible to imagine that the intention of Ellen G. White, as reflected in her writings and the unquestionably prodigious efforts involved therein, was anything other than a sincerely motivated and unselfish effort to place the understandings of Biblical truths in a coherent form for all to see and comprehend. Most certainly, the nature and content of her writings had but one hope and intent, namely, the furthering of mankind's understanding of the word of God. Considering all factors necessary in reaching a just conclusion on this issue, it is submitted that the writings of Ellen G. White were conclusively unplagiaristic.[118]\\r\\nFinally, critics have alleged that certain Adventist beliefs and practices are exclusivist in nature and point to the Adventist claim to be the \\"remnant church\\", and the traditional Protestant association of Roman Catholicism as \\"Babylon\\".[119][120][121] These attitudes are said to legitimize the proselytising of Christians from other denominations. In response to such criticisms, Adventist theologians have stated that the doctrine of the remnant does not preclude the existence of genuine Christians in other denominations, but is concerned with institutions.[122]\\r\\nWe fully recognize the heartening fact that a host of true followers of Christ are scattered all through the various churches of Christendom, including the Roman Catholic communion. These God clearly recognizes as His own. Such do not form a part of the \\"Babylon\\" portrayed in the Apocalypse.\\r\\nEllen White also presented it in a similar light:\\r\\nGod has children, many of them, in the Protestant churches, and a large number in the Catholic churches, who are more true to obey the light and to do [to] the very best of their knowledge than a large number among Sabbathkeeping Adventists who do not walk in the light.\\r\\nIn addition to the ministries and institutions which are formally administered by the denomination, numerous para-church organizations and independent ministries exist. These include various health centers and hospitals, publishing and media ministries, and aid organizations.\\r\\nA number of independent ministries have been established by groups within the Adventist church who hold a theologically distinct position or wish to promote a specific message, such as Hope International which have strained relationship with the official church, which has expressed concerns that such ministries may threaten Adventist unity.[123] Some independent ministries, like many of the Protestant reformers have continued emphasizing the mainstream Adventist belief that identified the Roman Papacy as the Antichrist.[124] The church has put out a statement clarifying the official position that it does not condone any behavior by members which may \\"have manifested prejudice and even bigotry\\" against Catholics.[125]\\r\\nThroughout the history of the denomination, there have been a number of groups who have left the church and formed their own movements.\\r\\nFollowing World War I, a group known as the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement was formed as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in war. Those who were opposed to this stand and who refused to join the war were declared \\"disfellowshipped\\" by the local Church leaders at the time. When the Church leaders from the General Conference came and admonished the local European leaders after the war to try to heal the damage, and bring the members together, it met with resistance from those who had suffered under those leaders. Their attempts at reconciliation failed after the war, the group became organized as a separate church at a conference held July 14ÿ20, 1925. The movement officially incorporated in 1949.[126]\\r\\nIn 2005, the mainstream church again looking to resolve what the German leaders had done, apologized for its failures during World War II expressing that they \\"'deeply regret' any participation in or support of Nazi activities during the war by the German and Austrian leadership of the church.\\"[127]\\r\\nIn the Soviet Union the same issues produced the group known as True and Free Seventh-day Adventists. This formed as the result of a schism within the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Europe during World War I over the position its European church leaders took in having members join the military or on the keeping of the Sabbath. The group remains active today (2010) in the former republics of the Soviet Union.[128]\\r\\nWell known but distant offshoots are the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization and the Branch Davidians, themselves a schism within the larger Davidian movement.[129] The Davidians formed in 1929, following Victor Houteff after he came out with his book The Shepherd's Rod which was rejected as heretical. A succession dispute after Houteff's death in 1955 led to the formation of generally two groups, the original Davidians and the Branches. Later, another ex-Adventist, David Koresh, led the Branch Davidians until he died in the 1993 siege at the group's headquarters near Waco, Texas.\\r\\nA number of Adventists who apostatized, such as former ministers Walter Rea and Dale Ratzlaff, and have become critics of the church's teachings and particularly of Ellen G.

Natural rights are those that are not dependent on the laws or customs of any particular culture or government, and so are universal and inalienable (they cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws). Legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by a given legal system (they can be modified, repealed, and restrained by human laws).\\r\\nThe concept of natural law is related to the concept of natural rights. Natural law first appeared in ancient Greek philosophy,[1] and was referred to by Roman philosopher Cicero. It was subsequently alluded to in the Bible,[2] and then developed in the Middle Ages by Catholic philosophers such as Albert the Great and his pupil Thomas Aquinas. During the Age of Enlightenment, the concept of natural laws was used to challenge the divine right of kings, and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a social contract, positive law, and government ÿ and thus legal rights ÿ in the form of classical republicanism. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.\\r\\nThe idea of human rights is also closely related to that of natural rights: some acknowledge no difference between the two, regarding them as synonymous, while others choose to keep the terms separate to eliminate association with some features traditionally associated with natural rights.[3] Natural rights, in particular, are considered beyond the authority of any government or international body to dismiss. The 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an important legal instrument enshrining one conception of natural rights into international soft law. Natural rights were traditionally viewed as exclusively negative rights,[4] whereas human rights also comprise positive rights.[5] Even on a natural rights conception of human rights, the two terms may not be synonymous.\\r\\nThe proposition that animals have natural rights is one that gained the interest of philosophers and legal scholars in the 20th century and into the 21st.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that certain rights are natural or inalienable also has a history dating back at least to the Stoics of late Antiquity and Catholic law of the early Middle Ages, and descending through the Protestant Reformation and the Age of Enlightenment to today.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe existence of natural rights has been asserted by different individuals on different premises, such as a priori philosophical reasoning or religious principles. For example, Immanuel Kant claimed to derive natural rights through reason alone. The United States Declaration of Independence, meanwhile, is based upon the \\"self-evident\\" truth that \\"all men are  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\\".[7]\\r\\nLikewise, different philosophers and statesmen have designed different lists of what they believe to be natural rights; almost all include the right to life and liberty as the two highest priorities. H. L. A. Hart argued that if there are any rights at all, there must be the right to liberty, for all the others would depend upon this. T. H. Green argued that if there are such things as rights at all, then, there must be a right to life and liberty, or, to put it more properly to free life.[8] John Locke emphasized \\"life, liberty and property\\" as primary. However, despite Locke's influential defense of the right of revolution, Thomas Jefferson substituted \\"pursuit of happiness\\" in place of \\"property\\" in the United States Declaration of Independence.\\r\\nStephen Kinzer, a veteran journalist for The New York Times and the author of the book All The Shah's Men, writes in the latter that:\\r\\nThe Zoroastrian religion taught Iranians that citizens have an inalienable right to enlightened leadership and that the duty of subjects is not simply to obey wise kings but also to rise up against those who are wicked. Leaders are seen as representative of God on earth, but they deserve allegiance only as long as they have farr, a kind of divine blessing that they must earn by moral behavior.\\r\\nThe Stoics held that no one was a slave by nature; slavery was an external condition juxtaposed to the internal freedom of the soul (sui juris). Seneca the Younger wrote:\\r\\nIt is a mistake to imagine that slavery pervades a man's whole being; the better part of him is exempt from it: the body indeed is subjected and in the power of a master, but the mind is independent, and indeed is so free and wild, that it cannot be restrained even by this prison of the body, wherein it is confined.[9]\\r\\nOf fundamental importance to the development of the idea of natural rights was the emergence of the idea of natural human equality. As the historian A.J. Carlyle notes: \\"There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by Cicero and Seneca.... We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature.\\"[10] Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that \\"the idea of the equality of men is the profoundest contribution of the Stoics to political thought\\" and that \\"its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it.\\"[11] Cicero argues in De Legibus that \\"we are born for Justice, and that right is based, not upon opinions, but upon Nature.\\"[12]\\r\\nOne of the first Western thinkers to develop the contemporary idea of natural rights was French theologian Jean Gerson, whose 1402 treatise De Vita Spirituali Animae is considered one of the first attempts to develop what would come to be called modern natural rights theory.[13]\\r\\nCenturies later, the Stoic doctrine that the \\"inner part cannot be delivered into bondage\\"[14] re-emerged in the Reformation doctrine of liberty of conscience. Martin Luther wrote:\\r\\nFurthermore, every man is responsible for his own faith, and he must see it for himself that he believes rightly. As little as another can go to hell or heaven for me, so little can he believe or disbelieve for me; and as little as he can open or shut heaven or hell for me, so little can he drive me to faith or unbelief. Since, then, belief or unbelief is a matter of every one's conscience, and since this is no lessening of the secular power, the latter should be content and attend to its own affairs and permit men to believe one thing or another, as they are able and willing, and constrain no one by force.[15]\\r\\n17th-century English philosopher John Locke discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being \\"life, liberty, and estate (property)\\", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract. Preservation of the natural rights to life, liberty, and property was claimed as justification for the rebellion of the American colonies. As George Mason stated in his draft for the Virginia Declaration of Rights, \\"all men are born equally free,\\" and hold \\"certain inherent natural rights, of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity.\\"[16] Another 17th-century Englishman, John Lilburne (known as Freeborn John), who came into conflict with both the monarchy of King Charles I and the military dictatorship of Oliver Cromwell governed republic, argued for level human basic rights he called \\"freeborn rights\\" which he defined as being rights that every human being is born with, as opposed to rights bestowed by government or by human law.\\r\\nThe distinction between alienable and unalienable rights was introduced by Francis Hutcheson. In his Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1725), Hutcheson foreshadowed the Declaration of Independence, stating: For wherever any Invasion is made upon unalienable Rights, there must arise either a perfect, or external Right to Resistance. . . . Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments. Hutcheson, however, placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights, declaring that there can be no Right, or Limitation of Right, inconsistent with, or opposite to the greatest publick Good.\\"[17] Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy (1755), based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience. One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment (e.g., about religious questions) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is \\"unalienable.\\" Hutcheson wrote: \\"Thus no man can really change his sentiments, judgments, and inward affections, at the pleasure of another; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart. The right of private judgment is therefore unalienable.\\"[18]\\r\\nIn the German Enlightenment, Hegel gave a highly developed treatment of this inalienability argument. Like Hutcheson, Hegel based the theory of inalienable rights on the de facto inalienability of those aspects of personhood that distinguish persons from things. A thing, like a piece of property, can in fact be transferred from one person to another. According to Hegel, the same would not apply to those aspects that make one a person:\\r\\nThe right to what is in essence inalienable is imprescriptible, since the act whereby I take possession of my personality, of my substantive essence, and make myself a responsible being, capable of possessing rights and with a moral and religious life, takes away from these characteristics of mine just that externality which alone made them capable of passing into the possession of someone else. When I have thus annulled their externality, I cannot lose them through lapse of time or from any other reason drawn from my prior consent or willingness to alienate them.[19]\\r\\nIn discussion of social contract theory, \\"inalienable rights\\" were said to be those rights that could not be surrendered by citizens to the sovereign. Such rights were thought to be natural rights, independent of positive law. Some social contract theorists reasoned, however, that in the natural state only the strongest could benefit from their rights. Thus, people form an implicit social contract, ceding their natural rights to the authority to protect the people from abuse, and living henceforth under the legal rights of that authority.\\r\\nMany historical apologies for slavery and illiberal government were based on explicit or implicit voluntary contracts to alienate any \\"natural rights\\" to freedom and self-determination.[20] The de facto inalienability arguments of Hutcheson and his predecessors provided the basis for the anti-slavery movement to argue not simply against involuntary slavery but against any explicit or implied contractual forms of slavery. Any contract that tried to legally alienate such a right would be inherently invalid. Similarly, the argument was used by the democratic movement to argue against any explicit or implied social contracts of subjection (pactum subjectionis) by which a people would supposedly alienate their right of self-government to a sovereign as, for example, in Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. According to Ernst Cassirer,\\r\\nThere is, at least, one right that cannot be ceded or abandoned: the right to personality...They charged the great logician [Hobbes] with a contradiction in terms. If a man could give up his personality he would cease being a moral being.  There is no pactum subjectionis, no act of submission by which man can give up the state of free agent and enslave himself. For by such an act of renunciation he would give up that very character which constitutes his nature and essence: he would lose his humanity.[21]\\r\\nThese themes converged in the debate about American Independence. While Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence, Richard Price in England sided with the Americans' claim \\"that Great Britain is attempting to rob them of that liberty to which every member of society and all civil communities have a natural and unalienable title.\\"[22]:67 Price again based the argument on the de facto inalienability of \\"that principle of spontaneity or self-determination which constitutes us agents or which gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly ours, and not effects of the operation of any foreign cause.\\"[22]:67ÿ68 Any social contract or compact allegedly alienating these rights would be non-binding and void, wrote Price:\\r\\nNeither can any state acquire such an authority over other states in virtue of any compacts or cessions. This is a case in which compacts are not binding. Civil liberty is, in this respect, on the same footing with religious liberty. As no people can lawfully surrender their religious liberty by giving up their right of judging for themselves in religion, or by allowing any human beings to prescribe to them what faith they shall embrace, or what mode of worship they shall practise, so neither can any civil societies lawfully surrender their civil liberty by giving up to any extraneous jurisdiction their power of legislating for themselves and disposing their property.[22]:78ÿ79\\r\\nPrice raised a furor of opposition so in 1777 he wrote another tract that clarified his position and again restated the de facto basis for the argument that the \\"liberty of men as agents is that power of self-determination which all agents, as such, possess.\\"[23] In Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism, Staughton Lynd pulled together these themes and related them to the slavery debate:\\r\\nThen it turned out to make considerable difference whether one said slavery was wrong because every man has a natural right to the possession of his own body, or because every man has a natural right freely to determine his own destiny. The first kind of right was alienable: thus Locke neatly derived slavery from capture in war, whereby a man forfeited his labor to the conqueror who might lawfully have killed him; and thus Dred Scott was judged permanently to have given up his freedom. But the second kind of right, what Price called \\"that power of self-determination which all agents, as such, possess,\\" was inalienable as long man remained man. Like the mind's quest for religious truth from which it was derived, self-determination was not a claim to ownership which might be both acquired and surrendered, but an inextricable aspect of the activity of being human.[24]\\r\\nMeanwhile, in America, Thomas Jefferson \\"took his division of rights into alienable and unalienable from Hutcheson, who made the distinction popular and important\\",[25] and in the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, famously condensed this to:\\r\\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the movement to abolish slavery seized this passage as a statement of constitutional principle, although the U.S. constitution recognized and protected slavery. As a lawyer, future Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase argued before the Supreme Court in the case of John Van Zandt, who had been charged with violating the Fugitive Slave Act, that:\\r\\nThe law of the Creator, which invests every human being with an inalienable title to freedom, cannot be repealed by any interior law which asserts that man is property.\\r\\nThe concept of inalienable rights was criticized by Jeremy Bentham and Edmund Burke as groundless. Bentham and Burke, writing in 18th century Britain, claimed that rights arise from the actions of government, or evolve from tradition, and that neither of these can provide anything inalienable. (See Bentham's \\"Critique of the Doctrine of Inalienable, Natural Rights\\", and Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France). Presaging the shift in thinking in the 19th century, Bentham famously dismissed the idea of natural rights as \\"nonsense on stilts\\". By way of contrast to the views of British nationals Burke and Bentham, the leading American revolutionary scholar James Wilson condemned Burke's view as \\"tyranny.\\"[26]\\r\\nThe signers of the Declaration of Independence deemed it a \\"self-evident truth\\" that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\\". In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims that the existence of inalienable rights is unnecessary for the existence of a constitution or a set of laws and rights. This idea of a social contract?ÿ that rights and responsibilities are derived from a consensual contract between the government and the people?ÿ is the most widely recognized alternative.\\r\\nOne criticism of natural rights theory is that one cannot draw norms from facts.[27] This objection is variously expressed as the is-ought problem, the naturalistic fallacy, or the appeal to nature. G.E. Moore, for example, said that ethical naturalism falls prey to the naturalistic fallacy.[citation needed] Some defenders of natural rights theory, however, counter that the term \\"natural\\" in \\"natural rights\\" is contrasted with \\"artificial\\" rather than referring to nature. John Finnis, for example, contends that natural law and natural rights are derived from self-evident principles, not from speculative principles or from facts.[27]\\r\\nThere is also debate as to whether all rights are either natural or legal. Fourth president of the United States James Madison, while representing Virginia in the House of Representatives, believed that there are rights, such as trial by jury, that are social rights, arising neither from natural law nor from positive law (which are the basis of natural and legal rights respectively) but from the social contract from which a government derives its authority.[28]\\r\\nThomas Hobbes (1588ÿ1679) included a discussion of natural rights in his moral and political philosophy. Hobbes' conception of natural rights extended from his conception of man in a \\"state of nature\\". Thus he argued that the essential natural (human) right was \\"to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life; and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own judgement, and Reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto.\\" (Leviathan. 1, XIV)\\r\\nHobbes sharply distinguished this natural \\"liberty\\", from natural \\"laws\\", described generally as \\"a precept, or general rule, found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving his life; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may best be preserved.\\" (Leviathan. 1, XIV)\\r\\nIn his natural state, according to Hobbes, man's life consisted entirely of liberties and not at all of laws ÿ \\"It followeth, that in such a condition, every man has the right to every thing; even to one another's body. And therefore, as long as this natural Right of every man to every thing endureth, there can be no security to any man... of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily allow men to live.\\" (Leviathan. 1, XIV)\\r\\nThis would lead inevitably to a situation known as the \\"war of all against all\\", in which human beings kill, steal and enslave others in order to stay alive, and due to their natural lust for \\"Gain\\", \\"Safety\\" and \\"Reputation\\". Hobbes reasoned that this world of chaos created by unlimited rights was highly undesirable, since it would cause human life to be \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\\". As such, if humans wish to live peacefully they must give up most of their natural rights and create moral obligations in order to establish political and civil society. This is one of the earliest formulations of the theory of government known as the social contract.\\r\\nHobbes objected to the attempt to derive rights from \\"natural law,\\" arguing that law (\\"lex\\") and right (\\"jus\\") though often confused, signify opposites, with law referring to obligations, while rights refer to the absence of obligations. Since by our (human) nature, we seek to maximize our well being, rights are prior to law, natural or institutional, and people will not follow the laws of nature without first being subjected to a sovereign power, without which all ideas of right and wrong are meaningless ÿ \\"Therefore before the names of Just and Unjust can have place, there must be some coercive Power, to compel men equally to the performance of their Covenants..., to make good that Propriety, which by mutual contract men acquire, in recompense of the universal Right they abandon: and such power there is none before the erection of the Commonwealth.\\" (Leviathan. 1, XV)\\r\\nThis marked an important departure from medieval natural law theories which gave precedence to obligations over rights.\\r\\nJohn Locke (1632 ÿ 1704) was another prominent Western philosopher who conceptualized rights as natural and inalienable. Like Hobbes, Locke believed in a natural right to life, liberty, and property. It was once conventional wisdom that Locke greatly influenced the American Revolutionary War with his writings of natural rights, but this claim has been the subject of protracted dispute in recent decades. For example, the historian Ray Forrest Harvey declared that Jefferson and Locke were at \\"two opposite poles\\" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jeffersons use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase \\"pursuit of happiness\\" instead of \\"property.\\"[29] More recently, the eminent[30] legal historian John Phillip Reid has deplored contemporary scholars \\"misplaced emphasis on John Locke,\\" arguing that American revolutionary leaders saw Locke as a commentator on established constitutional principles.[31][32] Thomas Pangle has defended Locke's influence on the Founding, claiming that historians who argue to the contrary either misrepresent the classical republican alternative to which they say the revolutionary leaders adhered, do not understand Locke, or point to someone else who was decisively influenced by Locke.[33] This position has also been sustained by Michael Zuckert.[34][35][36]\\r\\nAccording to Locke there are three natural rights:\\r\\nIn developing his concept of natural rights, Locke was influenced by reports of society among Native Americans, whom he regarded as \\"natural peoples\\" who lived in a state of liberty and \\"near prefect freedom\\", but not license.[38] It also informed his conception of social contract.\\r\\nThe social contract is an agreement between members of a country to live within a shared system of laws. Specific forms of government are the result of the decisions made by these persons acting in their collective capacity. Government is instituted to make laws that protect these three natural rights. If a government does not properly protect these rights, it can be overthrown.\\r\\nThomas Paine (1731ÿ1809) further elaborated on natural rights in his influential work Rights of Man (1791), emphasizing that rights cannot be granted by any charter because this would legally imply they can also be revoked and under such circumstances they would be reduced to privileges:\\r\\nIt is a perversion of terms to say that a charter gives rights. It operates by a contrary effect ÿ that of taking rights away. Rights are inherently in all the inhabitants; but charters, by annulling those rights, in the majority, leave the right, by exclusion, in the hands of a few.  They...consequently are instruments of injustice.\\r\\nThe fact therefore must be that the individuals themselves, each in his own personal and sovereign right, entered into a compact with each other to produce a government: and this is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise, and the only principle on which they have a right to exist.\\r\\nWhile at first American individualist anarchists adhered to natural rights positions, later in this era led by Benjamin Tucker, some abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner's Egoist anarchism. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said there were only two rights: \\"the right of might\\" and \\"the right of contract\\".[citation needed] He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, \\"In times past... it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off.... Man's only right to land is his might over it.\\"[39]\\r\\nAccording to Wendy McElroy:\\r\\nIn adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of Liberty in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.[40]\\r\\nSeveral periodicals were \\"undoubtedly influenced by Liberty's presentation of egoism, including I published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of Liberty); The Ego and The Egoist, both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German Der Eigene, edited by Adolf Brand, and The Eagle and The Serpent, issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology'\\".[40] Among those American anarchists who adhered to egoism include Benjamin Tucker, John Beverley Robinson, Steven T. Byington, Hutchins Hapgood, James L. Walker, Victor Yarros and E.H. Fulton.[40]\\r\\nMany documents now echo the phrase used in the United States Declaration of Independence. The preamble to the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that rights are inalienable: \\"recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\\" Article 1, ?1 of the California Constitution recognizes inalienable rights, and articulated some (not all) of those rights as \\"defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.\\" However, there is still much dispute over which \\"rights\\" are truly natural rights and which are not, and the concept of natural or inalienable rights is still controversial to some.\\r\\nErich Fromm argued that some powers over human beings could be wielded only by God, and that if there were no God, no human beings could wield these powers.[41]\\r\\nContemporary political philosophies continuing the classical liberal tradition of natural rights include libertarianism, anarcho-capitalism and Objectivism, and include amongst their canon the works of authors such as Robert Nozick, Ludwig von Mises, Ayn Rand,[42] and Murray Rothbard.[43] A libertarian view of inalienable rights is laid out in Morris and Linda Tannehill's The Market for Liberty, which claims that a man has a right to ownership over his life and therefore also his property, because he has invested time (i.e. part of his life) in it and thereby made it an extension of his life. However, if he initiates force against and to the detriment of another man, he alienates himself from the right to that part of his life which is required to pay his debt: \\"Rights are not inalienable, but only the possessor of a right can alienate himself from that right ÿ no one else can take a man's rights from him.\\"[44]\\r\\nVarious definitions of inalienability include non-relinquishability, non-salability, and non-transferability.[45] This concept has been recognized by libertarians as being central to the question of voluntary slavery, which Murray Rothbard dismissed as illegitimate and even self-contradictory.[46] Stephan Kinsella argues that \\"viewing rights as alienable is perfectly consistent with ÿ indeed, implied by ÿ the libertarian non-aggression principle. Under this principle, only the initiation of force is prohibited; defensive, restitutive, or retaliatory force is not.\\"[47]\\r\\nVarious philosophers have created different lists of rights they consider to be natural. Proponents of natural rights, in particular Hesselberg and Rothbard, have responded that reason can be applied to separate truly axiomatic rights from supposed rights, stating that any principle that requires itself to be disproved is an axiom. Critics have pointed to the lack of agreement between the proponents as evidence for the claim that the idea of natural rights is merely a political tool.\\r\\nHugh Gibbons has proposed a descriptive argument based on human biology. His contention is that Human Beings were other-regarding as a matter of necessity, in order to avoid the costs of conflict. Over time they developed expectations that individuals would act in certain ways which were then prescribed by society (duties of care etc.) and that eventually crystallized into actionable rights.[48]","input":"Who first described the idea of natural rights?"},{"output":"the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts","context":"The Muses are the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts in Greek mythology. They were considered the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, lyric songs, and myths that were related orally for centuries in these ancient cultures. They were later adopted by the Romans as a part of their pantheon.\\r\\nIn current English usage, \\"muse\\" can refer in general to a person who inspires an artist, musician, or writer.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Muses /?mju?z?z/ (Ancient?Greek: ?ϫ, Mo?sai) perhaps came from the o-grade of the Proto-Indo-European root *men- (\\"to think\\")[2] or from root *men- (\\"to tower, mountain\\") since all the most important cult-centres of the Muses were on mountains or hills.[3]\\r\\nThe earliest known records of the Nine Muses are from Boeotia, the homeland of Hesiod. Some ancient authorities thought that the Nine Muses were of Thracian origin.[4] There, a tradition persisted that the Muses had once been three in number.[5] In the first century BC, Diodorus Siculus quotes Hesiod to the contrary, observing:\\r\\nWriters similarly disagree also concerning the number of the Muses; for some say that there are three, and others that there are nine, but the number nine has prevailed since it rests upon the authority of the most distinguished men, such as Homer and Hesiod and others like them.[6]\\r\\nDiodorus also states (Book I.18) that Osiris first recruited the nine Muses, along with the Satyrs, while passing through Ethiopia, before embarking on a tour of all Asia and Europe, teaching the arts of cultivation wherever he went. According to Hesiod's account (c. 600 BC), generally followed by the writers of antiquity, the Nine Muses were the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (i.?e. \\"Memory\\" personified), figuring as personifications of knowledge and the arts, especially literature, dance and music.\\r\\nThe Roman scholar Varro (116ÿ27 BC) relates that there are only three Muses: one born from the movement of water, another who makes sound by striking the air, and a third who is embodied only in the human voice. They were called Melete or \\"Practice\\", Mneme or \\"Memory\\" and Aoide or \\"Song\\". Three ancient Muses were also reported in Plutarch's (46ÿ120 AD) Quaestiones Convivales[7] (9.I4.2ÿ4).[8]\\r\\nHowever, the classical understanding of the Muses tripled their triad and established a set of nine goddesses, who embody the arts and inspire creation with their graces through remembered and improvised song and mime, writing, traditional music, and dance. It was not until Hellenistic times that the following systematic set of functions was assigned to them, and even then there was some variation in both their names and their attributes: Calliope (epic poetry), Clio (history), Euterpe (flutes and lyric poetry), Thalia (comedy and pastoral poetry), Melpomene (tragedy), Terpsichore (dance), Erato (love poetry), Polyhymnia (sacred poetry), Urania (astronomy).\\r\\nAccording to Pausanias in the later second century AD,[9] there were three original Muses, worshiped on Mount Helicon in Boeotia: Aoid? (\\"song\\" or \\"tune\\"), Melt (\\"practice\\" or \\"occasion\\"), and Mn?m (\\"memory\\"). Together, these three form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice. In Delphi three Muses were worshiped as well, but with other names: N?t, Ms, and Hypat, which are assigned as the names of the three cords of the ancient musical instrument, the lyre. Alternatively they later were called Kphis?, Apollns, and Borysthens, which names characterize them as daughters of Apollo. In later tradition, a set of four Muses were recognized: Thelxin܇, Aoid? Arch, and Melt, said to be daughters of Zeus and Plusia or of Uranus.\\r\\nOne of the people frequently associated with the Muses was Pierus. By some he was called the father (by a Pimpleian nymph, called Antiope by Cicero) of a total of seven Muses, called Neil? (?), Trit?n (?), Asp? (??), Heptpora (??ϫ), Achels, Tipopl? (?), and Rhoda (?Ѵ?ϫ).[10]\\r\\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony (seventh century BC), they were daughters of Zeus, the second generation king of the gods, and the offspring of Mnemosyne, goddess of memory. For Alcman and Mimnermus, they were even more primordial, springing from the early deities, Uranus and Gaia. Gaia is Mother Earth, an early mother goddess who was worshipped at Delphi from prehistoric times, long before the site was rededicated to Apollo, possibly indicating a transfer to association with him after that time.\\r\\nSometimes the Muses are referred to as water nymphs, associated with the springs of Helicon and with Pieris. It was said that the winged horse Pegasus touched his hooves to the ground on Helicon, causing four sacred springs to burst forth, from which the Muses were born.[11] Athena later tamed the horse and presented him to the Muses. (Compare the Roman inspiring nymphs of springs, the Camenae, the V?lva of Norse Mythology and also the apsaras in the mythology of classical India.)\\r\\nClassical writers set Apollo as their leader, Apollon Mousagets (\\"Apollo Muse-leader\\").[12] In one myth, the Muses judged a contest between Apollo and Marsyas. They also gathered the pieces of the dead body of Orpheus, son of Calliope, and buried them in Leivithra. In a later myth, Thamyris challenged them to a singing contest. They won and punished Thamyris by blinding him and robbing him of his singing ability.\\r\\nAccording to a myth from Ovid's Metamorphosesalluding to the connection of the Muses with PieriaKing Pierus, king of Macedon, had nine daughters he named after the nine Muses, believing that their skills were a great match to the Muses. He thus challenged the Muses to a match, resulting in his daughters, the Pierides, being turned into chattering magpies for their presumption.[13]\\r\\nPausanias records a tradition of two generations of Muses; the first are the daughters of Uranus and Gaia, the second of Zeus and Mnemosyne. Another, rarer genealogy is that they are daughters of Harmonia (the daughter of Aphrodite and Ares), which contradicts the myth in which they were dancing at the wedding of Harmonia and Cadmus.\\r\\nSome Greek writers give the names of the nine Muses as Kallichore, Helike, Eunike, Thelxino?, Terpsichore, Euterpe, Eukelade, Dia, and Enope.[14]\\r\\nIn Renaissance and Neoclassical art, the dissemination of emblem books such as Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (1593 and many further editions) helped standardize the depiction of the Muses in sculpture and painting, so they could be distinguished by certain props. These props, or emblems, became readily identifiable by the viewer, enabling one immediately to recognize the Muse and the art with which she had become associated. Here again, Calliope (epic poetry) carries a writing tablet; Clio (history) carries a scroll and books; Euterpe (song and elegiac poetry) carries a flute, the aulos; Erato (lyric poetry) is often seen with a lyre and a crown of roses; Melpomene (tragedy) is often seen with a tragic mask; Polyhymnia (sacred poetry) is often seen with a pensive expression; Terpsichore (choral dance and song) is often seen dancing and carrying a lyre; Thalia (comedy) is often seen with a comic mask; and Urania (astronomy) carries a pair of compasses and the celestial globe.\\r\\nGreek mousa is a common noun as well as a type of goddess: it literally means \\"art\\" or \\"poetry\\". According to Pindar, to \\"carry a mousa\\" is \\"to excel in the arts\\". The word probably derives from the Indo-European root men-, which is also the source of Greek Mnemosyne, English \\"mind\\", \\"mental\\" and \\"memory\\" and Sanskrit \\"mantra\\"[citation needed].\\r\\nThe Muses, therefore, were both the embodiments and sponsors of performed metrical speech: mousike (whence the English term \\"music\\") was just \\"one of the arts of the Muses\\". Others included Science, Geography, Mathematics, Philosophy, and especially Art, Drama, and inspiration. In the archaic period, before the widespread availability of books (scrolls), this included nearly all of learning. The first Greek book on astronomy, by Thales, took the form of dactylic hexameters, as did many works of pre-Socratic philosophy. Both Plato and the Pythagoreans explicitly included philosophy as a sub-species of mousike.[15] The Histories of Herodotus, whose primary medium of delivery was public recitation, were divided by Alexandrian editors into nine books, named after the nine Muses.\\r\\nFor poet and \\"law-giver\\" Solon,[16] the Muses were \\"the key to the good life\\"; since they brought both prosperity and friendship. Solon sought to perpetuate his political reforms by establishing recitations of his poetrycomplete with invocations to his practical-minded Musesby Athenian boys at festivals each year. He believed that the Muses would help inspire people to do their best.\\r\\nAncient authors and their imitators invoke Muses when writing poetry, hymns or epic history. The invocation occurs near the beginning of their work. It asks for help or inspiration from the Muses, or simply invites the Muse to sing directly through the author.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the invocation of the Muse was an indication that the speaker was working inside the poetic tradition, according to the established formulas. For example:\\r\\nSing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns\\r\\ndriven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy.\\r\\nO Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;\\r\\nWhat goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate; For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began To persecute so brave, so just a man; [...]\\r\\nBesides Homer and Virgil, other famous works that included an invocation of the Muse are the first of the carmina by Catullus, Ovid's Metamorphoses and Amores, Dante's Inferno (Canto II), Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde (Book II), Shakespeare's Henry V (Act 1, Prologue), his 38th sonnet, and Milton's Paradise Lost (opening of Book 1).\\r\\nWhen Pythagoras arrived at Croton, his first advice to the Crotoniates was to build a shrine to the Muses at the center of the city, to promote civic harmony and learning. Local cults of the Muses often became associated with springs or with fountains. The Muses themselves were sometimes called Aganippids because of their association with a fountain called Aganippe. Other fountains, Hippocrene and Pirene, were also important locations associated with the Muses. Some sources occasionally referred to the Muses as \\"Corycides\\" (or \\"Corycian nymphs\\") after a cave on Mount Parnassos, called the Corycian Cave. The Muses were venerated especially in Boeotia, in the Valley of the Muses near Helicon, and in Delphi and the Parnassus, where Apollo became known as Mousagetes (\\"Muse-leader\\") after the sites were rededicated to his cult.\\r\\nOften Muse-worship was associated with the hero-cults of poets: the tombs of Archilochus on Thasos and of Hesiod and Thamyris in Boeotia all played host to festivals in which poetic recitations accompanied sacrifices to the Muses. The Library of Alexandria and its circle of scholars formed around a mousaion (i.?e. \\"museum\\" or shrine of the Muses) close to the tomb of Alexander the Great. Many Enlightenment figures sought to re-establish a \\"Cult of the Muses\\" in the 18th century. A famous Masonic lodge in pre-Revolutionary Paris was called Les Neuf Soeurs (\\"The Nine Sisters\\", that is, the Nine Muses); Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Danton, and other influential Enlightenment figures attended it. As a side-effect of this movement the word \\"museum\\" (originally, \\"cult place of the Muses\\") came to refer to a place for the public display of knowledge.\\r\\nNot only are the Muses explicitly used in modern English to refer to an artistic inspiration, as when one cites one's own artistic muse, but they also are implicit in words and phrases such as \\"amuse\\", \\"museum\\" (Latinised from mouseiona place where the Muses were worshipped), \\"music\\", and \\"musing upon\\".[17] In current literature, the influential role that the Muse plays has been extended to the political sphere.[18] Along with a majority of the Greek Gods, five of the Muses (Thalia, Clio, Calliope, Melpomene and Terpsicore) appeared in the Walt Disney animated film Hercules (based on Hercules), where they narrate the film through song and dance. These versions of the Muses are modeled after African American Gospel singers. All nine Muses appeared in several paintings in the 72-piece art collection of Dante's Inferno by Dino Di Durante, which is printed in books titled Inferno: The Art Collection and available in 33 languages. This said collection was also featured in the medium length film Dante's Hell Animated by Boris Acosta.\\r\\nThere is a modern tendency to speak of Kinema as the tenth Muse.[19]\\r\\nTerpsichore\\r\\nErato\\r\\nClio\\r\\nThalia\\r\\nPolyhymnia\\r\\nCalliope\\r\\nApollo and the Muses\\r\\nEuterpe\\r\\nParnassus\\r\\nUrania and Melpomene","input":"Who were the nine muses in greek mythology?"},{"output":"Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","context":"Formula Rossa (Arabic: ??????? ????) is a launched roller coaster located at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

The Earth's field has alternated between periods of normal polarity, in which the predominant direction of the field was the same as the present direction, and reverse polarity, in which it was the opposite. These periods are called chrons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time spans of chrons are randomly distributed with most being between 0.1 and 1?million years[citation needed] with an average of 450,000 years. Most reversals are estimated to take between 1,000 and 10,000 years.\\r\\nThe latest one, the BrunhesÿMatuyama reversal, occurred 780,000 years ago, and may have happened very quickly, within a human lifetime.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nA brief complete reversal, known as the Laschamp event, occurred only 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. That reversal lasted only about 440 years with the actual change of polarity lasting around 250 years. During this change the strength of the magnetic field weakened to 5% of its present strength.[2] Brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called geomagnetic excursions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, geologists first noticed that some volcanic rocks were magnetized opposite to the direction of the local Earth's field. The first estimate of the timing of magnetic reversals was made by Motonori Matuyama in the 1920s; he observed that rocks with reversed fields were all of early Pleistocene age or older. At the time, the Earth's polarity was poorly understood, and the possibility of reversal aroused little interest.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree decades later, when Earth's magnetic field was better understood, theories were advanced suggesting that the Earth's field might have reversed in the remote past. Most paleomagnetic research in the late 1950s included an examination of the wandering of the poles and continental drift. Although it was discovered that some rocks would reverse their magnetic field while cooling, it became apparent that most magnetized volcanic rocks preserved traces of the Earth's magnetic field at the time the rocks had cooled. In the absence of reliable methods for obtaining absolute ages for rocks, it was thought that reversals occurred approximately every million years.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next major advance in understanding reversals came when techniques for radiometric dating were developed in the 1950s. Allan Cox and Richard Doell, at the United States Geological Survey, wanted to know whether reversals occurred at regular intervals, and invited the geochronologist Brent Dalrymple to join their group. They produced the first magnetic-polarity time scale in 1959. As they accumulated data, they continued to refine this scale in competition with Don Tarling and Ian McDougall at the Australian National University. A group led by Neil Opdyke at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory showed that the same pattern of reversals was recorded in sediments from deep-sea cores.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s information about variations in the Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels. But the complex routes of ocean cruises rendered the association of navigational data with magnetometer readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared on the ocean floors.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews provided a simple explanation by combining the seafloor spreading theory of Harry Hess with the known time scale of reversals: new sea floor is magnetized in the direction of the then-current field. Thus, sea floor spreading from a central ridge will produce pairs of magnetic stripes parallel to the ridge.[5] Canadian L. W. Morley independently proposed a similar explanation in January 1963, but his work was rejected by the scientific journals Nature and Journal of Geophysical Research, and remained unpublished until 1967, when it appeared in the literary magazine Saturday Review.[3] The MorleyÿVineÿMatthews hypothesis was the first key scientific test of the seafloor spreading theory of continental drift.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1966, LamontÿDoherty Geological Observatory scientists found that the magnetic profiles across the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge were symmetrical and matched the pattern in the north Atlantic's Reykjanes ridge. The same magnetic anomalies were found over most of the world's oceans, which permitted estimates for when most of the oceanic crust had developed.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPast field reversals can be and have been recorded in the \\"frozen\\" ferromagnetic (or, more accurately, ferrimagnetic) minerals of consolidated sedimentary deposits or cooled volcanic flows on land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe past record of geomagnetic reversals was first noticed by observing the magnetic stripe \\"anomalies\\" on the ocean floor. Lawrence W. Morley, Frederick John Vine and Drummond Hoyle Matthews made the connection to seafloor spreading in the Morley-Vine-Matthews hypothesis[5][6] which soon led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics. The relatively constant rate at which the sea floor spreads results in substrate \\"stripes\\" from which past magnetic field polarity can be inferred from data gathered from towing a magnetometer along the sea floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause no existing unsubducted sea floor (or sea floor thrust onto continental plates) is more than about 180 million years (Ma) old, other methods are necessary for detecting older reversals. Most sedimentary rocks incorporate tiny amounts of iron rich minerals, whose orientation is influenced by the ambient magnetic field at the time at which they formed. These rocks can preserve a record of the field if it is not later erased by chemical, physical or biological change.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the magnetic field is global, similar patterns of magnetic variations at different sites may be used to correlate age in different locations. In the past four decades much paleomagnetic data about seafloor ages (up to ~250  Ma) has been collected and is useful in estimating the age of geologic sections. Not an independent dating method, it depends on \\"absolute\\" age dating methods like radioisotopic systems to derive numeric ages. It has become especially useful to metamorphic and igneous geologists where index fossils are seldom available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough analysis of seafloor magnetic anomalies and dating of reversal sequences on land, paleomagnetists have been developing a Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS). The current time scale contains 184 polarity intervals in the last 83?million years.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rate of reversals in the Earth's magnetic field has varied widely over time. 72 million years ago (Ma), the field reversed 5 times in a million years. In a 4-million-year period centered on 54  Ma, there were 10 reversals; at around 42  Ma, 17 reversals took place in the span of 3?million years. In a period of 3?million years centering on 24  Ma, 13 reversals occurred. No fewer than 51 reversals occurred in a 12-million-year period, centering on 15?million years ago. Two reversals occurred during a span of 50,000 years. These eras of frequent reversals have been counterbalanced by a few \\"superchrons\\" ÿ long periods when no reversals took place.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA superchron is a polarity interval lasting at least 10?million years. There are two well-established superchrons, the Cretaceous Normal  and the Kiaman. A third candidate, the Moyero, is more controversial. The Jurassic Quiet Zone in ocean magnetic anomalies was once thought to represent a superchron, but is now attributed to other causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cretaceous Normal (also called the Cretaceous Superchron or C34) lasted for almost 40?million years, from about 120?to?83 million years ago, including stages of the Cretaceous period from the Aptian through the Santonian. The frequency of magnetic reversals steadily decreased prior to the period, reaching its low point (no reversals) during the period. Between the Cretaceous Normal and the present, the frequency has generally increased slowly.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kiaman Reverse Superchron lasted from approximately the late Carboniferous to the late Permian, or for more than 50?million years, from around 312?to?262 million years ago.[10] The magnetic field had reversed polarity. The name \\"Kiaman\\" derives from the Australian village of Kiama, where some of the first geological evidence of the superchron was found in 1925.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ordovician is suspected to have hosted another superchron, called the Moyero Reverse Superchron, lasting more than 20?million years (485 to 463?million years ago). Thus far, this possible superchron has only been found in the Moyero river section north of the polar circle in Siberia.[12] Moreover, the best data from elsewhere in the world do not show evidence for this superchron.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain regions of ocean floor, older than 160 Ma, have low-amplitude magnetic anomalies that are hard to interpret. They are found off the east coast of North America, the northwest coast of Africa, and the western Pacific. They were once thought to represent a superchron called the Jurassic Quiet Zone, but magnetic anomalies are found on land during this period. The geomagnetic field is known to have low intensity between about 130 Ma and 170 Ma, and these sections of ocean floor are especially deep, causing the geomagnetic signal to be attenuated between the seabed and the surface.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral studies have analyzed the statistical properties of reversals in the hope of learning something about their underlying mechanism. The discriminating power of statistical tests is limited by the small number of polarity intervals. Nevertheless, some general features are well established. In particular, the pattern of reversals is random. There is no correlation between the lengths of polarity intervals.[14] There is no preference for either normal or reversed polarity, and no statistical difference between the distributions of these polarities. This lack of bias is also a robust prediction of dynamo theory.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no rate of reversals, as they are statistically random. The randomness of the reversals is inconsistent with periodicity, but several authors have claimed to find periodicity.[15] However, these results are probably artifacts of an analysis using sliding windows to attempt to determine reversal rates.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost statistical models of reversals have analyzed them in terms of a Poisson process or other kinds of renewal process. A Poisson process would have, on average, a constant reversal rate, so it is common to use a non-stationary Poisson process. However, compared to a Poisson process, there is a reduced probability of reversal for tens of thousands of years after a reversal. This could be due to an inhibition in the underlying mechanism, or it could just mean that some shorter polarity intervals have been missed.[10] A random reversal pattern with inhibition can be represented by a gamma process. In 2006, a team of physicists at the University of Calabria found that the reversals also conform to a Lvy distribution, which describes stochastic processes with long-ranging correlations between events in time.[17][18] The data are also consistent with a deterministic, but chaotic, process.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost estimates for the duration of a polarity transition are between 1,000 and 10,000 years,[10] but some estimates are as quick as a human lifetime.[1]\\r\\nStudies of 15-million-year-old lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the Earth's magnetic field is capable of shifting at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day.[20] This was initially met with skepticism from paleomagnetists. Even if changes occur that quickly in the core, the mantle, which is a semiconductor, is thought to remove variations with periods less than a few months. A variety of possible rock magnetic mechanisms were proposed that would lead to a false signal.[21] However, paleomagnetic studies of other sections from the same region (the Oregon Plateau flood basalts) give consistent results.[22][23] It appears that the reversed-to-normal polarity transition that marks the end of Chron C5Cr (16.7?million years ago) contains a series of reversals and excursions.[24] In addition, geologists Scott Bogue of Occidental College and Jonathan Glen of the US Geological Survey, sampling lava flows in Battle Mountain, Nevada, found evidence for a brief, several-year-long interval during a reversal when the field direction changed by over 50 degrees. The reversal was dated to approximately 15?million years ago.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe magnetic field will not vanish completely, but many poles might form chaotically in different places during reversal, until it stabilizes again.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe magnetic field of the Earth, and of other planets that have magnetic fields, is generated by dynamo action in which convection of molten iron in the planetary core generates electric currents which in turn give rise to magnetic fields.[10] In simulations of planetary dynamos, reversals often emerge spontaneously from the underlying dynamics. For example, Gary Glatzmaier and collaborator Paul Roberts of UCLA ran a numerical model of the coupling between electromagnetism and fluid dynamics in the Earth's interior. Their simulation reproduced key features of the magnetic field over more than 40,000 years of simulated time and the computer-generated field reversed itself.[29][30] Global field reversals at irregular intervals have also been observed in the laboratory liquid metal experiment \\"VKS2\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some simulations, this leads to an instability in which the magnetic field spontaneously flips over into the opposite orientation. This scenario is supported by observations of the solar magnetic field, which undergoes spontaneous reversals every 9ÿ12 years. However, with the Sun it is observed that the solar magnetic intensity greatly increases during a reversal, whereas reversals on Earth seem to occur during periods of low field strength.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome scientists, such as Richard A. Muller, think that geomagnetic reversals are not spontaneous processes but rather are triggered by external events that directly disrupt the flow in the Earth's core. Proposals include impact events[33][34] or internal events such as the arrival of continental slabs carried down into the mantle by the action of plate tectonics at subduction zones or the initiation of new mantle plumes from the core-mantle boundary.[35] Supporters of this hypothesis hold that any of these events could lead to a large scale disruption of the dynamo, effectively turning off the geomagnetic field. Because the magnetic field is stable in either the present North-South orientation or a reversed orientation, they propose that when the field recovers from such a disruption it spontaneously chooses one state or the other, such that half the recoveries become reversals. However, the proposed mechanism does not appear to work in a quantitative model, and the evidence from stratigraphy for a correlation between reversals and impact events is weak. There is no evidence for a reversal connected with the impact event that caused the CretaceousÿPaleogene extinction event.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the first geomagnetic polarity time scales were produced, scientists began exploring the possibility that reversals could be linked to extinctions. Most such proposals rest on the assumption that the Earth's magnetic field would be much weaker during reversals. Possibly the first such hypothesis was that high energy particles trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt could be liberated and bombard the Earth.[37][38] Detailed calculations confirm that if the Earth's dipole field disappeared entirely (leaving the quadrupole and higher components), most of the atmosphere would become accessible to high energy particles, but would act as a barrier to them, and cosmic ray collisions would produce secondary radiation of beryllium-10 or chlorine-36. An increase of beryllium-10 was noted in a 2012 German study showing a peak of beryllium-10 in Greenland ice cores during a brief complete reversal 41,000 years ago which led to the magnetic field strength dropping to an estimated 5% of normal during the reversal.[2] There is evidence that this occurs both during secular variation[39][40] and during reversals.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother hypothesis by McCormac and Evans assumes that the Earth's field disappears entirely during reversals.[43] They argue that the atmosphere of Mars may have been eroded away by the solar wind because it had no magnetic field to protect it. They predict that ions would be stripped away from Earth's atmosphere above 100?km. However, paleointensity measurements show that the magnetic field has not disappeared during reversals. Based on paleointensity data for the last 800,000 years,[44] the magnetopause is still estimated to have been at about 3 Earth radii during the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal.[37] Even if the internal magnetic field did disappear, the solar wind can induce a magnetic field in the Earth's ionosphere sufficient to shield the surface from energetic particles.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nHypotheses have also advanced toward linking reversals to mass extinctions.[46]  Many such arguments were based on an apparent periodicity in the rate of reversals, but more careful analyses show that the reversal record is not periodic.[16]\\r\\nIt may be, however, that the ends of superchrons have caused vigorous convection leading to widespread volcanism, and that the subsequent airborne ash caused extinctions.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nTests of correlations between extinctions and reversals are difficult for a number of reasons. Larger animals are too scarce in the fossil record for good statistics, so paleontologists have analyzed microfossil extinctions. Even microfossil data can be unreliable if there are hiatuses in the fossil record. It can appear that the extinction occurs at the end of a polarity interval when the rest of that polarity interval was simply eroded away.[21]  Statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between reversals and extinctions.[48][37]","input":"How long ago was the last time earth's magnetic field reversed?"},{"output":"July 7, 1898","context":"Hawaiian League / United States victory\\r\\nThe overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii began on January 17, 1893, with a coup d'tat against Queen Liliuokalani on the island of Oahu by foreign residents residing in Honolulu, mostly United States citizens, and subjects of the Kingdom of Hawaii.[4] They prevailed upon American minister John L. Stevens to call in the U.S. Marines to protect American interests, an action that effectively buttressed the rebellion. The revolutionaries established the Republic of Hawaii, but their ultimate goal was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which finally occurred in 1898.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kamehameha Dynasty was the reigning monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii, beginning with its founding by Kamehameha I in 1795, until the death of Kamehameha V in 1872 and Lunalilo in 1874.[5][6] On July 6, 1846, U.S. Secretary of State John C. Calhoun, on behalf of President Tyler, afforded formal recognition of Hawaiian independence under the reign of Kamehameha III.[7] As a result of the recognition of Hawaiian independence, the Hawaiian Kingdom entered into treaties with the major nations of the world[8] and established over ninety legations and consulates in multiple seaports and cities.[9] The kingdom would continue for another 21 years until its overthrow in 1893 with the fall of the House of Kalkaua.[10]\\r\\nSugar had been a major export from Hawaii since Captain James Cook's arrival in 1778.[11] The first permanent plantation in the islands was on Kauai in 1835. William Hooper leased 980 acres of land from Kamehameha III and began growing sugar cane. Within thirty years there would be plantations on four of the main islands. Sugar had completely altered Hawaii's economy.[12]\\r\\nAmerican influence in Hawaiian government began with American-born plantation owners demanding a say in Kingdom politics. This was driven by missionary religion and the economics of the sugar industry. Pressure from these foreign born politicians was being felt by the King and chiefs with demands of land tenure. After the 1843 takeover by the British, Kamehameha III relented to the foreign advisors to private land demands with the Great Mhele, distributing the lands as pushed on heavily by the missionaries, including Gerrit P. Judd.[13] During the 1850s, the U.S. import tariff on sugar from Hawaii was much higher than the import tariffs Hawaiians were charging the U.S., and Kamehameha III sought reciprocity.[14] The monarch wished to lower the tariffs being paid out to the U.S. while still maintaining the Kingdom's sovereignty and making Hawaiian sugar competitive with other foreign markets. In 1854 Kamehameha III proposed a policy of reciprocity between the countries but the proposal died in the U.S. Senate.[15]\\r\\nAs early as 1873, a United States military commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island in exchange for the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S.[16] Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. American control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor.[17] The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.[17]\\r\\nLunalilo left no heirs. The legislature was empowered by the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances[18] and chose David Kalkaua as the next monarch.[19] The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy.[19] Kalkaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravention of the traditions of the Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('ina) was fertile, sacred, and not for sale to anyone.[19] In 1874 through 1875, Kalkaua traveled to the United States for a state visit to Washington DC to help gain support for a new treaty.[20][21] Congress agreed to the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 for seven years in exchange for Ford Island.[22][23] After the treaty, sugar production expanded from 12,000 acres of farm land to 125,000 acres in 1891.[24] At the end of the seven-year reciprocity agreement, the United States showed little interest in renewal.[22]\\r\\nOn January 20, 1887, the United States began leasing Pearl Harbor.[25] Shortly afterwards, a group of mostly non-Hawaiians calling themselves the Hawaiian Patriotic League began the Rebellion of 1887.[26] They drafted their own constitution on July 6, 1887.[27] The new constitution was written by Lorrin Thurston, the Hawaiian Minister of the Interior who used the Hawaiian militia as threat against Kalkaua.[25] Kalkaua was forced under threat of assassination[28] to dismiss his cabinet ministers and sign a new constitution which greatly lessened his power.[19] It would become known as the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\" due to the force used.[25]\\r\\nThe Bayonet Constitution allowed the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but had stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature.[27]:152 Eligibility to vote for the House of Nobles was also altered, stipulating that both candidates and voters were now required to own property valuing at least three thousand dollars, or have an annual income of no less than six hundred dollars.[29] This resulted in disenfranchising two thirds of the native Hawaiians as well as other ethnic groups who had previously held the right to vote but were no longer able to meet the new voting requirements.[30] This new constitution benefited the white, foreign plantation owners.[31] With the legislature now responsible for naturalizing citizens, Americans and Europeans could retain their home country citizenship and vote as citizens of the kingdom.[32] Along with voting privileges, Americans could now run for office and still retain their American citizenship, something not afforded in any other nation of the world[33] and even allowed Americans to vote without becoming naturalized.[34] Asian immigrants were completely shut out and were no longer able to acquire citizenship or vote at all.[35]\\r\\nThe Wilcox Rebellion of 1888 was a plot to overthrow King David Kalkaua, king of Hawaii, and replace him with his sister in a coup d'tat in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king after the 1887 constitution. Kalkaua's sister, Princess Lili?uokalani and his wife, Queen Kapiolani, returned from Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee immediately after news reached them in Great Britain.[36]\\r\\nKalkaua's distant cousin, a native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox returned to Hawaii at about the same time as Lili?uokalani[37] in October 1887 when the funding for his study program stopped when the new constitution was signed. Wilcox, Charles B. Wilson, Princess Lili?uokalani, and Sam Nowlein plotted to overthrow King Kalkaua to replace him with his sister, Lili?uokalani. They had 300 Hawaiian conspirators hidden in ?Iolani Barracks and an alliance with the Royal Guard, but the plot was accidentally discovered in January 1888, less than 48 hours before the revolt would have been initiated.[38] No one was prosecuted but Wilcox was exiled. So on February 11, 1888, Wilcox left Hawaii for San Francisco, intending to return to Italy with his wife.\\r\\nPrincess Lili?uokalani was offered the throne several times by the Missionary Party who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on her brother, but she believed she would become a powerless figurehead like her brother and rejected the offers outright.[39]\\r\\nIn November 1889, Kalkaua traveled to San Francisco for his health, staying at the Palace Hotel. He died there on January 20, 1890.[40] His sister Lili?uokalani assumed the throne in the middle of an economic crisis. The McKinley Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian advantage gained via the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875.[41] Many Hawaii businesses and citizens felt pressure from the loss of revenue; in response Lili?uokalani proposed a lottery system to raise money for her government. Also proposed was a controversial opium licensing bill.[42] Her ministers, and closest friends, were all opposed to this plan; they unsuccessfully tried to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis.[43]\\r\\nLili?uokalani's chief desire was to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Bayonet Constitution and promulgating a new one, an idea that seems to have been broadly supported by the Hawaiian population.[44] The 1893 Constitution would have increased suffrage by reducing some property requirements, and eliminated the voting privileges extended to European and American residents. It would have disfranchised many resident European and American businessmen who were not citizens of Hawaii. The Queen toured several of the islands on horseback, talking to the people about her ideas and receiving overwhelming support, including a lengthy petition in support of a new constitution. However, when the Queen informed her cabinet of her plans, they withheld their support due to an understanding of what her opponents' likely response to these plans would be.[45]\\r\\nThough there were threats to Hawaii's sovereignty throughout the Kingdom's history, it was not until the signing of the Bayonet Constitution in 1887 that this threat began to be realized. The precipitating event[46] leading to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893, was the attempt by Queen Lili?uokalani to promulgate a new constitution that would have strengthened the power of the monarch relative to the legislature, where Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power. The stated goals of the conspirators, who were non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects (five American nationals, one English national, and one German national)[47] were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.[48][49]\\r\\nThe overthrow itself was started by newspaper publisher Lorrin Thurston, a Hawaiian subject and former Minister of the Interior who was the grandson of American missionaries,[50] and formally led by the Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Henry E. Cooper, an American lawyer. They derived their support primarily from the American and European business class residing in Hawaii and other supporters of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Most of the leaders of the Committee of Safety that deposed the queen were American and European citizens who were also Kingdom subjects.[51][52][53] They included legislators, government officers, and a Supreme Court Justice of the Hawaiian Kingdom.[54]\\r\\nOn January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom, Charles B. Wilson was tipped off by detectives to the imminent planned overthrow. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member council of the Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied by Attorney General Arthur P. Peterson and the Queens cabinet, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston,[55] Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the Royal Household Guard, Samuel Nowlein, had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Queen.[2]\\r\\nThe events began on January 17, 1893, when John Good, a revolutionist, shot Leialoha, a native policeman who was trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Honolulu Rifles, the paramilitary wing of the Committee of Safety led by Lorrin Thurston.[56] The Committee of Safety feared the shooting would bring government forces to rout out the conspirators and stop the overthrow before it could begin. The Committee of Safety initiated the overthrow by organizing the Honolulu Rifles, consisting of approximately 1,500 armed local (non-native) men, under their leadership, intending to depose Queen Lili?uokalani. The Rifles garrisoned Ali'iolani Hale across the street from ?Iolani Palace and waited for the Queen's response.[49]\\r\\nAs these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu.[57]\\r\\nOn January 17, 1893, the Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Henry E. Cooper, addressed a crowd assembled in front of ?Iolani Palace (the official royal residence) and read aloud a proclamation that formally deposed Queen Lili?uokalani, abolished the Hawaiian monarchy, and established a Provisional Government of Hawaii under President Sanford B. Dole.\\r\\nThe overthrow efforts were supported by United States Government Minister John L. Stevens with an invasion of U.S. Marines, who came ashore at the request of the conspirators.[58] Advised about supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property[59] by the Committee of Safety, Stevens obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the USS Boston and 162 sailors to land on the Kingdom under orders of neutrality and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893.[60]\\r\\nThe overthrow left the queen imprisoned in ?Iolani Palace under house arrest. The American sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, \\"the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.\\"[61] Due to the Queen's desire \\"to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life\\" for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a provisional government.[49]\\r\\nAccording to the Queen's Book, her friend and minister J. S. Walker \\"came and told me that he had come on a painful duty, that the opposition party had requested that I should abdicate.\\" After consulting with her ministers, including Walker, the Queen concluded that \\"since the troops of the United States had been landed to support the revolutionists, by the order of the American minister, it would be impossible for us to make any resistance\\".[62]:387 Despite repeated claims that the overthrow was \\"bloodless\\", the Queen's Book notes that Lili?uokalani received \\"friends [who] expressed their sympathy in person; amongst these Mrs. J. S. Walker, who had lost her husband by the treatment he received from the hands of the insurgents. He was one of many who from persecution had succumbed to death.\\"[62]:296\\r\\nImmediate annexation was prevented by the speech given by President Grover Cleveland to Congress at this time, in which he stated that:\\r\\n... the military demonstration upon the soil of Honolulu was of itself an act of war; unless made either with the consent of the government of Hawaii or for the bona fide purpose of protecting the imperiled lives and property of citizens of the United States. But there is no pretense of any such consent on the part of the government of the queen?... the existing government, instead of requesting the presence of an armed force, protested against it. There is as little basis for the pretense that forces were landed for the security of American life and property. If so, they would have been stationed in the vicinity of such property and so as to protect it, instead of at a distance and so as to command the Hawaiian Government Building and palace?... When these armed men were landed, the city of Honolulu was in its customary orderly and peaceful condition?...[63]\\r\\nThe Republic of Hawaii was nonetheless declared in 1894 by the same parties which had established the provisional government. Among them were Lorrin A. Thurston, a drafter of the Bayonet Constitution, and Sanford Dole who appointed himself President of the forcibly instated Republic on July 4, 1894.\\r\\nA provisional government was set up with the strong support of the Honolulu Rifles, a militia group who had defended the system of government promulgated by the Bayonet Constitution against the Wilcox rebellion of 1889.[49]\\r\\nThe Queen's statement yielding authority, on January 17, 1893, protested the overthrow:\\r\\nI Lili?uokalani, by the Grace of God and under the Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the Constitutional Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom.\\r\\nThat I yield to the superior force of the United States of America whose Minister Plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the Provisional Government.\\r\\nNow to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life, I do this under protest and impelled by said force yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representatives and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the Constitutional Sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.[64]\\r\\nOn December 19, 1898 the queen would amend the declaration with the \\"Memorial of Queen Liliuokalani in relation to the Crown lands of Hawaii\\", further protesting the overthrow and loss of property.[65]\\r\\nNewly inaugurated President Grover Cleveland called for an investigation into the overthrow. This investigation was conducted by former Congressman James Henderson Blount. Blount concluded in his report on July 17, 1893, \\"United States diplomatic and military representatives had abused their authority and were responsible for the change in government.\\"[66] Minister Stevens was recalled, and the military commander of forces in Hawai?i was forced to resign his commission.[citation needed] President Cleveland stated, \\"Substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people requires we should endeavor to repair the monarchy.\\" Cleveland further stated in his 1893 State of the Union Address that, \\"Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our Government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention.\\"[63] The matter was referred by Cleveland to Congress on December 18, 1893, after the Queen refused to accept amnesty for the traitors as a condition of reinstatement. Hawaii President Sanford Dole was presented a demand for reinstatement by Minister Willis, who had not realized Cleveland had already sent the matter to CongressDole flatly refused Cleveland's demands to reinstate the Queen.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator John Tyler Morgan (D-Alabama) and composed mostly of senators in favor of annexation, initiated their own investigation to discredit Blount's earlier report, using pro-annexationist affidavits from Hawaii, and testimony provided to the U.S. Senate in Washington, D.C. Not surprisingly, the Morgan Report contradicted the Blount Report, and exonerated Minister Stevens and the U.S. military troops finding them \\"not guilty\\" of involvement in the overthrow. Cleveland became stalled with his earlier efforts to restore the queen, and adopted a position of recognition of the so-called Provisional Government and the Republic of Hawaii which followed.[67][68]\\r\\nThe Native Hawaiian Study Commission of the United States Congress in its 1983 final report found no historical, legal, or moral obligation for the U.S. government to provide reparations, assistance, or group rights to Native Hawaiians.[69]\\r\\nIn 1993, the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Congress passed a resolution, which President Bill Clinton signed into law, offering an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the United States for its involvement in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This law is known as the Apology Resolution.\\r\\nEvery government with a diplomatic presence in Hawaii, except for the United Kingdom, recognized the Provisional Government within 48 hours of the overthrow via their consulates. Countries recognizing the new Provisional Government included Chile, Austria-Hungary, Mexico, Russia, the Netherlands, Imperial Germany, Sweden, Spain, Imperial Japan,[70] Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Belgium, China, Peru, and France.[71] When the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894, immediate de facto recognition was given by every nation with diplomatic relations with Hawaii, except for Britain, whose response came in November 1894.[72]\\r\\nA four-day uprising between January 6 and 9, 1895, began with an attempted coup d'tat to restore the monarchy, and included battles between Royalists and the republican rebels. Later, after a weapons cache was found on the palace grounds after the attempted rebellion in 1895, Queen Lili?uokalani was placed under arrest, tried by a military tribunal of the Republic of Hawai?i, convicted of misprision of treason and imprisoned in her own home. On January 24, Lili?uokalani abdicated, formally ending the Hawaiian monarchy.[73]\\r\\nThe Committee of Safety declared Sanford Dole to be President of the new Provisional Government of the Kingdom of Hawai?i on January 17, 1893, removing only the Queen, her cabinet, and her marshal from office.[74]:581ÿ587 On July 4, 1894, the Republic of Hawai?i was proclaimed. Dole was president of both governments. As a republic, it was the intention of the government to campaign for annexation with the United States of America. The rationale behind annexation included a strong economic componentHawaiian goods and services exported to the mainland would not be subject to American tariffs, and would benefit from domestic bounties, if Hawaii was part of the United States.[74]:649ÿ650\\r\\nIn 1897, William McKinley succeeded Cleveland as president. A year later he signed the Newlands Resolution, which provided for the annexation of Hawaii on July 7, 1898. The formal ceremony marking the annexation was held at Iolani Palace on August 12, 1898. Almost no Native Hawaiians attended, and those few who were on the streets wore royalist ilima blossoms in their hats or hair, and, on their breasts Hawaiian flags with the motto: Kuu Hae Aloha (\\"my beloved flag\\").[75] Most of the 40,000 Native Hawaiians, including Lili?uokalani and the royal family, shuttered themselves in their homes, protesting what they considered an illegal transaction. \\"When the news of Annexation came it was bitterer than death to me\\", Lili?uokalani's niece, Princess Ka?iulani, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"It was bad enough to lose the throne, but infinitely worse to have the flag go down.\\"[76] The Hawaiian flag was lowered for the last time while the Royal Hawaiian Band played the Hawaiian national anthem, Hawai?i Pono?ؐ.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands, together with the distant Palmyra Island and Stewart Islands, became the Territory of Hawaii, a United States territory, with a new government established on February 22, 1900. Sanford Dole was appointed as the first governor.[77] ?Iolani Palace served as the capitol of the Hawaiian government until 1969.","input":"When were the hawaiian islands annexed by the united states?"},{"output":"Yellow Turban Rebellion","context":"The end of the Han dynasty refers to the period of Chinese history from 189 to 220 AD, which roughly coincides with the tumultuous reign of the Han dynasty's last ruler, Emperor Xian. During this period, the country was thrown into turmoil by the Yellow Turban Rebellion (184-205). Meanwhile, the Han Empire's institutions were destroyed by the warlord Dong Zhuo, and fractured into regional regimes ruled by various warlords, some of whom were nobles and officials of the Han imperial court. Eventually, one of those warlords, Cao Cao, was able to gradually reunify the empire, ostensibly under Emperor Xian's rule, but the empire was actually controlled by Cao Cao himself. Cao Cao's efforts to completely reunite the Han empire were rebuffed at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 / 209, when his armies were defeated by the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The Han dynasty formally ended in 220 when Cao Cao's son and heir, Cao Pi, pressured Emperor Xian into abdicating in his favour. Cao Pi became the emperor of a new state, Cao Wei. A year later, in response to Cao Pi's usurpation of the Han throne, Liu Bei declared himself emperor of Shu Han; and in 229, Sun Quan followed suit, declaring himself emperor of Eastern Wu. The period from Emperor Xian's abdication in 220 to the partial reunification of China under the Jin dynasty in 265 was known as the Three Kingdoms era in Chinese history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the reign of Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168ÿ189), many officials in the imperial court foresaw chaos in the political scene as soon as Emperor Ling died. One of those officials, Liu Yan, suggested to Emperor Ling in 188 that the root of the agrarian revolts during that time, including the most serious Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184, was that Inspectors (}) lacked substantial administrative powers. Emperor Ling, convinced by Liu Yan, changed the Inspectors' titles to \\"Governor\\" () and granted them the authority to levy taxes and command armed forces within the borders. Liu Yan was commissioned as the Governor of Yi Province (y; covering the Sichuan Basin), while several other important officials also became Governors, including Liu Yu, who was appointed Governor of You Province (L; covering present-day northern Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin and Liaoning). The increased influence of these provincial governors formed the basis on which later warlords would control large regions of the Han empire.\\r\\nEmperor Ling died in 189 and was succeeded by his 13-year-old son, Liu Bian (born to Empress He), who became known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, now empress dowager, became regent to the young emperor, while her older brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, became the most powerful official in the imperial court. He Jin and Yuan Shao plotted to exterminate all the Ten Attendants, a group of ten influential eunuch officials in the court, but Empress Dowager He disapproved of their plan. In a fateful move, He Jin summoned Dong Zhuo, a warlord controlling the battle-tested Liang Province (??; covering present-day Gansu), to march on the capital Luoyang to threaten Empress Dowager He into eliminating the Ten Attendants. After the eunuchs discovered He Jin's plot, they lured him into the palace and murdered him. In response, Yuan Shao led the imperial guards on an indiscriminate massacre of the palace eunuchs. The surviving eunuchs kidnapped Emperor Shao and his younger brother, the eight-year-old Prince of Chenliu (raised by his grandmother Empress Dowager Dong), and fled north towards the Yellow River, but were finally forced to commit suicide by throwing themselves into the river.\\r\\nDong Zhuo arrived on the scene and found Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu. The young emperor appeared nervous and fearful, while the prince remained calm and composed, and gave orders to Dong Zhuo to escort them back to the palace. Dong Zhuo used the opportunity to seize control of state power and bring his army into the capital. Not long later, Dong Zhuo deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu, who became known as Emperor Xian. Dong Zhuo dominated the imperial court and named himself \\"Chancellor of State\\" (??), a title not held by anyone since the Western Han dynasty statesman Xiao He; Dong Zhuo also granted himself the privilege of attending court without needing to disarm himself or remove his shoes.\\r\\nIn the spring of 190, several provincial officials and warlords formed a coalition against Dong Zhuo, claiming that he was set on usurping the throne and had effectively kidnapped Emperor Xian. Yuan Shao, Administrator of Bohai (; covering present-day Cangzhou, Hebei), was nominated to be the leader of the coalition. The coalition armies was stationed at Henei (T??; in present-day Jiaozuo, Henan) and appeared to be ready to move on the capital Luoyang. However, the coalition was actually rather disorganized, and Yuan Shao did not have effective command over the entire alliance. Besides, the coalition members were also hesitant to directly confront Dong Zhuo and his strong Liang Province military. Still, Dong Zhuo was anxious and chose to move the capital to Chang'an in the west to avoid the coalition. About a month later, Dong Zhuo forced Emperor Xian and the imperial court to move to Chang'an, along with Luoyang's residents, and in the process, he ordered the former capital to be destroyed by fire. During the move, Dong Zhuo remained near Luoyang, ready to resist any coalition attacks on him. In 191, the coalition tried to further de-legitimize Dong Zhuo's position by offering to enthrone Liu Yu, who was eligible to be Emperor since he was a member of the royal clan. Liu Yu remained faithful to Emperor Xian and firmly declined to take the throne. As the coalition members continued to bicker over battle plans, a minor general under Yuan Shu, Sun Jian, took a calculated risk and attacked Dong Zhuo directly near Luoyang. After scoring a number of victories over Dong Zhuo's forces, Sun Jian eventually forced Dong to retreat to Chang'an, and Luoyang came under the coalition's control.\\r\\nFor the following months until the end of 191, the coalition ceased to take further action against Dong Zhuo, and eventually disbanded and the members returned to their respective bases. Soon, a number of officials started having thoughts of controlling and ruling over their own territories like kings. The most prominent warlords who emerged at that time included:\\r\\nHowever, in addition to these greater warlords, in time the entire Han empire virtually fractured into small blocs, each controlled by a local warlord.\\r\\nAfter Dong Zhuo withdrew to Chang'an, he maintained an even tighter grip on the government and cruelly dealt with all dissent against him. Interior Minister Wang Yun and a few other officials, including Huang Wan (?Sq), Shisun Rui (?O??), and Yang Zan (?b?), plotted to eliminate Dong Zhuo. They eventually persuaded Dong Zhuo's foster son, L Bu, to join them. L Bu bore a grudge against Dong Zhuo because the latter almost killed him once during a fit of anger, and also because he was afraid that his secret affair with one of Dong Zhuo's maids might be exposed. In May 192, the conspirators, led by L Bu and Wang Yun, assassinated Dong Zhuo and slaughtered his clan.\\r\\nAfter Dong Zhuo's death, it was believed that the chaos caused by Dong Zhuo's \\"reign of terror\\" would subside, and the central government would be restored to its original state. However, although Wang Yun was regarded as a capable minister, he gradually became arrogant and made several key mistakes that would cause his downfall. He failed to maintain good relations with L Bu, and strongly refused to grant amnesty to the surviving followers of Dong Zhuo and ordered them to be disbanded. This caused Dong Zhuo's men to fear that they might be massacred. Dong Zhuo's son-in-law, Niu Fu, took control of Dong's forces in Liang Province and resisted Wang Yun, but later died in a friendly fire incident. Niu Fu's subordinates, Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou, wanted to submit to the imperial court, but as they had previously resisted Wang Yun, Wang now rejected their request for amnesty. Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou led their armies to attack Chang'an and took control of the government. Wang Yun was captured and executed along with his family, while L Bu was defeated and driven away.\\r\\nAfter taking control over the imperial court in Chang'an, Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou did as they pleased without showing any regard for the welfare of the state. Concurrently, provincial warlords all over China battled each other to expand their territories or further their personal interests. Some of those warlords were friendly with Li Jue's forces, while others remained hostile to them, even though all of them nominally acknowledged Emperor Xian as the sovereign ruler of China.\\r\\nIn 193, armed conflict broke out between the northern warlords Liu Yu and Gongsun Zan. Liu Yu strongly opposed warfare while Gongsun Zan continuously waged war against Yuan Shao. Liu Yu and Gongsun Zan made accusations against each other in their respective memorials to Emperor Xian. Eventually, Liu Yu was unable to tolerate Gongsun Zan and attacked the latter, but was defeated and killed.\\r\\nIn 195, turmoil ensued in Chang'an when Li Jue and Guo Si killed Fan Chou together, and later turned against each other. Li Jue held Emperor Xian hostage while Guo Si kidnapped the imperial officials, and both sides engaged in battle. Later that year, Li Jue and Guo Si made peace and agreed to allow Emperor Xian to return to the old capital, Luoyang, but later regretted their decision and pursued him. While Li Jue and Guo Si were never able to capture Emperor Xian again, the imperial court was rendered poor and unable to fend for itself. As Luoyang had been previously devastated by fire during Dong Zhuo's time, the city lacked the basic essentials of life and many officials starved to death or resorted to cannibalism. Around this time, Ju Shou suggested to Yuan Shao to welcome Emperor Xian to his province so that he could take effective control of the government. However, Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong opposed Ju Shou's view, claiming that if Yuan Shao brought Emperor Xian to his territory, he would need to yield to the emperor on key decisions and follow proper court protocol. Yuan Shao remained hesitant and did not come to a conclusion on whether to receive the emperor or not.\\r\\nWhile Yuan Shao was still indecisive on whether to welcome Emperor Xian or not, Cao Cao took advantage of the situation to bring the emperor to his territory. At that time, Cao Cao was still a relatively minor warlord, with only Yan Province (??; covering present-day western Shandong and eastern Henan) under his control. In 196, Cao Cao led his army towards Luoyang. He encountered Dong Cheng and Yang Feng (who were shielding Emperor Xian from Li Jue and Guo Si), convinced them of his loyalty, and was allowed to meet the emperor. In name, Cao Cao was sharing power with the other officials and nobles, but actually he was in control, but yet he ensured that the officials and nobles were treated with due respect, hence he faced minimal opposition in the imperial court. Later, Cao Cao escorted the emperor back to his base in Xu (; present-day Xuchang, Henan), establishing the new capital there.\\r\\nFrom then on, although Cao Cao was a subject of Emperor Xian in name, he actually wielded state power and controlled the imperial court. Despite so, Cao Cao never showed disrespect to Emperor Xian, and instead, honoured the emperor according to formal imperial protocol. Cao Cao also issued imperial edicts in Emperor Xian's name to other warlords, ordering them to submit to imperial authority when in fact they were actually submitting to him. When Cao Cao sent Yuan Shao an edict in the emperor's name, only then did Yuan realize that he had lost an opportunity to make use of the emperor to control other warlords.\\r\\nEven after moving to the new capital at Xu, the central government still lacked funds and food supplies. As suggested by Zao Zhi (??l), Cao Cao implemented a new tuntian policy to promote agricultural production, in which soldiers were sent to grow crops, and the harvest would be shared between the military and civilian population. The policy yielded commendable results as the area around Xu developed into highly productive farmland and the problem of shortage of food was resolved.\\r\\nAt this time, the most prominent warlords in China were:\\r\\nThere were still many other minor warlords, and Cao Cao particularly sought to get them to submit to him. In 197, Zhang Xiu surrendered Wancheng to Cao Cao. However, Cao Cao later had an affair with Zhang Xiu's widowed aunt, angering Zhang, who rebelled and launched a surprise attack on Cao Cao at Wancheng. In this battle, Cao Cao's oldest son Cao Ang, nephew Cao Anmin, and bodyguard Dian Wei were killed, and Cao Cao himself narrowly escaped from death. On the advice of Jia Xu, Zhang Xiu eventually surrendered to Cao Cao in 200. In addition, in 197, Cao Cao was able to persuade Ma Teng and Han Sui, who controlled Yong and Liang provinces (covering most of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu), to submit to him.\\r\\nThat year, Yuan Shu declared himself \\"Son of Heaven\\" in Shouchun (?y?; present-day Shou County, Anhui), an act perceived as treason against the Han dynasty government, prompting other warlords to use that as an excuse to attack him (see Campaign against Yuan Shu). Sun Ce, son of Sun Jian, who had conquered several territories in Jiangdong between 194 and 199, ended his alliance with Yuan Shu and became an independent warlord. L Bu, who was also previously Yuan Shu's ally, broke ties with Yuan and dealt him a major defeat near Shouchun. Cao Cao also attacked Yuan Shu and defeated him. Yuan Shu attempted to flee north to join Yuan Shao but his way was blocked and he would die of illness on his return to Shouchun in 199.\\r\\nIn 198, Yuan Shao tried to persuade Cao Cao to move the capital to Juancheng (̓; in present-day Heze, Shandong), which was nearer to his own territory, in an attempt to wrestle Emperor Xian away from Cao, but Cao refused. Later that year, Cao Cao joined forces with Liu Bei to attack L Bu, defeating him at the Battle of Xiapi. L Bu was captured and executed on Cao Cao's order, and Xu Province came under Cao's control.\\r\\nIn 199, Gongsun Zan was defeated by Yuan Shao at the Battle of Yijing and he committed suicide by setting himself on fire. Gongsun Zan's territories, which extended to the northern boundaries of the Han dynasty's empire, were completely annexed by Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao then turned his attention south towards Cao Cao, who was an emerging power in central China. Yuan formed an alliance with Liu Biao and was intent on attacking Cao Cao.\\r\\nAgainst the advice of Ju Shou and Tian Feng, who reasoned that their troops were exhausted after the battles against Gongsun Zan and needed rest, Yuan Shao prepared for a campaign against Cao Cao, confident that his much larger army could easily crush Cao Cao's. While Cao Cao readied himself for battle, he discovered that Dong Cheng, Liu Bei and a few other officials were conspiring against him. In early 200, Liu Bei used an opportunity to break away from Cao Cao and seize control of Xu Province, after killing Cao Cao's appointed governor of the province, Che Zhou (???). On the other hand, Dong Cheng and the others were making plans to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was exposed and all the conspirators in the capital were massacred along with their families. Cao Cao then took a risk by attacking Liu Bei in Xu Province, leaving his flank open to attacks from Yuan Shao. However, Cao Cao made a right choice because Yuan Shao did not heed Tian Feng's urging to seize the chance to attack him. Liu Bei was defeated and he fled north to join Yuan Shao. Liu Bei's general Guan Yu surrendered to Cao Cao and temporarily served under Cao.\\r\\nOnly after Liu Bei's defeat did Yuan Shao start implementing his plan to attack Cao Cao, but this time Tian Feng opposed his decision, saying that their opportunity had passed. Yuan Shao became annoyed with Tian Feng and had Tian imprisoned, after which he led his army south to attack Cao Cao. At the Battle of Boma, Yuan Shao's general Yan Liang was slain by Guan Yu while another of Yuan's generals, Wen Chou, was killed in action against Cao Cao's forces. The morale of Yuan Shao's army was greatly affected by the loss of the two generals.\\r\\nBy late 200, the armies of Yuan Shao and Cao Cao finally clashed at Guandu (ⷃA; in present-day Zhengzhou, Henan), south of the Yellow River. Yuan Shao had two advantages over Cao Cao - numerical superiority and greater amount of supplies, but Cao Cao's troops were better trained than his. After some minor skirmishes, both sides became locked in a stalemate, until Cao Cao personally led a small detachment on a surprise attack on Yuan Shao's supply depot at Wuchao, which was defended by Chunyu Qiong. Instead of sending reinforcements to Wuchao, Yuan Shao sent Zhang He and Gao Lan (ԃC) to attack Cao Cao's camp, but was unsuccessful. The fall of Wuchao dealt a major blow to the morale of Yuan Shao's army, which was subsequently routed by Cao Cao's forces. Yuan Shao fled north of the Yellow River while most of his troops were either killed or surrendered to Cao Cao. From that point on, although Yuan Shao continued to remain as a major power player, he could no longer challenge Cao Cao's growing supremacy.\\r\\nAfter Yuan Shao died of illness in 202, a struggle of succession developed between his oldest son Yuan Tan and third son Yuan Shang. Several years before Yuan Shao's death, based on the traditional order of succession, Yuan Tan should have been designated as the heir apparent, but as Yuan Shao's wife Lady Liu favoured Yuan Shang, so Yuan Shao had Yuan Tan posthumously adopted by the latter's uncle, Yuan Cheng (). Yuan Shao then divided his territories between his sons and nephew Gao Gan, ostensibly so that he could determine their abilities. His base of Ji Province was given to Yuan Shang, Yuan Tan controlled Qing Province, while Yuan Xi governed You Province, and Gao Gan ruled Bing Province. On his deathbed, Yuan Shao did not leave any explicit instruction as to who should succeed him. Of Yuan Shao's followers, Pang Ji and Shen Pei supported Yuan Shang, while Xin Ping and Guo Tu favoured Yuan Tan. After Yuan Shao's death, most of his subordinates initially wanted Yuan Tan to be their new lord, since he was the oldest son. However, Shen Pei and Pang Ji forged a will, naming Yuan Shang as the successor. Yuan Tan was furious and mobilized his forces under the pretext of attacking Cao Cao, drawing Cao's attention, and Cao preemptively retaliated. Yuan Shang came to his oldest brother's aid, and they fought inconclusively against Cao Cao in the Battle of Liyang.\\r\\nIn 203, Cao Cao scored a major victory over the Yuans, who retreated back to Ji Province's capital, Ye (?). Cao Cao then planned to besiege Ye, but later withdrew his forces after heeding Guo Jia's advice. Guo Jia reasoned that if Cao Cao pressured the Yuans, they might unite against a common enemy; however, if Cao Cao retreated, the disgruntled Yuan brothers would start fighting among themselves. Guo Jia's prediction came true later when Yuan Tan, still bearing a grudge against Yuan Shang for receiving a larger inheritance, attacked Yuan Shang, but his forces in Qing Province defected to Yuan Shang. Yuan Tan fled to Pingyuan (; in present-day Dezhou, Shandong) and was besieged by Yuan Shang there. Yuan Tan sought help from Cao Cao, and Cao advanced north to attack Ye, forcing Yuan Shang to lift the siege on Pingyuan. In early 204, Yuan Shang incorrectly believed that Cao Cao had withdrawn, so he attacked his brother again at Pingyuan. Cao Cao attacked Ye once more and Yuan Shang headed back to defend his base, but was defeated by Cao Cao. Yuan Shang then fled north to Zhongshan (\\\\; in present-day Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Ye fell to Cao Cao. Gao Gan also surrendered Bing Province to Cao Cao.\\r\\nDuring Cao Cao's siege on Ye, Yuan Tan did not help attack Ye but sought to take Yuan Shang's territories, defeating Yuan Shang in Zhongshan. Yuan Shang fled further north to join Yuan Xi in You Province. Cao Cao now accused Yuan Tan of breaching the trust in the alliance so he turned east to attack him, capturing Yuan Tan's last stronghold at Nanpi (q; in present-day Cangzhou, Hebei) and killing Yuan. Meanwhile, in You Province, Yuan Xi's subordinate Jiao Chu (Ƙ) revolted and surrendered to Cao Cao, forcing Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang to flee further north to join the Wuhuan tribes under chief Tadun. Around this time, Gao Gan also rebelled against Cao Cao, but was defeated by 206 and killed while attempting to flee south to join Liu Biao.\\r\\nIn 207, Cao Cao's army headed north to attack the Wuhuan, defeating them at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Tadun was killed in battle while Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang sought refuge under Gongsun Kang, a warlord who controlled most of present-day Liaoning. Gongsun Kang feared that the Yuans might turn against him and seize his territory, so he had them executed and sent their heads to Cao Cao. By this time, the Yuan clan had been completely eliminated and much of northern China had been reunified under Cao Cao's control.\\r\\nIn the years after his reunification of northern China, Cao Cao did not conduct any major campaigns while awaiting an opportunity to act against the remaining three most prominent warlords: Sun Quan, who had succeeded his older brother Sun Ce after the latter was assassinated in 200; Liu Biao; Liu Zhang. During that time, Sun Quan was also developing his territories in Jiangdong, which he inherited from Sun Ce, and strengthening his military forces. In 208, Sun Quan defeated and killed Liu Biao's vassal Huang Zu at the Battle of Xiakou, seizing most of Huang's territory at Jiangxia (ߪG; present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei).\\r\\nWhile Cao Cao was attacking the Yuan clan in northern China, Liu Bei fled south to join Liu Biao and became a vassal under the latter. In 208, Cao Cao launched a southern campaign to conquer Liu Biao's Jing Province. Liu Biao was ill and dying, when a succession struggle broke out between his sons Liu Qi and Liu Cong. After Huang Zu's defeat, Liu Qi was appointed by Liu Biao as Administrator of Jiangxia, which was previously governed by Huang. Liu Cong, who was favoured by Liu Biao's second wife Lady Cai (because he married her niece), remained in Jing Province's capital, Xiangyang. Liu Cong became the new Governor of Jing Province after his father's death. Fearing that he might be caught in a war on two fronts (Cao Cao in the north and Liu Qi in the southeast), Liu Cong surrendered to Cao Cao, and most of Jing Province came under Cao Cao's control. Liu Bei was unwilling to submit to Cao Cao and fled south. Along the way, one of Cao Cao's light cavalry units caught up with Liu Bei's retreating forces (which included civilians) and defeated them at the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei escaped with his life and fled to Dangyang (??; in present-day Yichang, Hubei).\\r\\nIn Jiangdong, Sun Quan felt threatened by Cao Cao's approaching army and sent Lu Su to discuss forming an alliance with Liu Bei and Liu Qi against Cao Cao. Cao Cao wrote Sun Quan a letter, intended to intimidate the latter into submitting. Cao Cao's army was estimated to be 220,000 men strong, although Cao himself claimed that he had 800,000 troops. Sun Quan had 30,000 men at most while Liu Bei and Liu Qi's combined forces totaled about 10,000. In view of Cao Cao's overwhelming forces, many of Sun Quan's followers, including Zhang Zhao, strongly advocated surrender. However, Sun Quan refused as he agreed with Zhou Yu and Lu Su's view that Cao Cao might not let him off even if he submitted. By late 208, with help from Zhou Yu and Lu Su (and Zhuge Liang, who represented Liu Bei in the diplomatic exchange), an alliance was formed between Sun Quan and Liu Bei against Cao Cao.\\r\\nSun Quan put Zhou Yu in command of his 30,000 troops, largely stationed on naval vessels. Zhou Yu set up a defensive position in conjunction with Liu Bei, whose army garrisoned on land. Around this time, a spreading plague significantly weakened Cao Cao's forces. Zhou Yu's subordinate Huang Gai pretended to defect to Cao Cao's side and was accepted by the latter. Huang Gai brought with him a small group of men and they sailed towards Cao Cao's base on boats. As the boats approached Cao Cao's fleet, Huang Gai ordered his men to set the boats on fire, and the burning boats crashed into Cao Cao's larger ships. The fire spread out of control and completely destroyed Cao Cao's entire naval fleet. Cao Cao's land forces at Wulin (??; in present-day Honghu, Hubei) were also attacked and driven back by Sun Quan and Liu Bei's armies. Cao Cao suffered a drastic defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs and was forced to retreat north back to Jiangling (@, located in present-day Jingjiang , not to be confused with present-day Jiangling County, Hubei).\\r\\nImmediately after the Battle of Red Cliffs, Sun Quan's forces under Zhou Yu's command pressed on another attack on Cao Cao, leading to the Battle of Jiangling. On the other hand, Liu Bei used the opportunity to attack the four commanderies of Wuling, Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang in southern Jing Province and bring them under his control. By early 209, Cao Cao had lost most of Jing Province to the allies.\\r\\nAs Liu Bei had become relatively more powerful after his conquests of the four commanderies, Sun Quan became apprehensive of him and decided to strengthen their alliance by arranging for a marriage between his younger sister, Lady Sun, and Liu Bei. Zhou Yu was suspicious of Liu Bei's intentions and suggested to Sun Quan to capture Liu Bei, put him under house arrest, and then take control over Liu's forces. However, Sun Quan rejected Zhou Yu's idea as he believed that Liu Bei's forces would rebel against him even if the plan succeeded. Sun Quan did agree with Zhou Yu's suggestion to consider attacking the warlords Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu, who controlled parts of western China, including present-day southern Shaanxi and the Sichuan Basin. The plan was not set into motion and eventually aborted when Zhou Yu died in 210. Even though Sun Quan did not expand his borders west, he managed to persuade several local leaders in present-day Guangdong, Guangxi and northern Vietnam to submit to him, and these territories became part of his domain. Sun Quan then agreed to \\"lend\\" northern Jing Province to Liu Bei as well when the latter complained that the south lacked resources to sustain his military.\\r\\nCao Cao, after resting his forces for several years in light of his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, made a major advance again in 211, this time to ostensibly to attack Zhang Lu of Hanzhong. Warlords Han Sui and Ma Chao, who controlled Liang and Yong provinces, suspected that Cao Cao had designs on them and launched attacks in retaliation. A coalition of forces from west of Hangu Pass, led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, were defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of Tong Pass in 211, and their territories were annexed by Cao over the next few years.\\r\\nLiu Zhang of Yi Province became worried of possible attacks from Zhang Lu and Cao Cao, so he sent Fa Zheng to invite Liu Bei into his domain to help him defend against Zhang Lu and Cao Cao. Fa Zheng was unimpressed with Liu Zhang's governorship and wanted Liu Bei to replace his lord, so he urged Liu Bei to use the opportunity to take control of Yi Province. Liu Bei heeded Fa Zheng's suggestion and led his army into Yi Province, where he received a warm welcome from Liu Zhang. Liu Zhang sent Liu Bei to station at Jiameng Pass in northern Yi Province to resist Zhang Lu.\\r\\nIn 212, Liu Bei and Liu Zhang turned hostile towards each other and waged war. Zhuge Liang led a detachment of Liu Bei's forces left in Jing Province to join his lord in attacking Liu Zhang. Guan Yu remained behind to defend Jing Province. In 215, Liu Bei had defeated much of Liu Zhang's forces and besieged him in his capital of Chengdu. Liu Zhang surrendered and yielded Yi Province to Liu Bei. The province became Liu Bei's new base, and he used the mountainous surroundings as natural defenses against Cao Cao in the north.\\r\\nIn the same year Liu Bei took over Yi Province, diplomatic relations between him and Sun Quan deteriorated when he refused to return Jing Province, which he \\"borrowed\\" from Sun Quan five years ago. Sun Quan launched an initial attack on Guan Yu and much of eastern Jing Province quickly submitted. However, after negotiations between Guan Yu and Lu Su, Liu Bei agreed to give up the three commanderies of Changsha, Jiangxia and Guiyang to Sun Quan, renewing their alliance and dividing Jing Province between them along the Xiang River.\\r\\nIn 215, Cao Cao attacked Zhang Lu and defeated him at the Battle of Yangping. Zhang Lu surrendered and his domain in Hanzhong came under Cao Cao's control. Against the advice of his followers to move south and attack Liu Bei in Yi Province, Cao Cao withdrew his armies and left Xiahou Yuan in command of a small force to defend Hanzhong. The following year, Cao Cao pressured Emperor Xian into granting him a title of nobility, \\"King of Wei\\". Over the next few years, Cao Cao's style of living became more like the emperor's, and he also received greater honours.\\r\\nIn 217, Liu Bei started a campaign to seize Hanzhong from Cao Cao. After Xiahou Yuan was defeated and killed at the Battle of Mount Dingjun in 219, Cao Cao became alarmed and quickly arrived with reinforcements to resist Liu Bei. Both sides became locked in a stalemate, except for a clash at the Battle of Han River, before Cao Cao eventually decided to withdraw his forces, giving up Hanzhong to Liu Bei. Liu Bei subsequently declared himself \\"King of Hanzhong\\" after his victory.\\r\\nAround the time when Liu Bei was attacking Hanzhong, Guan Yu also advanced north from Jing Province to attack Cao Cao's city of Fancheng (܂; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was defended by Cao Ren. While Cao Ren managed to hold on to his position firmly, Guan Yu besieged the city, and the situation was serious enough that Cao Cao even considered moving the capital away from Xu.\\r\\nAt the same time, Sun Quan became increasingly resentful of Guan Yu because the latter had previously shown hostility towards him in three incidents: Guan Yu drove away the officials Sun Quan sent to the three commanderies that Liu Bei had promised to give up to Sun; Guan Yu forcefully seized food supplies from one of Sun Quan's bases for use in his Fancheng campaign; Guan Yu ridiculed Sun Quan when the latter proposed a marriage between his son and Guan's daughter. When Guan Yu was away attacking Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general L Meng to launch an assault on Jing Province from the east, swiftly conquering the province within weeks. The morale of Guan Yu's forces fell sharply and his soldiers gradually deserted him until he was left with only about 300 men. Guan Yu was isolated and besieged by Sun Quan's forces in Maicheng, and he attempted to break out but fell into an ambush and was captured. Guan Yu refused to surrender and was eventually executed on Sun Quan's order. This marked the end of the alliance between Sun Quan and Liu Bei. Sun Quan nominally submitted to Cao Cao and was granted the title of \\"Marquis of Wu\\". Sun Quan also urged Cao Cao to take the emperor's throne but Cao declined.\\r\\nCao Cao died in March 220 and his son Cao Pi inherited the title of \\"King of Wei\\" without waiting for formal authorization from Emperor Xian. In the winter of 220, Emperor Xian sent the Imperial Seal to Cao Pi and issued an edict announcing that he was abdicating in favour of Cao Pi. Cao Pi formally declined to accept the throne thrice but obliged eventually. The Han dynasty officially ended at that point and Cao Pi established the state of Cao Wei in its place, moving the capital from Xu back to Luoyang. The dethroned Emperor Xian was granted a title of \\"Duke of Shanyang\\".\\r\\nIn 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor in Chengdu and established the state of Shu Han. Sun Quan continued to remain as a nominal subject of Cao Pi until 222, when he declared himself king of a separate state, Wu (better known as Eastern Wu in history). In 229, Sun Quan formally became emperor of Wu.","input":"What caused the collapse of the han dynasty?"},{"output":"Stephen Curry","context":"The highest-paid NBA players by season over the past twelve seasons have received contracts with salaries noted in the twenty-million-dollar range. In this twelve-year span, Kevin Garnett received $28,000,000, which was the highest salary payment of any NBA player, during the 2003ÿ04 season. Garnett has been the highest-paid NBA player per year in seven of the past twelve NBA seasons. Michael Jordan was the first NBA player to sign a contract worth over thirty million dollars in a season. During the 1997ÿ98 season, Jordan earned $33,000,000. Kobe Bryant become just the second player to reach this milestone when the 2013ÿ14 season began.[1] LeBron James became the third in the 2016ÿ17 season. Stephen Curry became the first player to eclipse $40-Million per year when he signed a record 5-year contract worth $201-Million in 2017.\\r\\nBeginning in the 1984ÿ85 NBA season, the NBA's first salary cap was introduced. The NBA salary cap is the maximum dollar amount each NBA team can spend on its players for the season. However, the NBA uses a \\"soft\\" salary cap, which means that significant \\"salary exceptions\\" allow NBA teams to exceed their allotted amount in order to sign players. The salary cap is determined during the offseason, but as stated earlier, it is liable to change.[2]\\r\\nAn exception is necessary to sign a player for a contract that would exceed the salary cap threshold of the \\"soft cap\\". The Larry Bird exception, more commonly known as Bird Rights, allows teams to re-sign a current player only if he has played for that particular team for a minimum of three years.[3] Another exception known as the mid-level exception allows for teams that are over the salary cap to sign one or more players as long as they do not exceed the total amount of the average NBA salary.[4] Next, the bi-annual exception can be used by teams every other year to sign a free agent(s) for up to two years at an amount set by the NBA.[5] Finally, the rookie player exception allows any NBA team to sign their first-round draft pick to a contract based upon a scale previously set forth by the NBA. Another option for teams would be to assign players to a league-assigned minimum salary contract for a maximum of two years.\\r\\nAccording to 2010ÿ11 NBA season game performance, the league's best players were not its highest-paid players. Each year there are ten players selected to one of the two All-NBA Teams.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan, New York City, and is subject to extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. The UN is the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world.[3]\\r\\nThe UN Charter was drafted at a conference between AprilÿJune 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the conclusion of the conference;[4][5] this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.\\r\\nThe UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC; for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the UN Trusteeship Council (inactive since 1994). UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The UN's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General, an office held by Portuguese Ant܇nio Guterres since 2017. Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work.\\r\\nThe organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize. Other evaluations of the UN's effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called the organization ineffective, corrupt, or biased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.[6] Following the catastrophic loss of life in the First World War, the Paris Peace Conference established the League of Nations to maintain harmony between countries.[7] This organization resolved some territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such as postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be absorbed into the UN.[8] However, the League lacked representation for colonial peoples (then half the world's population) and significant participation from several major powers, including the US, USSR, Germany, and Japan; it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, and German expansions under Adolf Hitler that culminated in the Second World War.[9]\\r\\nThe earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the US State Department in 1939.[10] The text of the \\"Declaration by United Nations\\" was drafted by President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, while meeting at the White House, 29 December 1941. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France. \\"Four Policemen\\" was coined to refer to four major Allied countries, United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China, which emerged in the Declaration by United Nations.[11] Roosevelt first coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries.[b] \\"On New Year's Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, Maxim Litvinov, of the USSR, and T. V. Soong, of China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures.\\"[12] The term United Nations was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.[13][14] By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed.[15]\\r\\nA JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, COSTA RICA, CUBA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDURAS, INDIA, LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PANAMA, POLAND, SOUTH AFRICA, YUGOSLAVIA\\r\\nThe Governments signatory hereto,\\r\\nHaving subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated August 14, 1941, known as the Atlantic Charter,\\r\\nBeing convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world,\\r\\nDECLARE:\\r\\nThe foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.\\r\\nDuring the war, \\"the United Nations\\" became the official term for the Allies. To join, countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis.[16]\\r\\nThe UN was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the Allied Big Four (the Soviet Union, the UK, the US, and China) at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944.[17][18] After months of planning, the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco, 25 April 1945, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the UN Charter.[4][5][19]\\"The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings: Anthony Eden, of Britain, Edward Stettinius, of the United States, T. V. Soong, of China, and Vyacheslav Molotov, of the Soviet Union. At the later meetings, Lord Halifax deputized for Mr. Eden, Wellington Koo for T. V. Soong, and Mr Gromyko for Mr. Molotov.\\"[20] The UN officially came into existence 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security CouncilFrance, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the UK and the USand by a majority of the other 46 signatories.[21]\\r\\nThe first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented,[c] and the Security Council took place in London beginning 10 January 1946.[21] The General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters of the UN, and the facility was completed in 1952. Its sitelike UN headquarters buildings in Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobiis designated as international territory.[24] The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Trygve Lie, was elected as the first UN Secretary-General.[21]\\r\\nThough the UN's primary mandate was peacekeeping, the division between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War.[25] (A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed in the absence of the USSR.)[21][26] In 1947, the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine, approving the creation of the state of Israel. Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict.[27] In 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis;[28] however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country's revolution.[29]\\r\\nIn 1960, the UN deployed United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to bring order to the breakaway State of Katanga, restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964.[30] While travelling to meet with rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict, Dag Hammarskj?ld, often named as one of the UN's most effective Secretaries-General,[31] died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[32] In 1964, Hammarskj?ld's successor, U Thant, deployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.[33]\\r\\nWith the spread of decolonization in the 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa.[28] On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but with the support of many Third World nations, the mainland, communist People's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization.[34] Third World nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN.[35] In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991, shortly after the end of the Cold War.[36]\\r\\nWith an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange.[37] By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.\\r\\nAfter the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades.[38] Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold.[39][40][41] The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War, launched a successful peacekeeping mission in Namibia, and oversaw democratic elections in post-apartheid South Africa and post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia.[42] In 1991, the UN authorized a US-led coalition that repulsed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.[43] Brian Urquhart, Under-Secretary-General from 1971 to 1985, later described the hopes raised by these successes as a \\"false renaissance\\" for the organization, given the more troubled missions that followed.[44]\\r\\nThough the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of simultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia.[45] The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu, and the UN mission to Bosnia faced \\"worldwide ridicule\\" for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing.[46] In 1994, the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan genocide amid indecision in the Security Council.[47]\\r\\nBeginning in the last decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption.[48] In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore.[49][50] Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing the size of the organization somewhat.[51][52] His successor, Kofi Annan (1997ÿ2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.[52]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms. The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991ÿ2002 was supplemented by British Royal Marines, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by NATO.[53]In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization's effectiveness.[54] Under the eighth Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War.[55] In 2013, an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered \\"systemic failure\\".[56] One hundred and one UN personnel died in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the worst loss of life in the organization's history.[57]\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit was held in 2000 to discuss the UN's role in the 21st century.[58] The three day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history, and culminated in the adoption by all member states of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as poverty reduction, gender equality, and public health. Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed the UN's focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global security.[59] The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.[60]\\r\\nIn addition to addressing global challenges, the UN has sought to improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency.[61] In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General.[62] On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat Ant܇nio Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs.[63]\\r\\nThe UN system is based on five principal organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice.[64] A sixth principal organ, the Trusteeship Council, suspended operations in 1994, upon the independence of Palau, the last remaining UN trustee territory.[65]\\r\\nFour of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City.[66] The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva,[67] Vienna,[68] and Nairobi.[69] Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six official languages of the UN, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.[70] On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.[71]\\r\\nBelow the six organs sit, in the words of the author Linda Fasulo, \\"an amazing collection of entities and organizations, some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it\\".[72] These include specialized agencies, research and training institutions, programmes and funds, and other UN entities.[73]\\r\\nThe UN obey the Noblemaire principle, which is binding on any organization that belongs to the UN system. This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest, and also calls for equal pay for work of equal value independent of the employee's nationality.[74][75] Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations.[74][76]\\r\\nThe General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the UN. Composed of all UN member states, the assembly meets in regular yearly sessions, but emergency sessions can also be called.[78] The assembly is led by a president, elected from among the member states on a rotating regional basis, and 21 vice-presidents.[79] The first session convened 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in London and included representatives of 51 nations.[21]\\r\\nWhen the General Assembly votes on important questions, a two-thirds majority of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters.[80] All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.[78]\\r\\nDraft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by eight committees:[81]\\r\\nThe Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries. While other organs of the UN can only make \\"recommendations\\" to member states, the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member states have agreed to carry out, under the terms of Charter Article 25.[82] The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council resolutions.[83]\\r\\nThe Security Council is made up of fifteen member states, consisting of five permanent membersChina, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesand ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date)Bolivia (term ends 2018), Egypt (2017), Ethiopia (2018), Italy (2018), Japan (2017), Kazakhstan (2018), Senegal (2017), Sweden (2018), Ukraine (2017), Uruguay (2017).[84] The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis.[85] The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.[86]\\r\\nThe UN Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General, assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide.[87] It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by UN bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies.[88]\\r\\nThe Secretary-General acts as the de facto spokesperson and leader of the UN. The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization's \\"chief administrative officer\\".[89] Article 99 of the charter states that the Secretary-General can bring to the Security Council's attention \\"any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\\", a phrase that Secretaries-General since Trygve Lie have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage.[90] The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues.[91]\\r\\nThe Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly, after being recommended by the Security Council, where the permanent members have veto power. There are no specific criteria for the post, but over the years it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years.[92] The current Secretary-General is Ant܇nio Guterres, who replaced Ban Ki-moon in 2017.\\r\\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the primary judicial organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.[94][95]\\r\\nIt is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague, sharing the building with the Hague Academy of International Law, a private centre for the study of international law. The ICJ's primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states. The court has heard cases related to war crimes, illegal state interference, ethnic cleansing, and other issues.[96] The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions.[94]\\r\\nThe Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social co-operation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members, which are elected by the General Assembly for a three-year term. The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. The council has one annual meeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations.[97][98] Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.[97][99]\\r\\nECOSOC's subsidiary bodies include the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which advises UN agencies on issues relating to indigenous peoples; the United Nations Forum on Forests, which co-ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management; the United Nations Statistical Commission, which co-ordinates information-gathering efforts between agencies; and the Commission on Sustainable Development, which co-ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working towards sustainable development. ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non-governmental organizations;[97] by 2004, more than 2,200 organizations had received this status.[100]\\r\\nThe UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties.[101] Some best-known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through the work of the WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).[102]\\r\\nWith the addition of South Sudan 14 July 2011,[104] there are 193 UN member states, including all undisputed independent states apart from Vatican City.[105][d] The UN Charter outlines the rules for membership:\\r\\nIn addition, there are two non-member observer states of the United Nations General Assembly: the Holy See (which holds sovereignty over Vatican City) and the State of Palestine.[107] The Cook Islands and Niue, both states in free association with New Zealand, are full members of several UN specialized agencies and have had their \\"full treaty-making capacity\\" recognized by the Secretariat.[108]\\r\\nThe Group of 77 at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations, designed to promote its members' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the UN. Seventy-seven nations founded the organization, but by November 2013 the organization had since expanded to 133 member countries.[109] The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the \\"Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries\\" issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The group held its first major meeting in Algiers in 1967, where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures.[110]\\r\\nThe UN, after approval by the Security Council, sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed \\"Blue Helmets\\" for their distinctive gear.[111][112] The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.[113]\\r\\nIn September 2013, the UN had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on 15 missions. The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), which included 20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir. UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.[114]\\r\\nA study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace.[115] Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activismmostly spearheaded by the UNhas been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period.[116] Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950ÿ53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990ÿ91).[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971,[118] the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s,[119] and the Rwandan genocide in 1994.[120] Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992ÿ93 during the Somali Civil War.[121] UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[122] Haiti,[123] Liberia,[124] Sudan and what is now South Sudan,[125] Burundi, and Ivory Coast.[126] Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010ÿ13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[127]\\r\\nIn addition to peacekeeping, the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament. Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation.[82] The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter, resulting in the first resolution of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for \\"the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction\\".[128] The UN has been involved with arms-limitation treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty (1967), the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968), the Seabed Arms Control Treaty (1971), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), the Chemical Weapons Convention (1992), and the Ottawa Treaty (1997), which prohibits landmines.[129] Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues: the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission.[130]\\r\\nOne of the UN's primary purposes is \\"promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\", and member states pledge to undertake \\"joint and separate action\\" to protect these rights.[101][131]\\r\\nIn 1948, the General Assembly adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drafted by a committee headed by Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor, and including the French lawyer Ren Cassin. The document proclaims basic civil, political, and economic rights common to all human beings, though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting.[132] The Declaration serves as a \\"common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\\" rather than a legally binding document, but it has become the basis of two binding treaties, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[133] In practice, the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution, though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses.[134]\\r\\nIn 1979, the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989.[135] With the end of the Cold War, the push for human rights action took on new impetus.[136] The United Nations Commission on Human Rights was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the UN, following the recommendation of that year's World Conference on Human Rights. Jacques Fomerand, a scholar of the UN, describes this organization's mandate as \\"broad and vague\\", with only \\"meagre\\" resources to carry it out.[137] In 2006, it was replaced by a Human Rights Council consisting of 47 nations.[138] Also in 2006, the General Assembly passed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,[139] and in 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of LGBT people.[140]\\r\\nOther UN bodies responsible for women's rights issues include United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, a commission of ECOSOC founded in 1946; the United Nations Development Fund for Women, created in 1976; and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, founded in 1979.[141] The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples, held its first session in 2002.[142]\\r\\nMillennium Development Goals[143]\\r\\nAnother primary purpose of the UN is \\"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character\\".[131] Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal, primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and ECOSOC.[144] In 2000, the 192 UN member states agreed to achieve eight Millennium Development Goals by 2015.[145]\\r\\nThe UN Development Programme (UNDP), an organization for grant-based technical assistance founded in 1945, is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development. The organization also publishes the UN Human Development Index, a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty, literacy, education, life expectancy, and other factors.[146][147] The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), also founded in 1945, promotes agricultural development and food security.[148] UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund) was created in 1946 to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child.[149][150]\\r\\nThe World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are independent, specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework, according to a 1947 agreement. They were initially formed separately from the UN through the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944.[151] The World Bank provides loans for international development, while the IMF promotes international economic co-operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries.[152]\\r\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy.[153] The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic.[154] The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.[155]\\r\\nAlong with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN often takes a leading role in co-ordinating emergency relief.[156] The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year.[156][157] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works to protect the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people.[158] UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.[159]\\r\\nSince the UN's creation, over 80 colonies have attained independence. The General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers. The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the UN Committee on Decolonization, created in 1962.[160] The committee lists seventeen remaining \\"Non-Self-Governing Territories\\", the largest and most populous of which is Western Sahara.[161]\\r\\nBeginning with the formation of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts.[162] In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming.[163] The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.[164]\\r\\nThe UN also declares and co-ordinates international observances, periods of time to observe issues of international interest or concern. Examples include World Tuberculosis Day, Earth Day, and the International Year of Deserts and Desertification.[165]\\r\\nThe UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member. This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay, as measured by its gross national income (GNI), with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income.[167] The two-year budget for 2012ÿ13 was $5.512 billion in total.[168]\\r\\nThe Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations. Thus, there is a \\"ceiling\\" rate, setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget. In December 2000, the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States. As part of that revision, the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22%.[169] For the least developed countries (LDCs), a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied.[167] In addition to the ceiling rates, the minimum amount assessed to any member nation (or \\"floor\\" rate) is set at 0.001% of the UN budget ($55,120 for the two year budget 2013ÿ2014).[170]\\r\\nA large share of the UN's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security, and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget.[171] The peacekeeping budget for the 2015ÿ16 fiscal year was $8.27 billion, supporting 82,318 troops deployed in 15 missions around the world.[114] UN peace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members, who must approve all peacekeeping operations. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries. In 2017, the top 8 providers of assessed financial contributions to UN peacekeeping operations were the United States (28.47%), China (10.25%), Japan (9.68%), Germany (6.39%), France (6.28%), United Kingdom (5.77%), Russian Federation (3.99%) and Italy (3.75%).[172]\\r\\nSpecial UN programmes not included in the regular budget, such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme, are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments, corporations, and private individuals.[173][174]\\r\\nA number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskj?ld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, Ren Cassin (1968), a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter for his role in the organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.[175]\\r\\nSince its founding, there have been many calls for reform of the UN but little consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work. There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council's membership to be increased, for different ways of electing the UN's Secretary-General, and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly. Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is \\"the NorthÿSouth split\\" between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations. Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.[176]\\r\\nAfter World War II, the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin (\\"contraption\\"), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries.[177] Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to deal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, \\"You can't spell communism without U.N.\\"[178] In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime) that \\"free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society.\\"[179][180][181] In contrast, the French President, Fran?ois Hollande, stated in 2012 that \\"France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and bring an end to all crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance.\\"[182] Critics such as Dore Gold, an Israeli diplomat, Robert S. Wistrich, a British scholar, Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar, Mark Dreyfus, an Australian politician, and the Anti-Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive.[183] In September 2015, Saudi Arabia's Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the UN Human Rights Council panel that appoints independent experts,[184] a move criticized by human rights groups.[185][186]\\r\\nSince 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has been excluded from the UN and since then has always been rejected in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.[187][188]\\r\\nCritics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the Joint Inspection Unit to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the US withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced. In 1994, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog.[189] In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published \\"Somalia: The Missed Opportunities\\",[190] a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia, showing that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies; when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvisation.[191] In 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil-for-Food Programmein which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctionshad suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of kickbacks. An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved, as well as raising \\"significant\\" questions about the role of Kojo Annan, the son of Kofi Annan.[192]\\r\\nIn evaluating the UN as a whole, Jacques Fomerand writes that the \\"accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms. Progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions.\\"[193] Evaluating the first 50 years of the UN's history, the author Stanley Meisler writes that \\"the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders, but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless\\", citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts.[194] The British historian Paul Kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks, \\"when all its aspects are considered, the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and ... will bring benefits to our children's and grandchildren's generations as well.\\"[195]\\r\\nOfficial websites\\r\\nOther","input":"When did the united nations come into existence?"},{"output":"Great Basin bristlecone pine","context":"This is a list of the oldest known trees, as reported in reliable sources. Definitions of what constitutes an individual tree vary. In addition, tree ages are derived from a variety of sources, including documented \\"tree-ring\\" count core samples, and from estimates. For these reasons, this article presents three lists of \\"oldest trees,\\" each using varying criteria.\\r\\nThere are three tables of trees, which are listed by age and species. The first table includes trees for which a minimum age has been directly determined, either through counting or cross-referencing tree rings or through radiocarbon dating. Many of these trees may be even older than their listed ages, but the oldest wood in the tree has rotted away. For some old trees, so much of the centre is missing that their age cannot be directly determined. Instead, estimates are made based on the tree's size and presumed growth rate. The second table includes trees with these estimated ages. The last table lists clonal colonies in which no individual tree trunks may be remarkably old but in which the organism as a whole is thought to be very old.\\r\\nThe current record-holders for individual, non-clonal trees are the Great Basin bristlecone pine trees from California and Nevada, in the United States. Through tree-ring cross-referencing, they have been shown to be more than five millennia old.\\r\\nA clonal colony can survive for much longer than an individual tree. A colony of 47,000 quaking aspen trees (nicknamed \\"Pando\\"), covering 106 acres (43?ha) in the Fishlake National Forest of Utah, is considered one of the oldest and largest organisms in the world. The colony has been estimated to be 80,000 years old, although tree ring samples date individual, above-ground, trees at only an average of about 130 years.[1][2][3][4] A colony of Huon pine trees covering 2.5 acres (1.0?ha) on Mount Read, Tasmania is estimated to be around 10,000 years old, as determined by DNA samples taken from pollen collected from the sediment of a nearby lake. Individual trees in this group date to no more than 4,000 years old, as determined by tree ring samples.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOlea europea L. var. europaea\\r\\nNote: The ages of the trees in this list are speculative and probably unreliable.\\r\\nAs with all long-lived plant and fungal species, no individual part of a clonal colony is alive (in the sense of active metabolism) for more than a very small fraction of the life of the entire clone. Some clonal colonies may be fully connected via their root systems, while most are not actually interconnected, but are genetically identical clones which populated an area through vegetative reproduction. Ages for clonal colonies, often based on current growth rates, are estimates.[citation needed]","input":"What is the oldest living tree in america?"},{"output":"25 June 1932","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTest kit\\r\\n\\r\\nODI kit\\r\\n\\r\\nT20I kit\\r\\n\\r\\nThe India national cricket team, also known as Team India and Men in Blue, is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough cricket was introduced to India by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in Calcutta (currently known as Kolkata) in 1792, India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath, all-rounder Kapil Dev and the Indian spin quartet of Erapalli Prasanna, Srinivas Venkataraghavan, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar\\r\\nand  Bishen Singh Bedi.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in Australia, England and South Africa. It has won the Cricket World Cup twice ÿ in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and in 2011 under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After winning the 2011 World Cup, India became only the third team after West Indies and Australia to have won the World Cup more than once,[8] and the first cricket team to win the World Cup at home. It also won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. It was also the joint champions of 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2 May 2018, India is ranked first in Test 2nd in ODIs and third in T20Is by the ICC.[9] Virat Kohli is the current captain of the team across all formats, while the head coach is Ravi Shastri.[10] The Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably with Pakistan, the political arch-rival of India. However, in recent times, rivalries with nations like Australia, South Africa and England have also gained prominence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.[11] In 1848, the Parsi community in Bombay formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877.[12] By 1912, the Parsis, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year.[12] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy ÿ two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian team went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia was invited to The Imperial Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932, led by CK Nayudu, who was considered as the best Indian batsman at the time.[14] The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London. The team was not strong in their batting at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs.[15] In 1933, the first Test series in India was played between India and England with matches in Bombay, Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Madras (now Chennai). England won the series 2ÿ0.[16] The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and '40s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India didn't play any Test cricket due to the Second World War. The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Sir Donald Bradman's Invincibles (a name given to the Australia national cricket team of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia won the five-match series 4ÿ0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer.[17] India subsequently played their first Test series at home not against England against the West Indies in 1948. West Indies won the 5-Test series 1ÿ0.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras in 1952.[19] Later in the same year, they won their first Test series, which was against Pakistan.[20] They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956. However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. On 24 August 1959, India lost by an innings in the Test to complete the only 5ÿ0 whitewash ever inflicted by England. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961ÿ62 and also won a home series against New Zealand. They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967ÿ68.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key to India's bowling in the 1970s were the Indian spin quartet ÿ Bishen Bedi, E.A.S. Prasanna, BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan. This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath. Indian pitches have had the tendency to support spin and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar. Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while Dilip Sardesai's 112 played a big part in their one Test win.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advent of One Day International (ODI) cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considered strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defensive approach to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup. Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and was particularly strong at home, where their combination of stylish batsmen and beguiling spinners were at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976, when they chased 403 to win, thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain Clive Lloyd dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack instead. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without any individual batsman scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by Mohinder Amarnath. This innings was only the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammed Azharuddin, Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounders Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and the two-time defending champions West Indies in the final at Lords, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent. India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, Javagal Srinath, India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best-ranked team in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter failing to reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3ÿ0 on a tour of Australia and then 2ÿ0 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as \\"the Indian cricket's worst hour\\". However, the new core ÿ Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly ÿ swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright as India's first ever foreign coach. India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. Australian captain Steve Waugh labelled India as the \\"Final Frontier\\" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.[23] Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa where they reached the final, only to be beaten by Australia. The 2003ÿ04 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1ÿ1 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1ÿ1. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, and the coming of age of players like Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh. A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were selected to play for the ICC World XI in the 2005 \\"SuperTest\\" against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.[24] Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4ÿ1 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1ÿ0 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2ÿ1. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2006, India played and won its first ever Twenty20 international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like Robin Uthappa saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup. However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter winning the Test series against England in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team, following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007ÿ08, they toured Australia where India lost the highly controversial home Test series 2ÿ1 but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2ÿ0 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2ÿ0 in the home test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1ÿ1.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2011, India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup by defeating Sri Lanka in the final, thus becoming the third team after West Indies and Australia to win the World Cup twice, the previous win being in 1983. Gautam Gambhir and the skipper Dhoni led the way with 97 and 91* respectively.[30] India also became the first team to win the World Cup on home soil.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia were whitewashed 4ÿ0 in away Test series by England in August 2011 due to which England replaced India as the No. 1 Test team in the rankings.[31] This series was followed by another 4ÿ0 whitewash of India in January 2012 in Australia. The disastrous whitewashes saw the retirement of Dravid and VVS Laxman from Test cricket in 2012. Tendulkar retired in November 2013 after his 200th Test match. With Ganguly having retired in 2008, this period signalled the end of the fabled middle-order batting line-up India had for a decade. 2012 signalled a rough period for Indian cricket as they were beaten 2ÿ1 by England at home in the Test series. This was the first Team India were beaten by England at home in the modern era. This was followed by a 2ÿ1 loss in the ODI series against Pakistan, India's arch-rivals, at home. India was then knocked out in the second round of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. India also failed to qualify for the 2012 Asia Cup final which closed out a disappointing 2012 for the Indian cricket team. 2013 saw a resurgence in Indian cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2013, India returned the favour to Australia and whitewashed them 4ÿ0 at home in a Test series. India then beat the Aussies 3ÿ2 in the 7-match ODI series and won the one-off T20I. However, India lost heavily against New Zealand and South Africa away from home and led to heavy criticism of Indian cricketers for not being able to perform overseas. India defeated England in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy final and Mahendra Singh Dhoni became the first captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20 and ICC Champions Trophy. This was followed by a victory in the West Indies Triangular Series in 2013 consisting of India, West Indies and Sri Lanka. In 2014, India toured Bangladesh and England. Although they beat the former 2ÿ0 in 3 One Day Internationals, Team India were beaten 3ÿ1 in 5 Test matches by England. This series included a famous win for the Indian team in the first match of the series at Lord's. The Test series was followed by a 3ÿ1 win for the Indians in a 5-match ODI series and a loss in a one-off T20, both against England.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia failed to reach the final of the Asia Cup yet again in 2014. In the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 hosted in Bangladesh, India narrowly missed out on another ICC trophy by losing to Sri Lanka in the final. This tournament saw the rise of Virat Kohli as one of the best limited overs batsmen in world cricket, as he was adjudged the man of the series. India soon comprehensively beat Sri Lanka and West Indies in ODI series to cement their position at the top of the ODI rankings. India toured Australia towards the end of 2014 for a 4-match Test series, which is remembered for MS Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket after the end of the second Test. Virat Kohli was appointed as the captain of Team India in Test matches but he was unable to turn the series around and India lost 2ÿ0. Kohli's first series win as captain came away from home in a 3-match Test series vs Sri Lanka, which signalled the beginning of an unbeaten Test series run for India.\\r\\n\\r\\n2015 saw the beginning of India's dominance at home in Test matches under new captain Virat Kohli when they comprehensively beat South Africa. This series was the beginning of an unbeaten streak of 19 Test matches for India which was brought to an end by Australia in early 2017. This series also saw the emergence of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja as two of the best spinners and all-rounders. They spun webs around touring batsmen, much like the spinning quartet of the 1970s. This was followed by limited overs victories over Australia and Sri Lanka away from home. India was knocked out of the 2015 World Cup in the semi-final stage, to eventual winners Australia. India began 2016 by winning the 2016 Asia Cup, remaining unbeaten throughout the tournament, beating Pakistan along the way. India were favourites to win the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 which was being held at home, but they lost in the semi-final to eventual champions West Indies. Virat Kohli was again named the man of the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, \\"The Grand Home Season\\" began for India, including series at home against New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia. India whitewashed New Zealand to regain the number one ranking in Test cricket after almost 10 years. Before the series against England in November 2016, MS Dhoni resigned as captain of India in limited overs, thus handing the captaincy to Virat Kohli across all formats. India beat England across all three formats, with a notable 4ÿ0 win in the Test series. This was followed by Test series wins against Bangladesh and Australia,  which meant India reclaimed the Border Gavaskar Trophy. Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer of all time to reach 250 wickets; he and Ravindra Jadeja occupied the top two spots in both the ICC Bowlers and All-Rounders rankings at the time. In the process, India became the third team (after South Africa and Australia) to have won their most recent Test series against all the other Test-playing nations. India holds an unbeaten streak of 8 consecutive Test series wins as of 19 August 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia defeated Pakistan in their first game of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, winning by a convincing 124-run margin,[32] but lost their second game of the group against Sri Lanka by 7 wickets despite posting a total of 321.[33] In their final group game against South Africa, a must-win encounter, India won comfortably and sealed a spot in the semi-finals, against Bangladesh.[34] India comfortably won the match by 9 wickets, and faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final, the first time they had met at this stage of a tournament since 2007.[35] In an anti-climax, considering India were the clear favourites, Pakistan defeated India comfortably by 180 runs in the final, outclassing them across all three departments.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia beat the West Indies 3ÿ1 in a 5-match ODI series in the Caribbean in July 2017,[37] but lost to the same opposition in a one-off T20I.[38] India then toured Sri Lanka, and comprehensively defeated them 3-0 in a three-match Test series, the first time India had whitewashed a team away from home in a Test series with at least three games.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body for the Indian cricket team and first-class cricket in India. The Board has been operating since 1929 and represents India at the International Cricket Council. It is amongst the richest sporting organisations in the world. It sold media rights for India's matches from 2006ÿ2010 for US$612,000,000.[40] It manages the Indian team's sponsorships, its future tours and team selection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Cricket Council determines India's upcoming matches through its future tours program. However, the BCCI, with its influential financial position in the cricketing world, has often challenged the ICC's program and called for more series between India, Australia and England which are more likely to earn more revenue as opposed to tours with Bangladesh or Zimbabwe.[41] In the past, the BCCI has also come into conflict with the ICC regarding sponsorships[42] and the legitimacy of the ICC Champions Trophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelection for the Indian cricket team occurs through the BCCI's zonal selection policy, where each of the five zones is represented with one selector and one of the members nominated by BCCI as the Chairman of the selection committee. This has sometimes led to controversy as to whether these selectors are biased towards their zones.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current chairman of the selection committee is  M. S. K. Prasad. Devang Gandhi, Sarandeep Singh, Jatin Paranjpe, and Gagan Khoda are the other members of the selection committee from 21 September 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince colours have made their way into international cricket, the Indian cricket team has chosen blue as their primary colour and orange/red as their secondary colour and have worn one or the other shade of blue. The blue colour of their uniform has also earned them the nickname of \\"Men in Blue\\". With the advent of the World Series Cup in the 1970s, each team was to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms. The Indian team elected to wear light-blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour. Even during the 1999 Cricket World Cup, the secondary colour on the Indian cricket team's clothing was yellow. However, this has since been replaced with the tricolour. In the past, the Indian ODI outfits were changed to different shades of blue, mostly darker than the current,[44] and the team donned navy blue during 1992,[45] and then the sky blue colour for the next decade. Indian team has got a new kit from 2009 which is feroza blue with India written on it in orange.[46] From October 2010, the team is once again using a light blue shade though not as light as the previous sky blue one, with India written in orange, and shades of the tricolour at the sides. The kit sponsor for the Indian cricket team is Nike, which in 2005 bought the kit rights in a $27.2?million contract with BCCI.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to their love for blue colour Nike with Board for Control of Cricket in India launched the mega campaign called \\"Bleed Blue\\" for the support of Indian team in 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup which turned out to be a huge success and people over the internet and places adopted this to cheer for India.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nA new ultramarine blue coloured jersey of the one-day cricket team was released on 20 October 2010[49] for the upcoming tours and ICC Cricket World Cup. The jersey has been designed by team's apparel and kit sponsor Nike. Previously, the Indian cricket team has worn a darker shade of blue and before that, the team has worn sky blue. The vertical tricolour band has been made on both sides in comparison to just one side in the previous shirt. OPPO, the manufacturer of Chinese electronics is the official team sponsor logo is on the central part of the jersey (above orange coloured INDIA logo) and on the right arm Nike logo is visible. The name and jersey number of the player are printed in orange at the back while on the chest the logo of BCCI is on the left side. The one-day cap was also sky blue with the BCCI logo on the front.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen playing first-class cricket, in addition to their cricket whites, Indian fielders sometimes wear a sunhat, which is dark blue and has a wide brim, with the BCCI logo in the middle of the front of the hat. Helmets are coloured similarly. Some players sport the Indian flag on their helmet. The current kit sponsor for the Indian team is Nike and current team sponsor is OPPO (since April, 2017).[50] Previously, the Indian team was sponsored by Star India (2014-2017),[51] Sahara India Pariwar (2002-2013) and Wills (1993-2002).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous world-renowned cricket stadiums located in India. Most grounds are under the administration of various state cricket boards as opposed to being under the control of the BCCI. The Bombay Gymkhana was the first ground in India to host a full-scale cricket match featuring an Indian cricket team. This was between the Parsis and the Europeans in 1877. The first stadium to host a Test match in India was also the Gymkhana Ground in Bombay in 1933, the only Test it ever hosted. The second and third Tests in the 1933 series were hosted at Eden Gardens and Chepauk. The Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a 5-Test series. 21 stadiums in India have hosted at least one official Test match. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of world-class cricket stadiums in India, with multiple Test venues in Indore, Chandigarh Mohali, Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Rajkot, Ranchi, Pune, Dharamshala and Nagpur.\\r\\n\\r\\nEden Gardens in Kolkata has hosted the most Tests, and also has the second-largest seating capacity of any cricket stadium in the world, being capable of holding more than 66,000 spectators. Founded in 1864, it is one of the most historical stadiums in India, having hosted numerous historical and controversial matches.[52] Other major stadiums in India include the Feroz Shah Kotla, which was established in 1883 and hosted memorable matches including Anil Kumble's ten wickets in an innings haul against Pakistan. For the last two years, the ground has been undergoing renovation.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bombay Gymkhana hosted the first ever Test match in India which is the only Test it has hosted to date. Wankhede Stadium, established in 1974, has a capacity to hold 33,000 spectators and is currently the most popular venue in the city. It has hosted 24 Test matches. It was the unofficial successor of the Brabourne Stadium, which is also located in Mumbai. Mumbai is often considered the cricketing capital of India because of its fans and the talent it produces (see Mumbai cricket team) and thus the stadium regularly hosts major Test matches.[54] The M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk is also considered to be an important historical Indian cricket ground, established in the early 1900s it was the site of India's first Test victory.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated on 25 June 2018 [91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-two men have captained the Indian cricket team in at least one Test match, although only six have led the team in more than 25 matches, and six have captained the team in ODIs but not Tests. India's first captain was CK Nayudu, who led the team in four matches against England: one in England in 1932 and a series of three matches at home in 1933ÿ34. Lala Amarnath, India's fourth captain, led the team in its first Test match after Indian independence. He also captained the side to its first Test victory and first series win, both in a three-match series at home against Pakistan in 1952ÿ53. From 1952 until 1961ÿ62, India had a number of captains such as Vijay Hazare, Polly Umrigar and Nari Contractor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nawab of Pataudi, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, was the team's captain for 36 Test matches from 1961ÿ62 to 1969ÿ70, returning for another four matches against West Indies in 1974ÿ75. In the early years of his captaincy tenure, the team was whitewashed in the West Indies, England and Australia. However, in 1967ÿ68, Pataudi led India on its maiden New Zealand tour, which ended in India winning the Test series 3ÿ1. In 1970ÿ71, Ajit Wadekar took over the captaincy from Pataudi. Under Wadekar's captaincy, India registered its first Test series win in the West Indies and England. India played its first ODI in 1974, also under his captaincy. India won its first ODI under the captaincy of Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan in the 1975 Cricket World Cup, against East Africa. Between 1975ÿ76 and 1978ÿ79, Bishen Singh Bedi captained the team in 22 Tests and 4 ODIs, winning 6 Tests and one ODI.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunil Gavaskar took over as Test and ODI captain in 1978ÿ79, leading India in 47 Test matches and 37 ODIs, winning 9 Tests and 14 ODIs. He was succeeded by Kapil Dev in the 1980s, who captained for 34 Test matches, including 4 victories. Kapil Dev led India to victory in 39 of his 74 ODIs in charge, including the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Kapil Dev also captained India's 2ÿ0 Test series victory in England in 1986. Between 1987ÿ88 and 1989ÿ90, India had three captains in Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri and Krishnamachari Srikkanth. Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent[citation needed] and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early-1989 and a stand-off with the Indian cricket board (BCCI).\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia has had six regular Test captains since Mohammad Azharuddin took charge in 1989. Azharuddin led the team in 47 Test matches from 1989ÿ90 to 1998ÿ99, winning 14, and in 174 ODIs, winning 90. He was followed by Sachin Tendulkar, who captained the team in 25 Test matches and 73 ODIs in the late 1990s; Tendulkar was relatively unsuccessful[92][93] as a captain, winning only 4 Test matches and 23 ODIs. He was replaced as ODI captain by Ajay Jadeja and then by Sourav Ganguly.\\r\\n\\r\\nGanguly became the regular captain of the team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000. He remained captain until 2005ÿ06 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49 Test matches in charge and 76 of his 146 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. India lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia. Rahul Dravid took over as Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2007, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was named as the new captain of the ODI and T20I teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team to the inaugural World Twenty20 title. Anil Kumble was appointed Test captain in November 2007, but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded him as the Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian team held the number one position in the Test rankings for 21 months (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine straight wins).[94] Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Thus, Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. He is widely regarded as India's best ever captain. However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014 and Dhoni retired from Test cricket in December 2014, with Virat Kohli being named as the new Test captain. Dhoni resigned as captain of the ODI and T20 teams in January 2017 and Kohli succeeded him at the position.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Kohli's captaincy, India was unbeaten in 19 Test matches, starting from a 3ÿ0 series win over New Zealand and ending with a 2ÿ1 series win over Australia. India has an unbeaten streak of winning 9 consecutive Test series as of Dec 2017, starting with a 2ÿ1 series win over Sri Lanka. India also became only the third team after Australia and South Africa to have won their most recent Test series simultaneously against all the other Test playing nations. As per winning percentage in Test matches, Kohli is India's most successful test captain, having won more than 61% of Test matches (at least 2 games).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent results and forthcoming fixtures of India in international cricket:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis lists all the players who have played for India in the past 12 months and the forms in which they have played.

He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests and ODIs. The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by Virender Sehwag in Chennai. It is the second triple century in Test cricket by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan. The team's highest ever score was a 759/7 against England at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai in 2016, while its lowest was 42 against England in 1974. In ODIs, the team's highest score is 418/5 against West Indies at Indore in 2011ÿ12. India score 413ÿ5 in a match against Bermuda in 2007 World Cup which is the highest score ever in Cricket World Cup history. In the same match, India set a world record of the highest winning margin in an ODI match of 257 runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia has also had some very strong bowling figures, with spin bowler Anil Kumble being a member of the elite group of 3 bowlers who have taken 600 Test wickets. In 1999, Anil Kumble emulated Jim Laker to become the second bowler to take all ten wickets in a Test match innings when he took 10 wickets for 74 runs against Pakistan at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the Indian cricket team's records are also world records, for example Sachin Tendulkar's century tally (in Tests and ODIs) and run tally (also in both Tests and ODIs). Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 183 not out against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the world record score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. The Indian cricket team also holds the record sequence of 17 successful run-chases in ODIs,[99] which ended in a dramatic match against the West Indies in May 2006, which India lost by just 1 run when Yuvraj Singh was bowled by Dwayne Bravo's full toss.\\r\\n\\r\\nSachin Tendulkar was the first batsman to score 200 runs (he was unbeaten on 200 from 147 deliveries including 25x4 and 3x6) in a single ODI innings, on 24 February 2010 against South Africa in Gwalior. On 8 December 2011, this achievement was eclipsed by compatriot Virender Sehwag, who scored 219 runs from 149 deliveries (25x4 | 7x6) versus West Indies in Indore. On 13 November 2014 the record was broken by another Indian opening batsmen, Rohit Sharma, who scored 264 runs from 173 deliveries (33x4 | 9x6) against Sri Lanka in Kolkata. In 2013, MS Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, Virat Kohli became the first cricketer to win back-to-back man of the series awards in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2014 ICC World Twenty20. In 2017, Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer in history to reach 250 wickets. He and Ravindra Jadeja are considered to be the best bowlers in Test cricket and occupy the top two spots in the rankings for Test bowlers as of May 2017. Virat Kohli became the first captain in history to score double tons in three consecutive series, against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTest record versus other nations\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Test runs for India[102]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Test wickets for India[103]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nODI record versus other nations\\r\\n\\r\\nMost ODI runs for India[106]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost ODI wickets for India[107]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT20I record versus other nations\\r\\n\\r\\nMost T20I runs for India[110]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost T20I wickets for India[111]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers in bold text are still active with India.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the massive Indian diaspora in nations like Australia, England and South Africa, a large Indian fan turnout is expected whenever India plays in each of these nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been a number of official fan groups that have been formed over the years, including the Swami Army or Bharat Army,[112] the Indian equivalent of the Barmy Army, that were very active in their support when India toured Australia in 2003/2004. They are known to attribute a number of popular Indian songs to the cricket team.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nFan rivalry and cross-border tension has created a strong rivalry between the Indian and the Pakistani cricket teams. In tours between these two nations, cricket visas are often employed to accommodate for the tens of thousands of fans wishing to cross the border to watch cricket. This intense fan dedication is one of the major causes of the BCCI's financial success.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there are downsides to having such a cricket-loving population. Many Indians hold cricket very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player effigies being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes.[115] In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as one of the reasons for Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at Brabourne Stadium in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks.[116] A similar event occurred during the 1996 Cricket World Cup, where India were losing the semi-final to Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens. In this case, the fan behaviour was directed at the Indian team in disappointment at their lacklustre performance. An armed guard had to be placed at the home of captain Mohammad Azharuddin to ensure his safety.[116] Indian fans have also been passionate in their following of Sachin Tendulkar, who has been commonly thought of as one of the best batsmen in the world. Glorified for the bulk of his career, a riot occurred in early 1999 in a Test against Pakistan at Eden Gardens after a collision with Pakistani paceman Shoaib Akhtar saw him run out, forcing police to eject spectators and the game to be played in an empty stadium. Although in 2006, a string of low scores resulted in Tendulkar being booed by the Mumbai crowd when he got out against England[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, fans engage in protests regarding players if they believe that regionalism has affected selection, or because of regional partisan support for local players. In 2005, when Sourav Ganguly was dropped due to lack of form, Ganguly's home state of West Bengal erupted in protests.[118] India later played a match against South Africa in Kolkata, West Bengal. The Indian team was booed by the crowd who supported South Africa instead of India in response to Ganguly's dropping.[citation needed] Similar regional divisions in India regarding selection have also caused protests against the team, with political activists from the regional Kalinga Kamgar Sena party in Odisha disrupting the arrival of the team in Cuttack for an ODI over the lack of a local player in the team, with one activist manhandling coach Greg Chappell.[119] Similar treatment was handed to Sunil Gavaskar in the 1987 World Cup Semi Finals by crowds at Wankhede Stadium when he got bowled by Philip DeFreitas.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nA successful string of results, victories against arch-rivals Pakistan or victory in major tournaments such as the World Cup are greeted with particular ecstasy from the Indian fans.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian women's cricket team has a much lower profile than the men's team. For all national women's cricket teams, the female players are paid much less their male counterparts, and the women's teams do not receive as much popular support or recognition as the men's team. The women's teams also have a less packed schedule compared to men's teams and play fewer matches. The Indian women's cricket team played its first Test match in 1976/7, when they drew with the West Indies in a six-match series.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Women's Cricket World Cup was held in India in 1978 and featured 4 teams. India lost both the matches they have played. Their next appearance in the Test and ODI circuit was against Australia in 1984, in which the Test series was tied but the ODI series was lost in a whitewash.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian women's cricket team has since picked up their form, reaching the finals in the World Cup, but then losing to Australia. The Women's Asia Cup of 2005ÿ06 was won by India, who beat Sri Lanka in the final. They also beat the West Indies in the 2004ÿ05 season, winning the 5 ODI series 5ÿ0. They were knocked out in the group stage of the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup held in India. India reached the final of the 2017 World Cup but lost to England by 9 runs, following which the team was praised by many including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\r\\n\\r\\nJhulan Goswami is the world's leading ODI wicket-taker while Mithali Raj, the captain, is the leading run-scorer in ODI cricket.","input":"When was first test match played by india?"},{"output":"a cleric who functions as an administrative leader","context":"A rector is, in an ecclesiastical sense, a cleric who functions as an administrative leader in some Christian denominations,[1][2] and in Islam.[3]\\r\\nIn contrast, a vicar is also a cleric but functions as an assistant and representative of an administrative leader.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn ancient times bishops, as rulers of cities and provinces, especially in the Papal States, were called rectors, as were administrators of the patrimony of the Church (e.g. rector Siciliae).[6] The Latin term rector was used by Pope Gregory I in Regula Pastoralis as equivalent to the Latin term pastor (shepherd).[6]\\r\\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, a rector is a person who holds the office of presiding over an ecclesiastical institution. The institution may be a particular buildinglike a church (called his rectory church) or shrineor it may be an organization, such as a parish, a mission or quasi-parish, a seminary or house of studies, a university, a hospital or a community of clerics or religious.\\r\\nIf a rector appointed as his employee someone to perform the duties of his office, i.e. to act for him \\"vicariously\\", that employee was termed his vicar. Thus, the tithes of a parish are the legal property of the person who holds the office of rector, and are not the property of his vicar, who is not an office-holder but a mere employee, remunerated by a stipend, i.e. a salary, payable by his employer the rector. Thus, a parish vicar is the vicarious agent of his rector, whilst, higher up the scale, the Pope is called the Vicar of Christ, acting vicariously for the ultimate superior in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.\\r\\nThe 1983 Code of Canon Law, for the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, explicitly mentions as special cases three offices of rectors:\\r\\nHowever, these are not the only officials who exercise their functions using the title of rector. Since the term rector refers to the function of the particular office, a number of officials are not referred to as rectors even though they are rectors in actual practice. The diocesan bishop, for instance, is himself a rector, since he presides over both an ecclesiastical organization (the diocese) and an ecclesiastical building (his cathedral). In many dioceses, the bishop delegates the day-to-day operation of the cathedral to a priest, who is often incorrectly called a rector but whose specific title is plebanus or \\"people's pastor\\", especially if the cathedral operates as a parish church. Therefore, because a priest is designated head of a cathedral parish, he cannot be both rector and pastor, as a rector cannot canonically hold title over a parish (c.556).\\r\\nAs a further example, the pastor of a parish (parochus) is pastor (not rector) over both his parish and the parish church. Finally, a president of a Catholic university is rector over the university and, if a priest, often the rector of any church that the university may operate, on the basis that it is not a canonical establishment of a parish (c. 557 3).\\r\\nIn some religious congregations of priests, rector is the title of the local superior of a house or community of the order. For instance, a community of several dozen Jesuit priests might include the pastor and priests assigned to a parish church next door, the faculty of a Jesuit high school across the street, and the priests in an administrative office down the block. However, the community as a local installation of Jesuit priests is headed by a rector.\\r\\nRector general is the title given to the superior general of certain religious orders, e.g. the Clerics Regular of the Mother of God, Pallottines.\\r\\nThere are some other uses of this title, such as for residence hall directors at the University of Notre Dame which were once (and to some extent still are) run in a seminary-like fashion. This title is used similarly at the University of Portland, another institution of the Congregation of Holy Cross.\\r\\nThe Pope is called \\"rector of the world\\" during the discontinued papal coronation ceremony that was once part of the papal inauguration.[6][a]\\r\\nPermanent rector is an obsolete term used in the United States prior to the codification of the 1917 Code of Canon Law. Canon Law grants a type of tenure to pastors (parochus) of parishes, giving them certain rights against arbitrary removal by the bishop of their diocese.[6] In order to preserve their flexibility and authority in assigning priests to parishes, bishops in the United States until that time did not actually appoint priests as pastors, but as \\"permanent rectors\\" of their parishes: the \\"permanent\\" gave the priest a degree of confidence in the security in his assignment, but the \\"rector\\" rather than \\"pastor\\" preserved the bishop's absolute authority to reassign clergy. Hence, many older parishes list among their early leaders priests with the postnominal letters \\"P.R.\\" (as in, a plaque listing all of the pastors of a parish, with \\"Rev. John Smith, P.R.\\"). This practice was discontinued and today priests are normally assigned as pastors of parishes, and bishops in practice reassign them at will (though there are still questions about the canonical legality of this).\\r\\nIn Anglican churches, a rector is one type of parish priest. Historically, parish priests in the Church of England were divided into rectors, vicars, and perpetual curates. The parish clergy and church was supported by tithes, a form of local tax (traditionally, as the etymology of tithe suggests, of ten percent) levied on the personal as well as agricultural output of the parish. Roughly speaking, the distinction was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes going to the lay holder, or impropriator, of the living); a perpetual curate with a small cure and often aged or infirm received neither greater nor lesser tithes, and received only a small salary (paid sometimes by the diocese). Quite commonly, parishes that had a rector as priest also had glebe lands attached to the parish. The rector was then responsible for the repair of the chancel of his churchthe part dedicated to the sacred officeswhile the rest of the building was the responsibility of the parish.\\r\\nThis rectorial responsibility persists, in perpetuity, with the occupiers of the original rectorial land where it has been sold. This is called chancel repair liability, and affects institutional, corporate and private owners of land once owned by around 5,200 churches in England and Wales.[7] (See also Church of England#Organisation) Today, the roles of a rector and a vicar are essentially the same in England. Which of the two titles is held by the parish priest is historical. Some parishes have a rector, others a vicar.\\r\\nThe only part of the Church of England where the two terms do still have different meanings is the Deanery of Jersey. A Jersey rector is appointed to one of the island's twelve historic parishes and as such has a role in the civil parish administration alongside the Constable: the parish also takes full responsibility (through levy of rates) for maintaining the church. Vicars are appointed to district churches, have no civil administrative roles by right, and their churches' upkeep is resourced by the members of the congregation.\\r\\nThe term is also now used in the Church of England  in \\"Team Rector\\"  with different meaning, designating the incumbent priest who is first among equals in a \\"team ministry\\" (whereas other incumbent priests in that team are called \\"Team Vicar\\".) (see also curate)\\r\\nIn the Church of Ireland, Scottish Episcopal Church and Anglican Church of Canada, most parish priests are called rectors, not vicars. However, in some dioceses of the Anglican Church of Canada rectors are officially licensed as incumbents to express the diocesan polity of employment of clergy.\\r\\nIn the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the \\"rector\\" is the priest elected to head a self-supporting parish. A priest who is appointed by the bishop to head a parish in the absence of a rector is termed a \\"priest-in-charge\\", as is a priest leading a mission (that is, a congregation which is not self-supporting). \\"Associate priests\\" are priests hired by the parish to supplement the rector in his or her duties while \\"assistant priests\\" are priests resident in the congregation who help on a volunteer basis. The positions of \\"vicar\\" and \\"curate\\" are not recognized in the canons of the entire church. However, some diocesan canons do define \\"vicar\\" as the priest-in-charge of a mission; and \\"curate\\" is often used for assistants, being entirely analogous to the English situation.[8]\\r\\nIn schools affiliated with the Anglican church the title \\"rector\\" is sometimes used in secondary schools and boarding schools, where the headmaster is often a priest.\\r\\nIn many Protestant congregational churches such as Disciples of Christ, United Church of Christ, Evangelical Free Churches, etc. the rector is the person elected to lead the congregation with pastoral duties affixed to their administrative job.\\r\\nIn Islam, a mosque is directed by a rector.[3]","input":"What is a rector of a catholic church?"},{"output":"late 1915","context":"General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.\\r\\nBefore the advent of general relativity, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses, even though Newton himself did not regard the theory as the final word on the nature of gravity. Within a century of Newton's formulation, careful astronomical observation revealed unexplainable variations between the theory and the observations. Under Newton's model, gravity was the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was bothered by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.\\r\\nHowever, experiments and observations show that Einstein's description accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in the orbits of Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, while others are the subject of ongoing research.\\r\\nGeneral relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was the preference of inertial motion within special relativity, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion appeared more satisfactory to him.[1] So, while still working at the patent office in 1907, Einstein had what he would call his \\"happiest thought\\". He realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields.\\r\\nConsequently, in 1907 he wrote an article (published 1908) on acceleration under special relativity.[2] In that article, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the Equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation.\\r\\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article.[3] There, he thought about the case of a uniformly accelerated box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top of a box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.\\r\\nAlso the deflection of light by massive bodies was predicted. Although the approximation was crude, it allowed him to calculate that the deflection is nonzero. German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich publicized Einstein's challenge to scientists around the world.[4] This urged astronomers to detect the deflection of light during a solar eclipse, and gave Einstein confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by Gunnar Nordstr?m was incorrect. But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small by a factor of two, because the approximation he used doesn't work well for things moving at near the speed of light. When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun.\\r\\nAnother of Einstein's notable thought experiments about the nature of the gravitational field is that of the rotating disk (a variant of the Ehrenfest paradox). He imagined an observer performing experiments on a rotating turntable. He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant  than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. The reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but, according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted. Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. This led him to study Riemannian geometry, and to formulate general relativity in this language.\\r\\nIn 1912, Einstein returned to Switzerland to accept a professorship at his alma mater, the ETH. Once back in Zurich, he immediately visited his old ETH classmate Marcel Grossmann, now a professor of mathematics, who introduced him to Riemannian geometry and, more generally, to differential geometry. On the recommendation of Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began exploring the usefulness of general covariance (essentially the use of tensors) for his gravitational theory. For a while Einstein thought that there were problems with the approach, but he later returned to it and, by late 1915, had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today.[5] This theory explains gravitation as distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter.\\r\\nDuring World War I, the work of Central Powers scientists was available only to Central Powers academics, for national security reasons. Some of Einstein's work did reach the United Kingdom and the United States through the efforts of the Austrian Paul Ehrenfest and physicists in the Netherlands, especially 1902 Nobel Prize-winner Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter of Leiden University. After the war ended, Einstein maintained his relationship with Leiden University, accepting a contract as an Extraordinary Professor; for ten years, from 1920 to 1930, he travelled to the Netherlands regularly to lecture.[6]\\r\\nIn 1917, several astronomers accepted Einstein's 1911 challenge from Prague. The Mount Wilson Observatory in California, U.S., published a solar spectroscopic analysis that showed no gravitational redshift.[7] In 1918, the Lick Observatory, also in California, announced that it too had disproved Einstein's prediction, although its findings were not published.[8]\\r\\nHowever, in May 1919, a team led by the British astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed to have confirmed Einstein's prediction of gravitational deflection of starlight by the Sun while photographing a solar eclipse with dual expeditions in Sobral, northern Brazil, and Prncipe, a west African island.[4] Nobel laureate Max Born praised general relativity as the \\"greatest feat of human thinking about nature\\";[9] fellow laureate Paul Dirac was quoted saying it was \\"probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made\\".[10] The international media guaranteed Einstein's global renown.\\r\\nThere have been claims that scrutiny of the specific photographs taken on the Eddington expedition showed the experimental uncertainty to be comparable to the same magnitude as the effect Eddington claimed to have demonstrated, and that a 1962 British expedition concluded that the method was inherently unreliable.[11] The deflection of light during a solar eclipse was confirmed by later, more accurate observations.[12] Some resented the newcomer's fame, notably among some German physicists, who later started the Deutsche Physik (German Physics) movement.[13][14]\\r\\nBy 1912, Einstein was actively seeking a theory in which gravitation was explained as a geometric phenomenon. At the urging of Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began by exploring the use of general covariance (which is essentially the use of curvature tensors) to create a gravitational theory. However, in 1913 Einstein abandoned that approach, arguing that it is inconsistent based on the \\"hole argument\\". In 1914 and much of 1915, Einstein was trying to create field equations based on another approach. When that approach was proven to be inconsistent, Einstein revisited the concept of general covariance and discovered that the hole argument was flawed.[15]\\r\\nWhen Einstein realized that general covariance was actually tenable, he quickly completed the development of the field equations that are named after him. However, he made a now-famous mistake. The field equations he published in October 1915 were\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle R_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the Ricci tensor, and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle T_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\r\\n\\r\\n the energyÿmomentum tensor. This predicted the non-Newtonian perihelion precession of Mercury, and so had Einstein very excited. However, it was soon realized that they were inconsistent with the local conservation of energyÿmomentum unless the universe had a constant density of massÿenergyÿmomentum. In other words, air, rock and even a vacuum should all have the same density. This inconsistency with observation sent Einstein back to the drawing board. However, the solution was all but obvious, and on November 25, 1915 Einstein presented the actual Einstein field equations to the Prussian Academy of Sciences:[16]\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle R}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the Ricci scalar and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ng\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle g_{\\\\mu \\\\nu }}\\r\\n\\r\\n the metric tensor. With the publication of the field equations, the issue became one of solving them for various cases and interpreting the solutions. This and experimental verification have dominated general relativity research ever since.\\r\\nAlthough Einstein is credited with finding the field equations, the German mathematician David Hilbert published them in an article before Einstein's article. This has resulted in accusations of plagiarism against Einstein, although not from Hilbert, and assertions that the field equations should be called the \\"EinsteinÿHilbert field equations\\". However, Hilbert did not press his claim for priority and some[who?] have asserted that Einstein submitted the correct equations before Hilbert amended his own work to include them. This suggests that Einstein developed the correct field equations first, though Hilbert may have reached them later independently (or even learned of them afterwards through his correspondence with Einstein).[17] However, others have criticized those assertions.[18]\\r\\nIn the early years after Einstein's theory was published, Sir Arthur Eddington lent his considerable prestige in the British scientific establishment in an effort to champion the work of this German scientist. Because the theory was so complex and abstruse (even today it is popularly considered the pinnacle of scientific thinking; in the early years it was even more so), it was rumored that only three people in the world understood it. There was an illuminating, though probably apocryphal, anecdote about this. As related by Ludwik Silberstein,[19] during one of Eddington's lectures he asked \\"Professor Eddington, you must be one of three persons in the world who understands general relativity.\\" Eddington paused, unable to answer. Silberstein continued \\"Don't be modest, Eddington!\\" Finally, Eddington replied \\"On the contrary, I'm trying to think who the third person is.\\"\\r\\nSince the field equations are non-linear, Einstein assumed that they were unsolvable.[citation needed] However, Karl Schwarzschild discovered in 1915 and published in 1916[20] an exact solution for the case of a spherically symmetric spacetime surrounding a massive object in spherical coordinates. This is now known as the Schwarzschild solution. Since then, many other exact solutions have been found.\\r\\nIn 1922, Alexander Friedmann found a solution in which the universe may expand or contract, and later Georges Lema?tre derived a solution for an expanding universe. However, Einstein believed that the universe was apparently static, and since a static cosmology was not supported by the general relativistic field equations, he added a cosmological constant  to the field equations, which became\\r\\nThis permitted the creation of steady-state solutions, but they were unstable: the slightest perturbation of a static state would result in the universe expanding or contracting. In 1929, Edwin Hubble found evidence for the idea that the universe is expanding. This resulted in Einstein dropping the cosmological constant, referring to it as \\"the biggest blunder in my career\\". At the time, it was an ad hoc hypothesis to add in the cosmological constant, as it was only intended to justify one result (a static universe).\\r\\nProgress in solving the field equations and understanding the solutions has been ongoing. The solution for a spherically symmetric charged object was discovered by Reissner and later rediscovered by Nordstr?m, and is called the ReissnerÿNordstr?m solution. The black hole aspect of the Schwarzschild solution was very controversial, and Einstein did not believe that singularities could be real. However, in 1957 (two years after Einstein's death in 1955), Martin Kruskal published a proof that black holes are called for by the Schwarzschild Solution. Additionally, the solution for a rotating massive object was obtained by Kerr in the 1960s and is called the Kerr solution. The KerrÿNewman solution for a rotating, charged massive object was published a few years later.\\r\\nThe perihelion precession of Mercury was the first evidence that general relativity is correct. Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington's 1919 expedition in which he confirmed Einstein's prediction for the deflection of light by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 helped to cement the status of general relativity as a likely true theory. Since then many observations have confirmed the correctness of general relativity. These include studies of binary pulsars, observations of radio signals passing the limb of the Sun, and even the GPS system.\\r\\nGravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, travelling outward from the source. They were first detected in September 2015 by the Advanced LIGO team from the merging of a pair of black holes.[21][22][23]\\r\\nThere have been various attempts to find modifications to general relativity. The most famous of these are the BransÿDicke theory (also known as scalar-tensor theory), and Rosen's bimetric theory. Both of these theories proposed changes to the field equations of general relativity, and both suffer from these changes permitting the presence of bipolar gravitational radiation. As a result, Rosen's original theory has been refuted by observations of binary pulsars. As for BransÿDicke (which has a tunable parameter  such that  =  is the same as general relativity), the amount by which it can differ from general relativity has been severely constrained by these observations.\\r\\nIn addition, general relativity is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the waveÿparticle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There is a great deal of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both general relativity and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.\\r\\nKip Thorne identifies the \\"golden age of general relativity\\" as the period roughly from 1960 to 1975 during which the study of general relativity,[24] which had previously been regarded as something of a curiosity, entered the mainstream of theoretical physics.[citation needed] During this period, many of the concepts and terms which continue to inspire the imagination of gravitation researchers and the general public were introduced, including black holes and 'gravitational singularity'. At the same time, in a closely related development, the study of physical cosmology entered the mainstream and the Big Bang became well established.\\r\\nFulvio Melia refers frequently to the \\"golden age of relativity\\" in his book Cracking the Einstein Code. Andrzej Trautman hosted a relativity conference in Warsaw in 1962 to which Melia refers:\\r\\nRoy Kerr, protagonist of the book, contributed an Afterword, saying of the book: \\"It is a remarkable piece of writing capturing beautifully the period we now refer to as the golden age of relativity.\\"[26]","input":"When was the theory of general relativity published?"},{"output":"end of March 1973","context":"","input":"When did the last american combat troops leave vietnam?"},{"output":"February 28, 1909","context":"International Women's Day (IWD) is celebrated on March 8 every year.[3] It is a focal point in the movement for women's rights.\\r\\nAfter the Socialist Party of America organised a Women's Day on February 28, 1909 in New York, the 1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference suggested a Women's Day be held annually. After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted in 1975 by the United Nations.\\r\\nToday, International Women's Day is a public holiday in some countries and largely ignored elsewhere.[4] In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest Women's Day observance, called \\"National Woman's Day,\\"[5] was held on February 28, 1909 in New York, organized by the Socialist Party of America[6] at the suggestion of Theresa Malkiel.[7] Though there have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on March 8, 1857, researchers have described this as a myth.[8][9][10]\\r\\nIn August 1910, an International Socialist Women's Conference was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark.[11] Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist Luise Zietz proposed the establishment of an annual Women's Day and was seconded by fellow socialist and later communist leader Clara Zetkin, supported by K?te Duncker, although no date was specified at that conference.[12][13] Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including suffrage for women.[14] The following year on March 19, 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.[6] In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations.[12] In Vienna, women paraded on the Ringstrasse and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the Paris Commune.[12] Women demanded that they be given the right to vote and to hold public office. They also protested against employment sex discrimination.[3] The Americans continued to celebrate National Women's Day on the last Sunday in February.[12]\\r\\nIn 1913 Russian women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Saturday in February (by the Julian calendar then used in Russia).[15]\\r\\nIn 1914 International Women's Day was held on March 8, possibly because that day was a Sunday, and now it is always held on March 8 in all countries.[15] The 1914 observance of the Day in Germany was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.[15][16]\\r\\nIn London there was a march from Bow to Trafalgar Square in support of women's suffrage on March 8, 1914. Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of Charing Cross station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.[17]\\r\\nOn March 8, 1917, on the Gregorian calendar, in the capital of the Russian Empire, Petrograd, women textile workers began a demonstration, covering the whole city. This marked the beginning of the Russian Revolution.[18][3] Women in Saint Petersburg went on strike that day for \\"Bread and Peace\\"?ÿ demanding the end of World War I, an end to Russian food shortages, and the end of czarism.[15] Leon Trotsky wrote, \\"23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for support of the strike which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets.\\"[15] Seven days later, the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas II abdicated and the provisional Government granted women the right to vote.[6]\\r\\nFollowing the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontai and Vladimir Lenin made it an official holiday in the Soviet Union, but it was a working day until 1965. On May 8, 1965 by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the USSR \\"in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays.\\"\\r\\nFrom its official adoption in Soviet Russia following the Revolution in 1917, the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922.[12] After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.[19]\\r\\nCommunist leader Dolores Ibrruri led a women's march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the Spanish Civil War.[12]\\r\\nThe United Nations began celebrating International Women's Day in the International Women's Year, 1975. In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the UN Day for women's rights and world peace.[20]\\r\\nOn the occasion of 2010 International Women's Day the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drew attention to the hardships displaced women endure. The displacement of populations is one of the gravest consequences of today's armed conflicts. It affects women in a host of ways.[21]\\r\\nThough the celebration in the West was low-key, events took place in more than 100 countries[4] on March 8, 2011 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day.[22] In the United States, President Barack Obama proclaimed March 2011 to be \\"Women's History Month\\", calling Americans to mark IWD by reflecting on \\"the extraordinary accomplishments of women\\" in shaping the country's history.[4] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched the \\"100 Women Initiative: Empowering Women and Girls through International Exchanges\\", on the eve of IWD.[23] In the run-up to 2011 International Women's Day, the Red Cross called on States and other entities not to relent in their efforts to prevent rape and other forms of sexual violence that harm the lives and dignity of countless women in conflict zones around the world every year.[24]\\r\\nAustralia issued an IWD 100th anniversary commemorative 20-cent coin.\\r\\nIn Egypt, however, the day was a step back for women. In Egypt's Tahrir Square, hundreds of men came out not in support, but to harass the women who came out to stand up for their rights as the police and military stood by watching the events unfold in front of them, doing nothing to stop the crowds of men. \\"The women?ÿ some in headscarves and flowing robes, others in jeans?ÿ had marched to Cairo's central Tahrir Square to celebrate International Women's Day. But crowds of men soon outnumbered them and chased them out\\", wrote Hadeel Al-Shalchi for The Associated Press (AP).[25]\\r\\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2012 was Empower Rural Women?ÿ End Hunger and Poverty.[26] In that year, Oxfam America invited people to celebrate inspiring women in their lives by sending a free International Women's Day e-Card or honoring a woman whose efforts had made a difference in the fight against hunger and poverty with Oxfam's International Women's Day award.[27]\\r\\nOn the occasion of International Women's Day 2012, the ICRC called for more action to help the mothers and wives of people who have gone missing during armed conflict. The vast majority of people who go missing in connection with conflict are men. As well as the anguish of not knowing what has happened to the missing husband or son, many of these women face economic and practical difficulties. The ICRC underlined the duty of parties to a conflict to search for the missing and provide information to the families.[28]\\r\\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2013 was \\"A promise is a promise: Time for action to end violence against women\\",[29] while International Women's Day 2013 declared the year's theme as The Gender Agenda: Gaining Momentum.[30]\\r\\nThe 2013 International Women's Day, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) draw attention to the plight of women in prison.[31]\\r\\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2014 was \\"Equality for Women is Progress for All\\".[32][33]\\r\\nAmerican singer Beyonc also posted an International Women's Day video to her YouTube account. Throughout the video, her song \\"***Flawless\\" plays, which includes a portion of the \\"We Should All Be Feminists\\" speech given by author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Beyonc is a feminist.[34]\\r\\nThe UN theme for International Women's Day 2015 was \\"Empowering Women, Empowering Humanity: Picture it!\\".[35] Governments and activists around the world will commemorate the 20th anniversary year of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, an historic roadmap that sets the agenda for realizing women's rights.[36]\\r\\nThe International Women's Day theme for 2016 was \\"Planet 50-50 by 2030: Step It Up for Gender Equality\\".[37]\\r\\nThe President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, in his message issued on the eve of International Women's Day said: \\"On the occasion of International Womens Day, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to the women of India and thank them for their contributions over the years in the building of our nation.\\"[38] The ministry of women and child development announced the setting up of four more one-stop crisis centers on March 8, in addition to the eight already functioning across the country.[39] Ahead of Women's Day, the national carrier Air India operated what it claimed to be the world's longest non-stop flight where the entire flight operations were handled by women, as part of International Women's Day celebrations. The flight, from Delhi to San Francisco, covered a distance of around 14,500 kilometers in around 17 hours.[40]\\r\\nThe theme for International Women's Day 2017 was \\"Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030\\".[41]\\r\\nIn a message in support of International Women's Day, the UN Secretary-General Ant܇nio Guterres commented on how women's rights were being \\"reduced, restricted and reversed\\". With men still in leadership positions and a widening economic gender gap, he called for change \\"by empowering women at all levels, enabling their voices to be heard and giving them control over their own lives and over the future of our world\\".[42]\\r\\nThe theme for International Women's Day 2018 was'Time is Now: Rural and urban activists transforming womens lives'.[43]\\r\\nThe day is an official holiday in Afghanistan,[44] Angola, Armenia,[45] Azerbaijan,[46][47] Belarus,[48] Burkina Faso,[49] Cambodia,[50] China (for women only),[51] Cuba,[52] Georgia,[53] Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea, Kazakhstan,[54] Kyrgyzstan,[55] Laos,[56] Madagascar (for women only),[57] Moldova,[58] Mongolia,[59] Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine,[60] Uzbekistan,[61] Vietnam,[62] and Zambia.[63]\\r\\nIn some countries, such as Cameroon,[64] Croatia,[65] Romania,[66] Bosnia and Herzegovina,[67] Bulgaria[68] and Chile,[69] the day is not a public holiday, but is widely observed nonetheless. On this day it is customary for men to give the women in their lives?ÿ friends, mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, colleagues, etc.?ÿ flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.[66] In Russia, the day has lost all political context through the time, becoming simply a day to honor women and feminine beauty.[70]\\r\\nIn the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official \\"important day\\" by the Parliament of the Czech Republic in 2004[71] on the proposal of the Social Democrats and Communists. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.[71]\\r\\nInternational Women's Day sparked violence in Tehran, Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. (A previous rally for the occasion was held in Tehran in 2003.)[72] Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation.[73] Shadi Sadr, Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen-day hunger strike.[74]\\r\\nIn Italy, to celebrate the day, men give yellow mimosas to women.[75][76] Communist politician Teresa Mattei chose the mimosa in 1946 as the symbol of IWD in Italy because she felt that the French symbols of the day, violets and lily-of-the-valley, were too scarce and expensive to be used effectively in Italy.[77]\\r\\nIn the United States, actress and human rights activist Beata Pozniak worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the U.S. Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February 1994, H. J. Res. 316 was introduced by Rep. Maxine Waters, along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation.[78]","input":"When was the first international women's day celebrated?"},{"output":"The British Empire","context":"A colonial empire is a collective of territories (often called colonies), mostly overseas, settled by the population of a certain state and governed by that state.\\r\\nColonial empires first emerged with a race of exploration between the then most advanced European maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, during the 15th century.[1] The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the European Renaissance. Agreements were also made to divide the world up between them in 1479, 1493, and 1494. European imperialism was born out of competition between European Christians and Ottoman Muslims, the latter of which rose up quickly in the 14th century and forced the Spanish and Portuguese to seek new trade routes to India, and to a lesser extent, China.\\r\\nAlthough colonies existed in classical antiquity, especially amongst the Phoenicians and the Ancient Greeks who settled many islands and coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, these colonies were politically independent from the city-states they originated from, and thus did not constitute a colonial empire.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPortugal began establishing the first global trade network and empire under the leadership of Henry the Navigator. The empire spread throughout a vast number of territories distributed across the globe (especially at one time in the 16th century) that are now parts of 60 different sovereign states. Portugal would eventually control Brazil, territories such as what is now Uruguay and some fishing ports in north, in the Americas; Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and S?o Tom and Prncipe (among other territories and bases) in the North and the Subsaharan Africa; cities, forts or territories in all the Asian Subcontinents, as Muscat, Ormus and Bahrain (amongst other bases) in the Persian Gulf; Goa, Bombay and Daman and Diu (amongst other coastal cities) in India; Portuguese Ceylon; Malacca, bases in Southeast Asia and Oceania, as Makassar, Solor, Banda, Ambon and others in the Moluccas, Portuguese Timor; and the granted entrep?t-base of Macau and the entrep?t-enclave of Dejima (Nagasaki) in East Asia, amongst other smaller or short-lived possessions.\\r\\nDuring its Siglo de Oro, the Spanish Empire had possession of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Italy, parts of Germany, parts of France, and many colonies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. With the conquest of inland Mexico, Peru, and the Philippines in the 16th century, Spain established overseas dominions on a scale that had never been approached by its predecessors (the Mongol Empire had been larger but was restricted to Eurasia), and with the Iberian Union (1580), reached the widest scale in history until then in world distribution. Possessions in Europe, Africa, the Atlantic Ocean, the Americas, the Pacific Ocean, and East Asia qualified the Spanish Empire as attaining a global presence.\\r\\nFrom 1580 to 1640 the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire were conjoined in a personal union of its Habsburg monarchs during the period of the Iberian Union, but beneath the highest level of government, their separate administrations were maintained.\\r\\nSubsequent colonial empires included the French, English, Dutch and Japanese empires. By the mid-17th century, the Tsardom of Russia, continued later as the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, became the largest contiguous state in the world, and the modern Russian Federation continues to be so to this day. Russia today has nine time zones, stretching across about half of the world's longitude.\\r\\nThe British Empire, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history by virtue of the improved transportation technologies of the time.

Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[28] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,[29] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.\\r\\nThe Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter between 100,000[30] and 180,000 light-years.[31] The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100ÿ400 billion stars.[32][33] There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way.[34][35] The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which is likely to be a supermassive black hole.\\r\\nStars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotation speed contradicts the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much of the mass of the Milky Way does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation. This mass has been termed \\"dark matter\\".[36] The rotational period is about 240 million years at the position of the Sun.[18] The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600?km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.[9]\\r\\nThe Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which is a component of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Milky Way\\" can be seen as a hazy band of white light some 30 degrees wide arcing across the sky.[39] Although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way,[40][41] the light in this band originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane. Dark regions within the band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are areas where light from distant stars is blocked by interstellar dust. The area of the sky obscured by the Milky Way is called the Zone of Avoidance.\\r\\nThe Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for the Milky Way to be seen.[42] It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1.[43] This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon.[nb 2] The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.[44]\\r\\nAs viewed from Earth, the visible region of the Milky Way's Galactic plane occupies an area of the sky that includes 30 constellations.[45] The center of the Galaxy lies in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius; it is here that the Milky Way is brightest. From Sagittarius, the hazy band of white light appears to pass around to the Galactic anticenter in Auriga. The band then continues the rest of the way around the sky, back to Sagittarius. The band divides the night sky into two roughly equal hemispheres.\\r\\nThe Galactic plane is inclined by about 60 degrees to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earths equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to the Galactic plane. The north Galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m, declination +27.4 (B1950) near  Comae Berenices, and the south Galactic pole is near ϫ Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination, depending on the time of night and year, the arc of the Milky Way may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky. For observers from approximately 65 degrees north to 65 degrees south on Earth's surface, the Milky Way passes directly overhead twice a day.\\r\\nThe Milky Way is the second-largest galaxy in the Local Group, with its stellar disk approximately 100,000?ly (30?kpc) in diameter, and, on average, approximately 1,000?ly (0.3?kpc) thick.[4][5] As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way, if the Solar System out to Neptune were the size of a US quarter (24.3?mm (0.955?in)), the Milky Way would be approximately the size of the continental United States.[46] A ring-like filament of stars wrapping around the Milky Way may belong to the Milky Way itself, rippling above and below the relatively flat galactic plane.[31] If so, that would mean a diameter of 150,000ÿ180,000 light-years (46ÿ55?kpc).[47]\\r\\nEstimates of the mass of the Milky Way vary, depending upon the method and data used. At the low end of the estimate range, the mass of the Milky Way is 5.8G1011?solar masses (M?), somewhat less than that of the Andromeda Galaxy.[48][49][50] Measurements using the Very Long Baseline Array in 2009 found velocities as large as 254?km/s (570,000?mph) for stars at the outer edge of the Milky Way.[51] Because the orbital velocity depends on the total mass inside the orbital radius, this suggests that the Milky Way is more massive, roughly equaling the mass of Andromeda Galaxy at 7G1011?M? within 160,000?ly (49?kpc) of its center.[52] In 2010, a measurement of the radial velocity of halo stars found that the mass enclosed within 80 kiloparsecs is 7G1011?M?.[53] According to a study published in 2014, the mass of the entire Milky Way is estimated to be 8.5G1011?M?,[54] which is about half the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy.[54]\\r\\nMuch of the mass of the Milky Way appears to be dark matter, an unknown and invisible form of matter that interacts gravitationally with ordinary matter. A dark matter halo is spread out relatively uniformly to a distance beyond one hundred kiloparsecs from the Galactic Center. Mathematical models of the Milky Way suggest that the mass of dark matter is 1ÿ1.5G1012?M?.[10][11][55] Recent studies indicate a range in mass, as large as 4.5G1012?M? [56] and as small as 8G1011?M?.[57]\\r\\nThe total mass of all the stars in the Milky Way is estimated to be between 4.6G1010?M?[58] and 6.43G1010?M?.[10] In addition to the stars, there is also interstellar gas, comprising 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by mass,[59] with two thirds of the hydrogen found in the atomic form and the remaining one-third as molecular hydrogen.[60] The mass of this gas is equal to between 10%[60] and 15%[59] of the total mass of the galaxy's stars. Interstellar dust accounts for an additional 1% of the total mass of the gas.[59]\\r\\nThe Milky Way contains between 200 and 400?billion stars[61][62] and at least 100?billion planets.[63] The exact figure depends on the number of very-low-mass stars, which are hard to detect, especially at distances of more than 300?ly (90?pc) from the Sun. As a comparison, the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy contains an estimated one trillion (1012) stars.[64] Filling the space between the stars is a disk of gas and dust called the interstellar medium. This disk has at least a comparable extent in radius to the stars,[65] whereas the thickness of the gas layer ranges from hundreds of light years for the colder gas to thousands of light years for warmer gas.[66][67]\\r\\nThe disk of stars in the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge beyond which there are no stars. Rather, the concentration of stars decreases with distance from the center of the Milky Way. For reasons that are not understood, beyond a radius of roughly 40,000 ly (13 kpc) from the center, the number of stars per cubic parsec drops much faster with radius.[68] Surrounding the galactic disk is a spherical Galactic Halo of stars and globular clusters that extends further outward but is limited in size by the orbits of two Milky Way satellites, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, whose closest approach to the Galactic Center is about 180,000?ly (55?kpc).[69] At this distance or beyond, the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the Magellanic Clouds. Hence, such objects would probably be ejected from the vicinity of the Milky Way. The integrated absolute visual magnitude of the Milky Way is estimated to be around ?20.9.[70][71][a]\\r\\nBoth gravitational microlensing and planetary transit observations indicate that there may be at least as many planets bound to stars as there are stars in the Milky Way,[34][72] and microlensing measurements indicate that there are more rogue planets not bound to host stars than there are stars.[73][74] The Milky Way contains at least one planet per star, resulting in 100ÿ400 billion planets, according to a January 2013 study of the five-planet star system Kepler-32 with the Kepler space observatory.[35] A different January 2013 analysis of Kepler data estimated that at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets reside in the Milky Way.[75] On November 4, 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way.[76][77][78] 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars.[79] The nearest such planet may be 4.2 light-years away, according to a 2016 study.[80] Such Earth-sized planets may be more numerous than gas giants.[34] Besides exoplanets, \\"exocomets\\", comets beyond the Solar System, have also been detected and may be common in the Milky Way.[81]\\r\\n360-degree panorama view of the Milky Way (an assembled mosaic of photographs) by ESO. The galactic centre is in the middle of the view, with galactic north up.\\r\\nThe Milky Way consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of gas, dust and stars. The mass distribution within the Milky Way closely resembles the type Sbc in the Hubble classification, which represents spiral galaxies with relatively loosely wound arms.[1] Astronomers began to suspect that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, rather than an ordinary spiral galaxy, in the 1990s.[84] Their suspicions were confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope observations in 2005[85] that showed the Milky Way's central bar to be larger than previously thought.\\r\\nA galactic quadrant, or quadrant of the Milky Way, refers to one of four circular sectors in the division of the Milky Way. In actual astronomical practice, the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the galactic coordinate system, which places the Sun as the origin of the mapping system.[86]\\r\\nQuadrants are described using ordinalsfor example, \\"1st galactic quadrant\\",[87] \\"second galactic quadrant\\",[88] or \\"third quadrant of the Milky Way\\".[89] Viewing from the north galactic pole with 0 degrees () as the ray that runs starting from the Sun and through the Galactic Center, the quadrants are as follows:\\r\\nThe Sun is 25,000ÿ28,000?ly (7.7ÿ8.6?kpc) from the Galactic Center. This value is estimated using geometric-based methods or by measuring selected astronomical objects that serve as standard candles, with different techniques yielding various values within this approximate range.[15][16][17][91][92][93] In the inner few kpc (around 10,000 light-years radius) is a dense concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called the bulge.[94] It has been proposed that the Milky Way lacks a bulge formed due to a collision and merger between previous galaxies, and that instead it has a pseudobulge formed by its central bar.[95]\\r\\nThe Galactic Center is marked by an intense radio source named Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star). The motion of material around the center indicates that Sagittarius A* harbors a massive, compact object.[96] This concentration of mass is best explained as a supermassive black hole[nb 3][15][97] (SMBH) with an estimated mass of 4.1ÿ4.5 million times the mass of the Sun.[97] The rate of accretion of the SMBH is consistent with an inactive galactic nucleus, being estimated at around 6995100000000000000?1G10?5?M??y?1.[98] Observations indicate that there are SMBH located near the center of most normal galaxies.[99][100]\\r\\nThe nature of the Milky Way's bar is actively debated, with estimates for its half-length and orientation spanning from 1?to 5?kpc (3,000ÿ16,000?ly) and 10ÿ50 degrees relative to the line of sight from Earth to the Galactic Center.[92][93][101] Certain authors advocate that the Milky Way features two distinct bars, one nestled within the other.[102] However, RR Lyrae variables do not trace a prominent Galactic bar.[93][103][104] The bar may be surrounded by a ring called the \\"5-kpc ring\\" that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Milky Way, as well as most of the Milky Way's star formation activity. Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy, it would be the brightest feature of the Milky Way.[105] X-ray emission from the core is aligned with the massive stars surrounding the central bar[98] and the Galactic ridge.[106]\\r\\nIn 2010, two gigantic spherical bubbles of high energy emission were detected to the north and the south of the Milky Way core, using data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The diameter of each of the bubbles is about 25,000 light-years (7.7?kpc); they stretch up to Grus and to Virgo on the night-sky of the southern hemisphere.[107][108] Subsequently, observations with the Parkes Telescope at radio frequencies identified polarized emission that is associated with the Fermi bubbles. These observations are best interpreted as a magnetized outflow driven by star formation in the central 640?ly (200?pc) of the Milky Way.[109]\\r\\nLater, on January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*.[83]\\r\\nOutside the gravitational influence of the Galactic bars, the structure of the interstellar medium and stars in the disk of the Milky Way is organized into four spiral arms.[110] Spiral arms typically contain a higher density of interstellar gas and dust than the Galactic average as well as a greater concentration of star formation, as traced by H II regions[111][112] and molecular clouds.[113]\\r\\nThe Milky Way's spiral structure is uncertain, and there is currently no consensus on the nature of the Milky Way's spiral arms.[82] Perfect logarithmic spiral patterns only crudely describe features near the Sun,[112][114] because galaxies commonly have arms that branch, merge, twist unexpectedly, and feature a degree of irregularity.[93][114][115] The possible scenario of the Sun within a spur / Local arm[112] emphasizes that point and indicates that such features are probably not unique, and exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.[114] Estimates of the pitch angle of the arms range from about 7 to 25.[65][116] There are thought to be four spiral arms that all start near the Milky Way's center.[117] These are named as follows, with the positions of the arms shown in the image at right:\\r\\nTwo spiral arms, the ScutumÿCentaurus arm and the CarinaÿSagittarius arm, have tangent points inside the Sun's orbit about the center of the Milky Way. If these arms contain an overdensity of stars compared to the average density of stars in the Galactic disk, it would be detectable by counting the stars near the tangent point. Two surveys of near-infrared light, which is sensitive primarily to red giants and not affected by dust extinction, detected the predicted overabundance in the ScutumÿCentaurus arm but not in the CarinaÿSagittarius arm: the Scutum-Centaurus Arm contains approximately 30% more red giants than would be expected in the absence of a spiral arm.[116][119] This observation suggests that the Milky Way possesses only two major stellar arms: the Perseus arm and the ScutumÿCentaurus arm. The rest of the arms contain excess gas but not excess old stars.[82] In December 2013, astronomers found that the distribution of young stars and star-forming regions matches the four-arm spiral description of the Milky Way.[120][121][122] Thus, the Milky Way appears to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars. The explanation for this apparent discrepancy is unclear.[122]\\r\\nThe Near 3 kpc Arm (also called Expanding 3 kpc Arm or simply 3 kpc Arm) was discovered in the 1950s by astronomer van Woerden and collaborators through 21-centimeter radio measurements of HI (atomic hydrogen).[123][124] It was found to be expanding away from the central bulge at more than 50 km/s. It is located in the fourth galactic quadrant at a distance of about 5.2 kpc from the Sun and 3.3 kpc from the Galactic Center. The Far 3 kpc Arm was discovered in 2008 by astronomer Tom Dame (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA). It is located in the first galactic quadrant at a distance of 3 kpc (about 10,000 ly) from the Galactic Center.[124][125]\\r\\nA simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have obtained its spiral arm structure as a result of repeated collisions with the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.[126]\\r\\nIt has been suggested that the Milky Way contains two different spiral patterns: an inner one, formed by the Sagittarius arm, that rotates fast and an outer one, formed by the Carina and Perseus arms, whose rotation velocity is slower and whose arms are tightly wound. In this scenario, suggested by numerical simulations of the dynamics of the different spiral arms, the outer pattern would form an outer pseudoring,[127] and the two patterns would be connected by the Cygnus arm.[128]\\r\\nOutside of the major spiral arms is the Monoceros Ring (or Outer Ring), a ring of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago. However, several members of the scientific community recently restated their position affirming the Monoceros structure is nothing more than an over-density produced by the flared and warped thick disk of the Milky Way.[129]\\r\\nThe Galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and globular clusters, of which 90% lie within 100,000 light-years (30?kpc) of the Galactic Center.[130] However, a few globular clusters have been found farther, such as PAL 4 and AM1 at more than 200,000 light-years from the Galactic Center. About 40% of the Milky Way's clusters are on retrograde orbits, which means they move in the opposite direction from the Milky Way rotation.[131] The globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about the Milky Way, in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a star.[132]\\r\\nAlthough the disk contains dust that obscures the view in some wavelengths, the halo component does not. Active star formation takes place in the disk (especially in the spiral arms, which represent areas of high density), but does not take place in the halo, as there is little gas cool enough to collapse into stars.[18] Open clusters are also located primarily in the disk.[133]\\r\\nDiscoveries in the early 21st century have added dimension to the knowledge of the Milky Way's structure. With the discovery that the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) extends much further than previously thought,[134] the possibility of the disk of the Milky Way extending further is apparent, and this is supported by evidence from the discovery of the Outer Arm extension of the Cygnus Arm[118][135] and of a similar extension of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm.[136] With the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy came the discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as the polar orbit of the dwarf and its interaction with the Milky Way tears it apart. Similarly, with the discovery of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the Milky Way encircles the Galactic disk.\\r\\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey of the northern sky shows a huge and diffuse structure (spread out across an area around 5,000 times the size of a full moon) within the Milky Way that does not seem to fit within current models. The collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to the plane of the spiral arms of the Milky Way. The proposed likely interpretation is that a dwarf galaxy is merging with the Milky Way. This galaxy is tentatively named the Virgo Stellar Stream and is found in the direction of Virgo about 30,000 light-years (9?kpc) away.[137]\\r\\nIn addition to the stellar halo, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku have provided evidence that there is a gaseous halo with a large amount of hot gas. The halo extends for hundreds of thousand of light years, much further than the stellar halo and close to the distance of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The mass of this hot halo is nearly equivalent to the mass of the Milky Way itself.[138][139][140] The temperature of this halo gas is between 1 and 2.5?million?K (1.8 and 4.5?million?oF).[141]\\r\\nObservations of distant galaxies indicate that the Universe had about one-sixth as much baryonic (ordinary) matter as dark matter when it was just a few billion years old. However, only about half of those baryons are accounted for in the modern Universe based on observations of nearby galaxies like the Milky Way.[142] If the finding that the mass of the halo is comparable to the mass of the Milky Way is confirmed, it could be the identity of the missing baryons around the Milky Way.[142]\\r\\nThe Sun is near the inner rim of the Orion Arm, within the Local Fluff of the Local Bubble, and in the Gould Belt, at a distance of 26.4?I?1.0?kly (8.09?I?0.31?kpc)[15][16][17] from the Galactic Center. The Sun is currently 5ÿ30 parsecs (16ÿ98?ly) from the central plane of the Galactic disk.[143] The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the Perseus Arm, is about 2,000 parsecs (6,500?ly).[144] The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is located in the Milky Way's galactic habitable zone.\\r\\nThere are about 208 stars brighter than absolute magnitude 8.5 within a sphere with a radius of 15 parsecs (49?ly) from the Sun, giving a density of one star per 69 cubic parsecs, or one star per 2,360 cubic light-years (from List of nearest bright stars). On the other hand, there are 64 known stars (of any magnitude, not counting 4 brown dwarfs) within 5 parsecs (16?ly) of the Sun, giving a density of about one star per 8.2 cubic parsecs, or one per 284 cubic light-years (from List of nearest stars). This illustrates the fact that there are far more faint stars than bright stars: in the entire sky, there are about 500 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 4 but 15.5 million stars brighter than apparent magnitude 14.[145]\\r\\nThe apex of the Sun's way, or the solar apex, is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way. The general direction of the Sun's Galactic motion is towards the star Vega near the constellation of Hercules, at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the Galactic Center. The Sun's orbit about the Milky Way is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the Galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions. In addition, the Sun passes through the Galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit.[146] This is very similar to how a simple harmonic oscillator works with no drag force (damping) term. These oscillations were until recently thought to coincide with mass lifeform extinction periods on Earth.[147] However, a reanalysis of the effects of the Sun's transit through the spiral structure based on CO data has failed to find a correlation.[148]\\r\\nIt takes the Solar System about 240 million years to complete one orbit of the Milky Way (a galactic year),[18] so the Sun is thought to have completed 18ÿ20 orbits during its lifetime and 1/1250 of a revolution since the origin of humans. The orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of the Milky Way is approximately 220?km/s (490,000?mph) or 0.073% of the speed of light. The Sun moves through the heliosphere at 84,000?km/h (52,000?mph). At this speed, it takes around 1,400 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light-year, or 8 days to travel 1 AU (astronomical unit).[149] The Solar System is headed in the direction of the zodiacal constellation Scorpius, which follows the ecliptic.[150]\\r\\nThe stars and gas in the Milky Way rotate about its center differentially, meaning that the rotation period varies with location. As is typical for spiral galaxies, the orbital speed of most stars in the Milky Way does not depend strongly on their distance from the center. Away from the central bulge or outer rim, the typical stellar orbital speed is between 210 and 240?km/s (470,000 and 540,000?mph).[153] Hence the orbital period of the typical star is directly proportional only to the length of the path traveled. This is unlike the situation within the Solar System, where two-body gravitational dynamics dominate, and different orbits have significantly different velocities associated with them. The rotation curve (shown in the figure) describes this rotation. Toward the center of the Milky Way the orbit speeds are too low, whereas beyond 7 kpcs the speeds are too high to match what would be expected from the universal law of gravitation.\\r\\nIf the Milky Way contained only the mass observed in stars, gas, and other baryonic (ordinary) matter, the rotation speed would decrease with distance from the center. However, the observed curve is relatively flat, indicating that there is additional mass that cannot be detected directly with electromagnetic radiation. This inconsistency is attributed to dark matter.[36] The rotation curve of the Milky Way agrees with the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies, the best evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies. Alternatively, a minority of astronomers propose that a modification of the law of gravity may explain the observed rotation curve.[154]\\r\\nThe Milky Way began as one or several small overdensities in the mass distribution in the Universe shortly after the Big Bang.[155] Some of these overdensities were the seeds of globular clusters in which the oldest remaining stars in what is now the Milky Way formed. Nearly half the matter in the Milky Way may have come from other distant galaxies.[155] Nonetheless, these stars and clusters now comprise the stellar halo of the Milky Way. Within a few billion years of the birth of the first stars, the mass of the Milky Way was large enough so that it was spinning relatively quickly. Due to conservation of angular momentum, this led the gaseous interstellar medium to collapse from a roughly spheroidal shape to a disk. Therefore, later generations of stars formed in this spiral disk. Most younger stars, including the Sun, are observed to be in the disk.[156][157]\\r\\nSince the first stars began to form, the Milky Way has grown through both galaxy mergers (particularly early in the Milky Way's growth) and accretion of gas directly from the Galactic halo.[157] The Milky Way is currently accreting material from two of its nearest satellite galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, through the Magellanic Stream. Direct accretion of gas is observed in high-velocity clouds like the Smith Cloud.[158][159] However, properties of the Milky Way such as stellar mass, angular momentum, and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has undergone no mergers with large galaxies in the last 10 billion years. This lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies; its neighbour the Andromeda Galaxy appears to have a more typical history shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies.[160][161]\\r\\nAccording to recent studies, the Milky Way as well as the Andromeda Galaxy lie in what in the galaxy colorÿmagnitude diagram is known as the \\"green valley\\", a region populated by galaxies in transition from the \\"blue cloud\\" (galaxies actively forming new stars) to the \\"red sequence\\" (galaxies that lack star formation). Star-formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium. In simulated galaxies with similar properties, star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now, even accounting for the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between both the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.[162] In fact, measurements of other galaxies similar to the Milky Way suggest it is among the reddest and brightest spiral galaxies that are still forming new stars and it is just slightly bluer than the bluest red sequence galaxies.[163]\\r\\nGlobular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way, which thus set a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way. The ages of individual stars in the Milky Way can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long-lived radioactive elements such as thorium-232 and uranium-238, then comparing the results to estimates of their original abundance, a technique called nucleocosmochronology. These yield values of about 12.5 I 3 billion years for CS 31082-001[165] and 13.8 I 4 billion years for BD +17 3248.[166] Once a white dwarf is formed, it begins to undergo radiative cooling and the surface temperature steadily drops. By measuring the temperatures of the coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial temperature, an age estimate can be made. With this technique, the age of the globular cluster M4 was estimated as 12.7 I 0.7 billion years. Age estimates of the oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of 12.6?billion years, and a 95% confidence upper limit of 16?billion years.[167]\\r\\nSeveral individual stars have been found in the Milky Way's halo with measured ages very close to the 13.80-billion-year age of the Universe. In 2007, a star in the galactic halo, HE 1523-0901, was estimated to be about 13.2 billion years old. As the oldest known object in the Milky Way at that time, this measurement placed a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way.[168] This estimate was made using the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope to measure the relative strengths of spectral lines caused by the presence of thorium and other elements created by the R-process. The line strengths yield abundances of different elemental isotopes, from which an estimate of the age of the star can be derived using nucleocosmochronology.[168] Another star, HD 140283, is 14.5 I 0.7 billion years old.[9][169]\\r\\nThe age of stars in the galactic thin disk has also been estimated using nucleocosmochronology. Measurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate that the thin disk formed 8.8 I 1.7 billion years ago. These measurements suggest there was a hiatus of almost 5 billion years between the formation of the galactic halo and the thin disk.[170] Recent analysis of the chemical signatures of thousands of stars suggests that stellar formation might have dropped by an order of magnitude at the time of disk formation, 10 to 8 billion years ago, when interstellar gas was too hot to form new stars at the same rate as before.[171]\\r\\nThe satellite galaxies surrounding the Milky way are not randomly distributed, but seemed to be the result of a break-up of some larger system producing a ring structure 500,000 light years in diameter and 50,000 light years wide.[172] Close encounters between galaxies, like that expected in 4 billion years with the Andromeda Galaxy rips off huge tails of gas, which, over time can coalesce to form dwarf galaxies in a ring at right angles to the main disc.[173]\\r\\nThe Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are a binary system of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the Local Group, surrounded by a Local Void, itself being part of the Virgo Supercluster. Surrounding the Virgo Supercluster are a number of voids, devoid of many galaxies, the Microscopium Void to the \\"north\\", the Sculptor Void to the \\"left\\", the Bootes Void to the \\"right\\" and the Canes-Major Void to the South. These voids change shape over time, creating filamentous structures of galaxies. The Virgo Supercluster, for instance, is being drawn towards the Great Attractor,[174] which in turn forms part of a greater structure, called Laniakea.[175]\\r\\nTwo smaller galaxies and a number of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group orbit the Milky Way. The largest of these is the Large Magellanic Cloud with a diameter of 14,000 light-years. It has a close companion, the Small Magellanic Cloud. The Magellanic Stream is a stream of neutral hydrogen gas extending from these two small galaxies across 100 of the sky. The stream is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal interactions with the Milky Way.[176] Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are Canis Major Dwarf (the closest), Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, Ursa Minor Dwarf, Sculptor Dwarf, Sextans Dwarf, Fornax Dwarf, and Leo I Dwarf. The smallest dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way are only 500 light-years in diameter. These include Carina Dwarf, Draco Dwarf, and Leo II Dwarf. There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically bound to the Milky Way, which is supported by the detection of nine new satellites of the Milky Way in a relatively small patch of the night sky in 2015.[177] There are also some dwarf galaxies that have already been absorbed by the Milky Way, such as Omega Centauri.[178]\\r\\nIn 2014 researchers reported that most satellite galaxies of the Milky Way actually lie in a very large disk and orbit in the same direction.[179] This came as a surprise: according to standard cosmology, the satellite galaxies should form in dark matter halos, and they should be widely distributed and moving in random directions. This discrepancy is still not fully explained.[180]\\r\\nIn January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way, causing vibrations when they pass through its edges. Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way, were considered too small to influence the Milky Way. However, in a computer model, the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake that amplifies their influence on the larger Milky Way.[181]\\r\\nCurrent measurements suggest the Andromeda Galaxy is approaching us at 100 to 140?km/s (220,000 to 310,000?mph). In 3 to 4 billion years, there may be an AndromedaÿMilky Way collision, depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion. If they collide, the chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low, but instead the two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disk galaxy[182] over the course of about a billion years.[183]\\r\\nAlthough special relativity states that there is no \\"preferred\\" inertial frame of reference in space with which to compare the Milky Way, the Milky Way does have a velocity with respect to cosmological frames of reference.\\r\\nOne such frame of reference is the Hubble flow, the apparent motions of galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space. Individual galaxies, including the Milky Way, have peculiar velocities relative to the average flow. Thus, to compare the Milky Way to the Hubble flow, one must consider a volume large enough so that the expansion of the Universe dominates over local, random motions. A large enough volume means that the mean motion of galaxies within this volume is equal to the Hubble flow. Astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 630?km/s (1,400,000?mph) with respect to this local co-moving frame of reference.[184] The Milky Way is moving in the general direction of the Great Attractor and other galaxy clusters, including the Shapley supercluster, behind it.[185] The Local Group (a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing, among others, the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy) is part of a supercluster called the Local Supercluster, centered near the Virgo Cluster: although they are moving away from each other at 967?km/s (2,160,000?mph) as part of the Hubble flow, this velocity is less than would be expected given the 16.8?million pc distance due to the gravitational attraction between the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster.[186]\\r\\nAnother reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The Milky Way is moving at 552?I?6?km/s (1,235,000?I?13,000?mph)[187] with respect to the photons of the CMB, toward 10.5 right ascension, ?24 declination (J2000 epoch, near the center of Hydra). This motion is observed by satellites such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) as a dipole contribution to the CMB, as photons in equilibrium in the CMB frame get blue-shifted in the direction of the motion and red-shifted in the opposite direction.[187]\\r\\nIn Babylonia, the Milky Way was said to be the tail of Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk after he had slain the salt water goddess. It is believed this account, from the Enuma Elish had Marduk replace an earlier Sumerian story when Enlil of Nippur had slain the goddess.\\r\\nLlys D?n (literally \\"The Court of D?n\\") is the traditional Welsh name for the constellation Cassiopeia. At least three of D?n's children also have astronomical associations: Caer Gwydion (\\"The fortress of Gwydion\\") is the traditional Welsh name for the Milky Way, and Caer Arianrhod (\\"The Fortress of Arianrhod\\") being the constellation of Corona Borealis.\\r\\nIn western culture the name \\"Milky Way\\" is derived from its appearance as a dim un-resolved \\"milky\\" glowing band arching across the night sky. The term is a translation of the Classical Latin via lactea, in turn derived from the Hellenistic Greek ϫϫ?ϫ?, short for ϫϫ?ϫ? ?? (galaxas kyklos, \\"milky circle\\"). The Ancient Greek ϫϫ?ϫ? (galaxias) ÿ from root ϫϫٶ-, ?ϫ (\\"milk\\") + -?ϫ? (forming adjectives) ÿ is also the root of \\"galaxy\\", the name for our, and later all such, collections of stars.[25][188][189][190] In Greek mythology it was supposedly made from the forceful suckling of Heracles, when Hera acted as a wetnurse for the hero.\\r\\nThe Milky Way, or \\"milk circle\\", was just one of 11 \\"circles\\" the Greeks identified in the sky, others being the zodiac, the meridian, the horizon, the equator, the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic circles, and two colure circles passing through both poles.[191]\\r\\nIn Meteorologica (DK 59 A80), Aristotle (384ÿ322 BC) wrote that the Greek philosophers Anaxagoras (c.?500ÿ428 BC) and Democritus (460ÿ370 BC) proposed that the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.[192] However, Aristotle himself believed the Milky Way to be caused by \\"the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together\\"[193] and that the \\"ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions.\\"[194][195] The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c.?495ÿ570 A.D.) criticized this view, arguing that if the Milky Way were sublunary, it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it does not. In his view, the Milky Way is celestial. This idea would be influential later in the Islamic world.[196]\\r\\nThe Persian astronomer Ab Rayhn al-Bؐrnؐ (973ÿ1048) proposed that the Milky Way is \\"a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars\\".[197] The Andalusian astronomer Avempace (d 1138) proposed the Milky Way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction in Earth's atmosphere, citing his observation of a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in 1106 or 1107 as evidence.[195] Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292ÿ1350) proposed that the Milky Way is \\"a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars\\" and that these stars are larger than planets.[198]\\r\\nAccording to Jamil Ragep, the Persian astronomer Na?ؐr al-Dؐn al-?sؐ (1201ÿ1274) in his Tadhkira writes: \\"The Milky Way, i.e. the Galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. Because of this, it was likened to milk in color.\\"[199]\\r\\nActual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars.[200][201] In a treatise in 1755, Immanuel Kant, drawing on earlier work by Thomas Wright,[202] speculated (correctly) that the Milky Way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars, held together by gravitational forces akin to the Solar System but on much larger scales.[203] The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate \\"galaxies\\" themselves, similar to our own. Kant referred to both the Milky Way and the \\"extragalactic nebulae\\" as \\"island universes\\", a term still current up to the 1930s.[204][205][206]\\r\\nThe first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun within it was carried out by William Herschel in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the visible sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the Milky Way with the Solar System close to the center.[207]\\r\\nIn 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.[208]\\r\\nIn 1917, Heber Curtis had observed the nova S Andromedae within the Great Andromeda Nebula (Messier object 31). Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more novae. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within the Milky Way. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the \\"island universes\\" hypothesis, which held that the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.[209] In 1920 the Great Debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.[210]\\r\\nThe controversy was conclusively settled by Edwin Hubble in the early 1920s using the Mount Wilson observatory 2.5?m (100?in) Hooker telescope. With the light-gathering power of this new telescope, he was able to produce astronomical photographs that resolved the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars. He was also able to identify some Cepheid variables that he could use as a benchmark to estimate the distance to the nebulae. He found that the Andromeda Nebula is 275,000 parsecs from the Sun, far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.[211][212]\\r\\nThe ESA spacecraft Gaia provides distance estimates by determining the parallax of a billion stars and is mapping the Milky Way with four planned releases of maps in 2022.[213][214]","input":"How many stars in the milky way nasa?"},{"output":"the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate","context":"Corrosion is a natural process, which converts a refined metal to a more chemically-stable form, such as its oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide. It is the gradual destruction of materials (usually metals) by chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment.  Corrosion engineering is the field dedicated to controlling and stopping corrosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the most common use of the word, this means electrochemical oxidation of metal in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen or sulfur. Rusting, the formation of iron oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion. This type of damage typically produces oxide(s) or salt(s) of the original metal, and results in a distinctive orange colouration. Corrosion can also occur in materials other than metals, such as ceramics or polymers, although in this context, the term \\"degradation\\" is more common. Corrosion degrades the useful properties of materials and structures including strength, appearance and permeability to liquids and gases.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany structural alloys corrode merely from exposure to moisture in air, but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a wide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface. Because corrosion is a diffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces. As a result, methods to reduce the activity of the exposed surface, such as passivation and chromate conversion, can increase a material's corrosion resistance. However, some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a galvanic couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series. For example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. Galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nFactors such as relative size of anode, types of metal, and operating conditions (temperature, humidity, salinity, etc.) affect galvanic corrosion. The surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials. Galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any given environment (one standard medium is aerated, room-temperature seawater), one metal will be either more noble or more active than others, based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface. Two metals in electrical contact share the same electrons, so that the \\"tug-of-war\\" at each surface is analogous to competition for free electrons between the two materials. Using the electrolyte as a host for the flow of ions in the same direction, the noble metal will take electrons from the active one. The resulting in mass flow or electric current can be measured to establish a hierarchy of materials in the medium of interest. This hierarchy is called a galvanic series and is useful in predicting and understanding corrosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion. For example, phosphoric acid in the form of naval jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust. Corrosion removal should not be confused with electropolishing, which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface. For example, phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper, not the products of copper corrosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome metals are more intrinsically resistant to corrosion than others (for some examples, see galvanic series). There are various ways of protecting metals from corrosion (oxidation) including painting, hot dip galvanizing, and combinations of these.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamically unfavorable. Any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal, which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on Earth and have long been valued. More common \\"base\\" metals  can only be protected by more temporary means.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome metals have naturally slow reaction kinetics, even though their corrosion is thermodynamically favorable. These include such metals as zinc, magnesium, and cadmium. While corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing, it happens at an acceptably slow rate. An extreme example is graphite, which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation, but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of corrosion products, known as a passive film, on the metal's surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation. The chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal. Typical passive film thickness on aluminium, stainless steels, and alloys is within 10 nanometers. The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range ÿ the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not. Passivation in natural environments such as air, water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such materials as aluminium, stainless steel, titanium, and silicon.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassivation is primarily determined by metallurgical and environmental factors. The effect of pH is summarized using Pourbaix diagrams, but many other factors are influential. Some conditions that inhibit passivation include high pH for aluminium and zinc, low pH or the presence of chloride ions for stainless steel, high temperature for titanium (in which case the oxide dissolves into the metal, rather than the electrolyte) and fluoride ions for silicon. On the other hand, unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are normally unprotected, as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel rebar. Exposure to a liquid metal such as mercury or hot solder can often circumvent passivation mechanisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassivation is extremely useful in mitigating corrosion damage, however even a high-quality alloy will corrode if its ability to form a passivating film is hindered.  Proper selection of the right grade of material for the specific environment is important for the long-lasting performance of this group of materials.  If breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors, the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain conditions, such as low concentrations of oxygen or high concentrations of species such as chloride which complete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy's ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, almost all of the surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys,[citation needed] but it can be prevented by control of the alloy's environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nPitting results when a small hole, or cavity, forms in the metal, usually as a result of de-passivation of a small area. This area becomes anodic, while part of the remaining metal becomes cathodic, producing a localized galvanic reaction. The deterioration of this small area penetrates the metal and can lead to failure. This form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion-produced compounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nStainless steel can pose special corrosion challenges, since its passivating behavior relies on the presence of a major alloying component (chromium, at least 11.5%). Because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment, chromium carbides can form in the grain boundaries of stainless alloys. This chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary, making those areas much less resistant to corrosion. This creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby, which leads to \\"weld decay\\" (corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones) in highly corrosive environments. This process can seriously reduce the mechanical strength of welded joints over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stainless steel is said to be \\"sensitized\\" if chromium carbides are formed in the microstructure. A typical microstructure of a normalized type 304 stainless steel shows no signs of sensitization, while a heavily sensitized steel shows the presence of grain boundary precipitates. The dark lines in the sensitized microstructure are networks of chromium carbides formed along the grain boundaries.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial alloys, either with low carbon content or with added carbon \\"getters\\" such as titanium and niobium (in types 321 and 347, respectively), can prevent this effect, but the latter require special heat treatment after welding to prevent the similar phenomenon of \\"knifeline attack\\". As its name implies, corrosion is limited to a very narrow zone adjacent to the weld, often only a few micrometers across, making it even less noticeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces (crevices), to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited. Formation of a differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts, under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled with deposits and under sludge piles.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrevice corrosion is influenced by the crevice type (metal-metal, metal-nonmetal), crevice geometry (size, surface finish), and metallurgical and environmental factors. The susceptibility to crevice corrosion can be evaluated with ASTM standard procedures. A critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a material's resistance to crevice corrosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrobial corrosion, or commonly known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and non-metallic materials, in the presence or absence of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen sulfide, causing sulfide stress cracking. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion. Concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products, leading to localized corrosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccelerated low-water corrosion (ALWC) is a particularly aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile.[5] Piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed at the time of construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed. Affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection, using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh-temperature corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material (typically a metal) as a result of heating. This non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen, sulfur, or other compounds capable of oxidizing (or assisting the oxidation of) the material concerned. For example, materials used in aerospace, power generation and even in car engines have to resist sustained periods at high temperature in which they may be exposed to an atmosphere containing potentially highly corrosive products of combustion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe products of high-temperature corrosion can potentially be turned to the advantage of the engineer. The formation of oxides on stainless steels, for example, can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack, allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high temperatures in hostile conditions. Such high-temperature corrosion products, in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes, prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature sliding contact of metallic (or metallic and ceramic) surfaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities, such as synthesis gas and other high-CO environments. The corrosion manifests itself as a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder. The suspected mechanism is firstly the deposition of a graphite layer on the surface of the metal, usually from carbon monoxide (CO) in the vapor phase. This graphite layer is then thought to form metastable M3C species (where M is the metal), which migrate away from the metal surface. However, in some regimes no M3C species is observed indicating a direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious treatments are used to slow corrosion damage to metallic objects which are exposed to the weather, salt water, acids, or other hostile environments. Some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to corrosion, such as those used in neodymium magnets, which can spall or crumble into powder even in dry, temperature-stable indoor environments unless properly treated to discourage corrosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen surface treatments are used to retard corrosion, great care must be taken to ensure complete coverage, without gaps, cracks, or pinhole defects. Small defects can act as an \\"Achilles' heel\\", allowing corrosion to penetrate the interior and causing extensive damage even while the outer protective layer remains apparently intact for a period of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlating, painting, and the application of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or cadmium.\\r\\n\\r\\nPainting either by roller or brush is more desirable for tight spaces; spray would be better for larger coating areas such as steel decks and waterfront applications. Flexible polyurethane coatings, like Durabak-M26 for example, can provide an anti-corrosive seal with a highly durable slip resistant membrane. Painted coatings are relatively easy to apply and have fast drying times although temperature and humidity may cause dry times to vary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the environment is controlled (especially in recirculating systems), corrosion inhibitors can often be added to it. These chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts in hard water (Roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits), chromates, phosphates, polyaniline, other conducting polymers and a wide range of specially-designed chemicals that resemble surfactants (i.e. long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).\\r\\n\\r\\nAluminium alloys often undergo a surface treatment. Electrochemical conditions in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers wide, appear in the metal's oxide film. These pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than passivating conditions would allow. At the end of the treatment, the pores are allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface layer. If this coating is scratched, normal passivation processes take over to protect the damaged area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnodizing is very resilient to weathering and corrosion, so it is commonly used for building facades and other areas where the surface will come into regular contact with the elements. While being resilient, it must be cleaned frequently. If left without cleaning, panel edge staining will naturally occur. Anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a more active anode in contact with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new form of protection has been developed by applying certain species of bacterial films to the surface of metals in highly corrosive environments. This process increases the corrosion resistance substantially. Alternatively, antimicrobial-producing biofilms can be used to inhibit mild steel corrosion from sulfate-reducing bacteria.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nControlled permeability formwork (CPF) is a method of preventing the corrosion of reinforcement by naturally enhancing the durability of the cover during concrete placement. CPF has been used in environments to combat the effects of carbonation, chlorides, frost and abrasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nCathodic protection (CP) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell. Cathodic protection systems are most commonly used to protect steel, and pipelines and tanks; steel pier piles, ships, and offshore oil platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor effective CP, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more negative until the metal surface has a uniform potential. With a uniform potential, the driving force for the corrosion reaction is halted. For galvanic CP systems, the anode material corrodes under the influence of the steel, and eventually it must be replaced. The polarization is caused by the current flow from the anode to the cathode, driven by the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor larger structures, galvanic anodes cannot economically deliver enough current to provide complete protection. Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems use anodes connected to a DC power source (such as a cathodic protection rectifier). Anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes of various specialized materials. These include high silicon cast iron, graphite, mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnodic protection impresses anodic current on the structure to be protected (opposite to the cathodic protection). It is appropriate for metals that exhibit passivity (e.g. stainless steel) and suitably small passive current over a wide range of potentials. It is used in aggressive environments, such as solutions of sulfuric acid.\\r\\n\\r\\nA simple test for measuring corrosion is the weight loss method.[7] The method involves exposing a clean weighed piece of the metal or alloy to the corrosive environment for a specified time followed by cleaning to remove corrosion products and weighing the piece to determine the loss of weight. The rate of corrosion (R) is calculated as\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere k is a constant,\\r\\nW is the weight loss of the metal in time t, A is the surface area of the metal exposed, and  is the density of the metal (in g/cm3).\\r\\n\\r\\nOther common expressions for the corrosion rate is penetration depth and change of mechanical properties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, the US Federal Highway Administration released a study titled \\"Corrosion Costs and Preventive Strategies in the United States\\" on the direct costs associated with metallic corrosion in the US industry. In 1998, the total annual direct cost of corrosion in the U.S. was ca. $276 billion (ca. 3.2% of the US gross domestic product).[8] Broken down into five specific industries, the economic losses are $22.6 billion in infrastructure; $17.6 billion in production and manufacturing; $29.7 billion in transportation; $20.1 billion in government; and $47.9 billion in utilities.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nRust is one of the most common causes of bridge accidents. As rust has a much higher volume than the originating mass of iron, its build-up can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts. It was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus river bridge in 1983, when the bearings rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support. Three drivers on the roadway at the time died as the slab fell into the river below. The following NTSB investigation showed that a drain in the road had been blocked for road re-surfacing, and had not been unblocked; as a result, runoff water penetrated the support hangers. Rust was also an important factor in the Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia, when a steel suspension bridge collapsed within a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, corrosion of concrete-covered steel and iron can cause the concrete to spall, creating severe structural problems. It is one of the most common failure modes of reinforced concrete bridges. Measuring instruments based on the half-cell potential can detect the potential corrosion spots before total failure of the concrete structure is reached.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 20ÿ30 years ago, galvanized steel pipe was used extensively in the potable water systems for single and multi-family residents as well as commercial and public construction. Today, these systems have long ago consumed the protective zinc and are corroding internally resulting in poor water quality and pipe failures.[10]  The economic impact on homeowners, condo dwellers, and the public infrastructure is estimated at 22 billion dollars as the insurance industry braces for a wave of claims due to pipe failures.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost ceramic materials are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical energy in the structure; they can be thought of as already corroded. When corrosion does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of corrosion protection in ceramics is the lime added to soda-lime glass to reduce its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium silicate, normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture. Due to its brittleness, such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolymer degradation involves several complex and often poorly understood physiochemical processes. These are strikingly different from the other processes discussed here, and so the term \\"corrosion\\" is only applied to them in a loose sense of the word. Because of their large molecular weight, very little entropy can be gained by mixing a given mass of polymer with another substance, making them generally quite difficult to dissolve. While dissolution is a problem in some polymer applications, it is relatively simple to design against.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more common and related problem is \\"swelling\\", where small molecules infiltrate the structure, reducing strength and stiffness and causing a volume change. Conversely, many polymers (notably flexible vinyl) are intentionally swelled with plasticizers, which can be leached out of the structure, causing brittleness or other undesirable changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common form of degradation, however, is a decrease in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and can be as simple as a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass is characterized by a high degree of corrosion-resistance. Because of its high water-resistance it is often used as primary packaging material in the pharma industry since most medicines are preserved in a watery solution.[11] Besides its water-resistance, glass is also very robust when being exposed to chemically aggressive liquids or gases. While other materials like metal or plastics quickly reach their limits, special glass-types can easily hold up.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass disease is the corrosion of silicate glasses in aqueous solutions. It is governed by two mechanisms: diffusion-controlled leaching (ion exchange) and hydrolytic dissolution of the glass network.[12] Both mechanisms strongly depend on the pH of contacting solution: the rate of ion exchange decreases with pH as 10?0.5pH whereas the rate of hydrolytic dissolution increases with pH as 100.5pH.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nMathematically, corrosion rates of glasses are characterized by normalized corrosion rates of elements NRi (g/cm2{d) which are determined as the ratio of total amount of released species into the water Mi (g) to the water-contacting surface area S (cm2), time of contact t (days) and weight fraction content of the element in the glass fi:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall corrosion rate is a sum of contributions from both mechanisms (leaching + dissolution) NRi=NRxi+NRh.\\r\\nDiffusion-controlled leaching (ion exchange) is characteristic of the initial phase of corrosion and involves replacement of alkali ions in the glass by a hydronium (H3O+) ion from the solution. It causes an ion-selective depletion of near surface layers of glasses and gives an inverse square root dependence of corrosion rate with exposure time. The diffusion-controlled normalized leaching rate of cations from glasses (g/cm2{d) is given by:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere t is time, Di is the i-th cation effective diffusion coefficient (cm2/d), which depends on pH of contacting water as Di = Di0{10ÿpH, and  is the density of the glass (g/cm3).\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass network dissolution is characteristic of the later phases of corrosion and causes a congruent release of ions into the water solution at a time-independent rate in dilute solutions (g/cm2{d):\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere rh is the stationary hydrolysis (dissolution) rate of the glass (cm/d). \\r\\nIn closed systems the consumption of protons from the aqueous phase increases the pH and causes a fast transition to hydrolysis.[14] However, a further saturation of solution with silica impedes hydrolysis and causes the glass to return to an ion-exchange, e.g. diffusion-controlled regime of corrosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn typical natural conditions normalized corrosion rates of silicate glasses are very low and are of the order of 10?7ÿ10?5 g/(cm2{d). The very high durability of silicate glasses in water makes them suitable for hazardous and nuclear waste immobilisation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere exist numerous standardized procedures for measuring the corrosion (also called chemical durability) of glasses in neutral, basic, and acidic environments, under simulated environmental conditions, in simulated body fluid, at high temperature and pressure,[16] and under other conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard procedure ISO 719[17] describes a test of the extraction of water-soluble basic compounds under neutral conditions: 2 g of glass, particle size 300ÿ500 m, is kept for 60 min in 50 ml de-ionized water of grade 2 at 98?C; 25 ml of the obtained solution is titrated against 0.01?mol/l HCl solution. The volume of HCl required for neutralization is classified according to the table below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standardized test ISO 719 is not suitable for glasses with poor or not extractable alkaline components, but which are still attacked by water, e.g. quartz glass, B2O3 glass or P2O5 glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsual glasses are differentiated into the following classes:\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrolytic class 1 (Type I):\\r\\n\\r\\nThis class, which is also called neutral glass, includes borosilicate glasses (e.g. Duran, Pyrex, Fiolax).\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass of this class contains essential quantities of boron oxides, aluminium oxides and alkaline earth oxides. Through its composition neutral glass has a high resistance against temperature shocks and the highest hydrolytic resistance. Against acid and neutral solutions it shows high chemical resistance, because of its poor alkali content against alkaline solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrolytic class 2 (Type II):\\r\\n\\r\\nThis class usually contains sodium silicate glasses with a high hydrolytic resistance through surface finishing. Sodium silicate glass is a silicate glass, which contains alkali- and alkaline earth oxide and primarily sodium oxide and Calcium oxide.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrolytic class 3 (Type III):\\r\\n\\r\\nGlass of the 3rd hydrolytic class usually contains sodium silicate glasses and has a mean hydrolytic resistance, which is two times poorer than of type 1 glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcid class DIN 12116 and alkali class DIN 52322 (ISO 695) are to be distinguished from the hydrolytic class DIN 12111 (ISO 719).","input":"Why does corrosion usually occur at an anode?"},{"output":"Cornelius","context":"Cornelius (Greek: ??) was a Roman centurion who is considered by Christians to be one of the first Gentiles to convert to the faith, as related in Acts of the Apostles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCornelius was a centurion in the Cohors II Italica Civium Romanorum, mentioned as Cohors Italica in the Vulgate.[2][3] He was stationed in Caesarea, the capital of Roman Iudaea province.[4] He is depicted in the New Testament as a God-fearing man who always prayed and was full of good works and deeds of alms. Cornelius receives a vision in which an angel of God tells him that his prayers have been heard, he understands that he's chosen for a higher alternative. The angel then instructs Cornelius to send the men of his household to Joppa, where they will find Simon Peter, who is residing with a tanner by the name of Simon (Acts 10:5ff).\\r\\nThe conversion of Cornelius comes after a separate vision given to Simon Peter (Acts 10:10ÿ16) himself. In the vision, Simon Peter sees all manner of beasts and fowl being lowered from Heaven in a sheet. A voice commands Simon Peter to eat. When he objects to eating those animals that are unclean according to Mosaic Law, the voice tells him not to call unclean that which God has cleansed.[5]\\r\\nWhen Cornelius' men arrive, Simon Peter understands that through this vision the Lord commanded the Apostle to preach the Word of God to the Gentiles. Peter accompanies Cornelius' men back to Caesarea.[5] When Cornelius meets Simon Peter, he falls at Peter's feet. Simon Peter raises the centurion and the two men share their visions. Simon Peter tells of Jesus' ministry and the Resurrection; the Holy Spirit descends on everyone at the gathering. The Jews among the group (presumably they were all Jews if Cornelius was the first gentile convert, see Jewish Christians) are amazed that Cornelius and other uncircumcised should begin speaking in tongues, praising God. Thereupon Simon Peter commands that Cornelius and his followers be baptized.[6] The controversial aspect of Gentile conversion is taken up later at the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15), but has its roots in the concept of \\"proselytes\\" in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) and Jewish Noahide Law.[citation needed]\\r\\nPeter later chose not to eat with Gentiles in Antioch after some Jews criticized him. The apostle Paul publicly confronted Peter for being hypocritical as related in Galatians 2.[citation needed]\\r\\nCornelius was one of the first Gentiles converted to Christianity.[8]\\r\\nThe baptism of Cornelius is an important event in the history of the early Christian church, along with the conversion and baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch. The Christian church was first formed around the original disciples and followers of Jesus, all of whom were Jewish. All males in that community were circumcised and observed the Law of Moses. The reception of Cornelius sparked a conversation among the Jewish leaders of the new Christian church, culminating in the decision to allow Gentiles to become Christians without conforming to Jewish requirements for circumcision, as recounted in Acts 15(Acts 15).\\r\\nCertain traditions hold Cornelius as becoming either the first bishop of Caesarea or the bishop of Scepsis in Mysia.[4][6]\\r\\nHis feast day on the General Roman Calendar is 2 February. He is commemorated in the Orthodox tradition on 13 September.[5]\\r\\nCornelius is honored with a commemoration in the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on February 7.[9] When Governor's Island, New York, was a military installation the Episcopal Church maintained a stone chapel there dedicated to him.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Greek-French philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis is named after him.[10]\\r\\nChapel exterior\\r\\nThree military saints in the reredos (Cornelius on the right)\\r\\nStained glass window based on Acts 10","input":"Who was the first roman to be baptized?"},{"output":"Australia","context":"Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids.[1] Wool mainly consists of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out.[2]\\r\\nWool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific heat coefficient, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.\\r\\nFelting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation as the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together.\\r\\nWool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped and elastic.[3]\\r\\nThe amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers. A fine wool like Merino may have up to 100 crimps per inch, while coarser wool like karakul may have as few as one or two. In contrast, hair has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp. The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed cloth of Scotland.\\r\\nWool fibers readily absorb moisture, but are not hollow. Wool can absorb almost one-third of its own weight in water.[4] Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics. It is generally a creamy white color, although some breeds of sheep produce natural colors, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes.\\r\\nWool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibers. It has a lower rate of flame spread, a lower rate of heat release, a lower heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip;[5] it forms a char which is insulating and self-extinguishing, and it contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than other flooring products when used in carpets.[6] Wool carpets are specified for high safety environments, such as trains and aircraft. Wool is usually specified for garments for firefighters, soldiers, and others in occupations where they are exposed to the likelihood of fire.[6]\\r\\nWool is considered by the medical profession to be allergenic.[7]\\r\\nSheep shearing is the process by which the woolen fleece of a sheep is cut off. After shearing, the wool is separated into four main categories: fleece (which makes up the vast bulk), broken, bellies, and locks. The quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person called a wool classer groups wools of similar gradings together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner. In Australia before being auctioned, all Merino fleece wool is objectively measured for micron, yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes color and comfort factor.\\r\\nWool straight off a sheep, known as \\"greasy wool\\"[8] or \\"wool in the grease\\", contains a high level of valuable lanolin, as well as the sheep's dead skin and sweat residue, and generally also contains pesticides and vegetable matter from the animal's environment. Before the wool can be used for commercial purposes, it must be scoured, a process of cleaning the greasy wool. Scouring may be as simple as a bath in warm water or as complicated as an industrial process using detergent and alkali in specialized equipment.[9] In north west England, special potash pits were constructed to produce potash used in the manufacture of a soft soap for scouring locally produced white wool.\\r\\nIn commercial wool, vegetable matter is often removed by chemical carbonization.[citation needed][10] In less-processed wools, vegetable matter may be removed by hand and some of the lanolin left intact through the use of gentler detergents. This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly water-resistant mittens or sweaters, such as those of the Aran Island fishermen. Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products such as hand creams.\\r\\nRaw wool has many impurities; vegetable matter, sand, dirt and yolk which is a mixture of suint (sweat), grease, urine stains and dung locks. The sheeps body yields many types of wool, with differing strengths, thicknesses, length of staple and impurities. The raw wool (greasy) is processed into 'top'. 'Worsted top' requires strong straight and parallel fibres.\\r\\nThe quality of wool is determined by its fiber diameter, crimp, yield, color, and staple strength. Fiber diameter is the single most important wool characteristic determining quality and price.\\r\\nMerino wool is typically 3ÿ5?inches in length and is very fine (between 12 and 24 microns).[12] The finest and most valuable wool comes from Merino hoggets. Wool taken from sheep produced for meat is typically more coarse, and has fibers 1.5 to 6?in (38 to 152?mm) in length. Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.[13]\\r\\nWool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the wool's diameter in microns and also its style. These grades may vary depending on the breed or purpose of the wool. For example:\\r\\nAny wool finer than 25 microns can be used for garments, while coarser grades are used for outerwear or rugs. The finer the wool, the softer it is, while coarser grades are more durable and less prone to pilling.\\r\\nThe finest Australian and New Zealand Merino wools are known as 1PP, which is the industry benchmark of excellence for Merino wool 16.9 microns and finer. This style represents the top level of fineness, character, color, and style as determined on the basis of a series of parameters in accordance with the original dictates of British wool as applied by the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) Council. Only a few dozen of the millions of bales auctioned every year can be classified and marked 1PP.[15]\\r\\nIn the United States, three classifications of wool are named in the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939.[16] \\"Wool\\" is \\"the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the so-called specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product\\".[16] \\"Virgin wool\\" and \\"new wool\\" are also used to refer to such never used wool. There are two categories of recycled wool (also called reclaimed or shoddy wool). \\"Reprocessed wool\\" identifies \\"wool which has been woven or felted into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been used by the ultimate consumer\\".[16] \\"Reused wool\\" refers to such wool that has been used by the ultimate consumer.[16]\\r\\nWild sheep were more hairy than woolly. Although sheep were domesticated some 9,000 to 11,000 years ago, archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in Iran suggests selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000?BC,[17][18] with the earliest woven wool garments having only been dated to two to three thousand years later.[19] Woolly-sheep were introduced into Europe from the Near East in the early part of the 4th millennium BC. The oldest known European wool textile, ca. 1500 BC, was preserved in a Danish bog.[20] Prior to invention of shearsprobably in the Iron Agethe wool was plucked out by hand or by bronze combs. In Roman times, wool, linen, and leather clothed the European population; cotton from India was a curiosity of which only naturalists had heard, and silks, imported along the Silk Road from China, were extravagant luxury goods. Pliny the Elder records in his Natural History that the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by Tarentum, where selective breeding had produced sheep with superior fleeces, but which required special care.\\r\\nIn medieval times, as trade connections expanded, the Champagne fairs revolved around the production of wool cloth in small centers such as Provins. The network developed by the annual fairs meant the woolens of Provins might find their way to Naples, Sicily, Cyprus, Majorca, Spain, and even Constantinople.[21] The wool trade developed into serious business, a generator of capital.[22] In the 13th century, the wool trade became the economic engine of the Low Countries and central Italy. By the end of the 14th century, Italy predominated, though Italian production turned to silk in the 16th century.[21] Both industries, based on the export of English raw wool, were rivaled only by the 15th-century sheepwalks of Castile and were a significant source of income to the English crown, which in 1275 had imposed an export tax on wool called the \\"Great Custom\\". The importance of wool to the English economy can be seen in the fact that since the 14th century, the presiding officer of the House of Lords has sat on the \\"Woolsack\\", a chair stuffed with wool.\\r\\nEconomies of scale were instituted in the Cistercian houses, which had accumulated great tracts of land during the 12th and early 13th centuries, when land prices were low and labor still scarce. Raw wool was baled and shipped from North Sea ports to the textile cities of Flanders, notably Ypres and Ghent, where it was dyed and worked up as cloth. At the time of the Black Death, English textile industries accounted for about 10% of English wool production. The English textile trade grew during the 15th century, to the point where export of wool was discouraged. Over the centuries, various British laws controlled the wool trade or required the use of wool even in burials. The smuggling of wool out of the country, known as owling, was at one time punishable by the cutting off of a hand. After the Restoration, fine English woolens began to compete with silks in the international market, partly aided by the Navigation Acts; in 1699, the English crown forbade its American colonies to trade wool with anyone but England herself.\\r\\nA great deal of the value of woolen textiles was in the dyeing and finishing of the woven product. In each of the centers of the textile trade, the manufacturing process came to be subdivided into a collection of trades, overseen by an entrepreneur in a system called by the English the \\"putting-out\\" system, or \\"cottage industry\\", and the Verlagssystem by the Germans. In this system of producing wool cloth, once perpetuated in the production of Harris tweeds, the entrepreneur provides the raw materials and an advance, the remainder being paid upon delivery of the product. Written contracts bound the artisans to specified terms. Fernand Braudel traces the appearance of the system in the 13th-century economic boom, quoting a document of 1275.[21] The system effectively bypassed the guilds' restrictions.\\r\\nBefore the flowering of the Renaissance, the Medici and other great banking houses of Florence had built their wealth and banking system on their textile industry based on wool, overseen by the Arte della Lana, the wool guild: wool textile interests guided Florentine policies. Francesco Datini, the \\"merchant of Prato\\", established in 1383 an Arte della Lana for that small Tuscan city. The sheepwalks of Castile shaped the landscape and the fortunes of the meseta that lies in the heart of the Iberian peninsula; in the 16th century, a unified Spain allowed export of Merino lambs only with royal permission. The German wool market ÿ based on sheep of Spanish origin ÿ did not overtake British wool until comparatively late. The Industrial Revolution introduced mass production technology into wool and wool cloth manufacturing. Australia's colonial economy was based on sheep raising, and the Australian wool trade eventually overtook that of the Germans by 1845, furnishing wool for Bradford, which developed as the heart of industrialized woolens production.\\r\\nDue to decreasing demand with increased use of synthetic fibers, wool production is much less than what it was in the past. The collapse in the price of wool began in late 1966 with a 40% drop; with occasional interruptions, the price has tended down. The result has been sharply reduced production and movement of resources into production of other commodities, in the case of sheep growers, to production of meat.[23][24][25]\\r\\nSuperwash wool (or washable wool) technology first appeared in the early 1970s to produce wool that has been specially treated so it is machine washable and may be tumble-dried. This wool is produced using an acid bath that removes the \\"scales\\" from the fiber, or by coating the fiber with a polymer that prevents the scales from attaching to each other and causing shrinkage. This process results in a fiber that holds longevity and durability over synthetic materials, while retaining its shape.[26]\\r\\nIn December 2004, a bale of the then world's finest wool, averaging 11.8 microns, sold for AU$3,000 per kilogram at auction in Melbourne, Victoria. This fleece wool tested with an average yield of 74.5%, 68?mm long, and had 40 newtons per kilotex strength. The result was A$279,000 for the bale.[27] The finest bale of wool ever auctioned was sold for a seasonal record of AU$2690 per kilo during June 2008. This bale was produced by the Hillcreston Pinehill Partnership and measured 11.6 microns, 72.1% yield, and had a 43 newtons per kilotex strength measurement. The bale realized $247,480 and was exported to India.[28]\\r\\nIn 2007, a new wool suit was developed and sold in Japan that can be washed in the shower, and which dries off ready to wear within hours with no ironing required. The suit was developed using Australian Merino wool, and it enables woven products made from wool, such as suits, trousers, and skirts, to be cleaned using a domestic shower at home.[29]\\r\\nIn December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so as to raise the profile of wool and other natural fibers.\\r\\nGlobal wool production is about 2 million tonnes per year, of which 60% goes into apparel. Wool comprises ca 3% of the global textile market, but its value is higher owing to dying and other modifications of the material.[1] Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total weight.[30] New Zealand (2016) is the third-largest producer of wool, and the largest producer of crossbred wool. Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.\\r\\nIn the United States, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado have large commercial sheep flocks and their mainstay is the Rambouillet (or French Merino). Also, a thriving home-flock contingent of small-scale farmers raise small hobby flocks of specialty sheep for the hand-spinning market. These small-scale farmers offer a wide selection of fleece. Global woolclip (total amount of wool shorn) 2004/2005[31]\\r\\nOrganic wool is becoming more and more popular. This wool is very limited in supply and much of it comes from New Zealand and Australia.[32] It is becoming easier to find in clothing and other products, but these products often carry a higher price. Wool is environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-based nylon or polypropylene) as a material for carpets, as well, in particular when combined with a natural binding and the use of formaldehyde-free glues.\\r\\nAnimal rights groups have noted issues with the production of wool, such as mulesing.\\r\\nAbout 85% of wool sold in Australia is sold by open cry auction.[citation needed] \\"Sale by sample\\" is a method in which a mechanical claw takes a sample from each bale in a line or lot of wool. These grab samples are bulked, objectively measured, and a sample of not less than 4?kg is displayed in a box for the buyer to examine. The Australian Wool Exchange conducts sales primarily in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Fremantle. About 80 brokers and agents work throughout Australia.[citation needed]\\r\\nAbout 7% of Australian wool is sold by private treaty on farms or to local wool-handling facilities. This option gives wool growers benefit from reduced transport, warehousing, and selling costs. This method is preferred for small lots or mixed butts to make savings on reclassing and testing.\\r\\nAbout 5% of Australian wool is sold over the internet on an electronic offer board.[citation needed] This option gives wool growers the ability to set firm price targets, reoffer passed-in wool, and offer lots to the market quickly and efficiently. This method works well for tested lots, as buyers use these results to make a purchase. About 97% of wool is sold without sample inspection; however, as of December 2009, 59% of wool listed had been passed in from auction.[citation needed] Growers through certain brokers can allocate their wool to a sale and at what price their wool will be reserved.\\r\\nSale by tender can achieve considerable cost savings on wool clips large enough to make it worthwhile for potential buyers to submit tenders. Some marketing firms sell wool on a consignment basis, obtaining a fixed percentage as commission.\\r\\nForward selling: Some buyers offer a secure price for forward delivery of wool based on estimated measurements or the results of previous clips. Prices are quoted at current market rates and are locked in for the season. Premiums and discounts are added to cover variations in micron, yield, tensile strength, etc., which are confirmed by actual test results when available.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother method of selling wool includes sales direct to wool mills.\\r\\nThe British Wool Marketing Board operates a central marketing system for UK fleece wool with the aim of achieving the best possible net returns for farmers.\\r\\nLess than half of New Zealand's wool is sold at auction, while around 45% of farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users.[33]\\r\\nUnited States sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative wool warehouses, but wool pools are common in many states. In some cases, wool is pooled in a local market area, but sold through a wool warehouse. Wool offered with objective measurement test results is preferred. Imported apparel wool and carpet wool goes directly to central markets, where it is handled by the large merchants and manufacturers.[34]\\r\\nShoddy or recycled wool is made by cutting or tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting fibers.[35] As this process makes the wool fibers shorter, the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original. The recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool, wool noil, or another fiber such as cotton to increase the average fiber length. Such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp. This process was invented in the Heavy Woollen District of West Yorkshire and created a microeconomy in this area for many years.\\r\\nRag is a sturdy wool fiber made into yarn and used in many rugged applications such as gloves.\\r\\nWorsted is a strong, long-staple, combed wool yarn with a hard surface.[35]\\r\\nWoolen is a soft, short-staple, carded wool yarn typically used for knitting.[35] In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.[36]\\r\\nIn addition to clothing, wool has been used for blankets, horse rugs, saddle cloths, carpeting, insulation and upholstery. Wool felt covers piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers. Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt.\\r\\nWool has also been traditionally used to cover cloth diapers.[citation needed] Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of the wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.\\r\\nInitial studies of woolen underwear have found it prevented heat and sweat rashes because it more readily absorbs the moisture than other fibers.[37]\\r\\nMerino wool has been used in baby sleep products such as swaddle baby wrap blankets and infant sleeping bags.\\r\\nAs an animal protein, wool can be used as a soil fertilizer, being a slow-release source of nitrogen.\\r\\nResearchers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology school of fashion and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and Kevlar, the synthetic fiber widely used in body armor, was lighter, cheaper and worked better in damp conditions than Kevlar alone. Kevlar, when used alone, loses about 20% of its effectiveness when wet, so required an expensive waterproofing process. Wool increased friction in a vest with 28ÿ30 layers of fabric, to provide the same level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of Kevlar alone.[38]\\r\\nA buyer of Merino wool, Ermenegildo Zegna, has offered awards for Australian wool producers. In 1963, the first Ermenegildo Zegna Perpetual Trophy was presented in Tasmania for growers of \\"Superfine skirted Merino fleece\\". In 1980, a national award, the Ermenegildo Zegna Trophy for Extrafine Wool Production, was launched. In 2004, this award became known as the Ermenegildo Zegna Unprotected Wool Trophy. In 1998, an Ermenegildo Zegna Protected Wool Trophy was launched for fleece from sheep coated for around nine months of the year.\\r\\nIn 2002, the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy was launched for wool that is 13.9 microns or finer. Wool from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa may enter, and a winner is named from each country.[39] In April 2008, New Zealand won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy for the first time with a fleece that measured 10.8 microns. This contest awards the winning fleece weight with the same weight in gold as a prize, hence the name.\\r\\nIn 2010, an ultrafine, 10-micron fleece, from Windradeen, near Pyramul, New South Wales, won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum International Trophy.[40]\\r\\nSince 2000, Loro Piana has awarded a cup for the world's finest bale of wool that produces just enough fabric for 50 tailor-made suits. The prize is awarded to an Australian or New Zealand wool grower who produces the year's finest bale.[41]\\r\\nThe New England Merino Field days which display local studs, wool, and sheep are held during January, in even numbered years around the Walcha, New South Wales district. The Annual Wool Fashion Awards, which showcase the use of Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by the city of Armidale, New South Wales, in March each year. This event encourages young and established fashion designers to display their talents. During each May, Armidale hosts the annual New England Wool Expo to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations, shearing competitions, yard dog trials, and more.[1]\\r\\nIn July, the annual Australian Sheep and Wool Show is held in Bendigo, Victoria. This is the largest sheep and wool show in the world, with goats and alpacas, as well as woolcraft competitions and displays, fleece competitions, sheepdog trials, shearing, and wool handling. The largest competition in the world for objectively measured fleeces is the Australian Fleece Competition, which is held annually at Bendigo. In 2008, 475 entries came from all states of Australia, with first and second prizes going to the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales fleeces.[42]","input":"Who produces the most wool in the world?"},{"output":"35 to 40","context":"Full-time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his/her employer. Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sickleave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 35 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits.\\r\\nFull-Time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week. The \\"standard\\" work week consists of five eight-hour days, commonly served between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM or 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM totaling 40 hours. While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days; it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36-hour work week. Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime. Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week. The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half. The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts. Shifts can also be very irregular, as in retail, but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached. There are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time, which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFull-time workweeks:\\r\\nA person working more than full-time is working overtime, and may be entitled to extra per-hour wages (but not salary).\\r\\nFull-time can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes a full load of course work each academic term. The distinction between a full-time and part-time student varies markedly from country to country. As an example, in the United States a student is commonly defined as being in full-time education when they undertake 12 or more credit hours. This translates to 12 \\"hours\\" (often of 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes each) in class per week. \\"Lab hours\\" often count for less, only as one-half or one-third of a credit hour.\\r\\nInternational students must maintain full-time status for student visas.[13] Adult students (typically up to age 22 or 23) may also fall under their parents' health insurance (and possibly car insurance and other services) if they are full-time, except for one term per year (usually summer). Students may also be eligible for elected office in student government or other student organizations only if they are full-time. The Department of Labor has a full-time student program which allows employers to pay no less than 85% of the minimum wage to the student/employee.[14]","input":"How many hours for a full time job?"},{"output":"more than 60 languages","context":"The Diary of a Young Girl, also known as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor, just after the war was over. The diary has since been published in more than 60 languages.\\r\\nFirst published under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 ÿ 1 Augustus 1944 (The Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 ÿ 1 August 1944) by Contact Publishing in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Doubleday & Company (United States) and Valentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play The Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the screen for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\\r\\nThe copyright of the Dutch version of the diary, published in 1947, expired on 1 January 2016, 70 years after the author's death as a result of a general rule in copyright law of the European Union. Following this, the original Dutch version was made available online.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Anne Frank received a blank diary as one of her presents on June 12, 1942, her 13th birthday.[8][9] According to the Anne Frank House, the red, checkered autograph book which Anne used as her diary was actually not a surprise, since she had chosen it the day before with her father when browsing a bookstore near her home.[9] She began to write in it on June 14, 1942, two days later.[10][11]\\r\\nOn July 5, 1942, Anne's older sister Margot received an official summons to report to a Nazi work camp in Germany, and on July 6, Margot and Anne went into hiding with their father Otto and mother Edith. They were joined by Hermann van Pels, Otto's business partner, including his wife Auguste and their teenage son Peter.[12] Their hiding place was in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex at the back of Otto's company building in Amsterdam.[12][13] Otto Frank started his business, named Opekta, in 1933. He was licensed to manufacture and sell pectin, a substance used to make jam. He stopped running his business while everybody was in hiding. But once he returned, he found his employees running it. The rooms that everyone hid in were concealed behind a movable bookcase in the same building as Opekta. Mrs. van Pels's dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: The van Pelses are known as the Van Daans, and Fritz Pfeffer as Albert Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month.\\r\\nIn August 1944, they were discovered and deported to Nazi concentration camps. They were long thought to have been betrayed, although there are indications that their discovery may have been accidental, that the police raid had actually targeted \\"ration fraud\\".[14] Of the eight people, only Otto Frank, the oldest, survived the war. Anne died when she was 15 years old in Bergen-Belsen, from typhus. The exact date of her death is unknown, and has long been believed to be in early March, a few weeks before the prisoners were liberated by British troops in April 1945. However, new research in 2015 indicated that Anne may have died in February.[15]\\r\\nIn manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between June 14 and December 5, 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on December 22, 1943, and ends on April 17, 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost - presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from April 17 to August 1, 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time before her arrest.[16]:2\\r\\nThe manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest,[17] but before their rooms were ransacked by the Dutch police and the Gestapo. They were kept safe, and given to Otto Frank after the war, with the original notes, when Anne's death was confirmed in the autumn of 1945.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe diary is not written in the classic forms of \\"Dear Diary\\" or as letters to oneself; Anne calls her diary \\"Kitty\\", so almost all of the letters are written to Kitty. Anne used the above-mentioned names for her annex-mates in the first volume, from September 25, 1942 until November 13, 1942, when the first notebook ends.[18] It is believed that these names were taken from characters found in a series of popular Dutch books written by Cissy van Marxveldt.[18]\\r\\nAnne's already budding literary ambitions were galvanized on 29 March 1944 when she heard a London radio broadcast made by the exiled Dutch Minister for Education, Art, and Science, Gerrit Bolkestein,[17] calling for the preservation of \\"ordinary documentsa diary, letters ... simple everyday material\\" to create an archive for posterity as testimony to the suffering of civilians during the Nazi occupation. On May 20, 1944, she notes that she started re-drafting her diary with future readers in mind.[19] She expanded entries and standardized them by addressing all of them to Kitty, clarified situations, prepared a list of pseudonyms, and cut scenes she thought would be of little interest or too intimate for general consumption. By the time she started the second existing volume, she was writing only to Kitty.\\r\\nThere has been much conjecture about the identity or inspiration of Kitty, who in Anne's revised manuscript is the sole recipient of her letters. In 1996, the critic Sietse van der Hoek wrote that the name referred to Kitty Egyedi, a prewar friend of Anne's. Van der Hoek may have been informed by the publication A Tribute to Anne Frank (1970), prepared by the Anne Frank Foundation, which assumed a factual basis for the character in its preface by the then-chairman of the Foundation, Henri van Praag, and accentuated this with the inclusion of a group photograph that singles out Anne, Sanne Ledermann, Hanneli Goslar, and Kitty Egyedi. Anne does not mention Kitty Egyedi in any of her writings (in fact, the only other girl mentioned in her diary from the often reproduced photo, other than Goslar and Ledermann, is Mary Bos, whose drawings Anne dreamed about in 1944) and the only comparable example of Anne's writing unposted letters to a real friend are two farewell letters to Jacqueline van Maarsen, from September 1942.[20]\\r\\nTheodor Holman wrote in reply to Sietse van der Hoek that the diary entry for 28 September 1942 proved conclusively the character's fictional origin.[citation needed] Jacqueline van Maarsen agreed,[citation needed] but Otto Frank assumed his daughter had her real acquaintance in mind when she wrote to someone of the same name.[citation needed] However, Kitty Egyedi said in an interview that she was flattered by the assumption, but doubted the diary was addressed to her:\\r\\nAnne had expressed the desire in the rewritten introduction of her diary for one person that she could call her truest friend, that is, a person to whom she could confide her deepest thoughts and feelings. She observed that she had many \\"friends\\" and equally many admirers, but (by her own definition) no true, dear friend with whom she could share her innermost thoughts. She originally thought her girl friend Jacque van Maarsen would be this person, but that was only partially successful. In an early diary passage, she remarks that she is not in love with Helmut \\"Hello\\" Silberberg, her suitor at that time, but considered that he might become a true friend. In hiding, she invested much time and effort into her budding romance with Peter van Pels, thinking he might evolve into that one, true friend, but that was eventually a disappointment to her in some ways, also, though she still cared for him very much. Ultimately, it was only to Kitty that she entrusted her innermost thoughts.\\r\\nIn her diary, Anne wrote of her very close relationship with her father, lack of daughterly love for her mother (with whom she felt she had nothing in common), and admiration for her sister's intelligence and sweet nature. She did not like the others much initially, particularly Auguste van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer (the latter shared her room). She was at first unimpressed by the quiet Peter; she herself was something of a self-admitted chatterbox (a source of irritation to some of the others). As time went on, however, she and Peter became very close, though she remained uncertain in what direction their relationship would develop.\\r\\nThere are two versions of the diary written by Anne Frank. She wrote the first version in a designated diary and two notebooks (version A), but rewrote it (version B) in 1944 after hearing on the radio that war-time diaries were to be collected to document the war period. Version B was written on loose paper, and is not identical to Version A, as parts were added and others omitted.[22]\\r\\nThe first transcription of Anne's diary was in German, made by Otto Frank for his friends and relatives in Switzerland, who convinced him to send it for publication.[23] The second, a composition of Anne Frank's versions A and B as well as excerpts from her essays became the first draft submitted for publication, with an epilogue written by a family friend explaining the fate of its author. In the spring of 1946, it came to the attention of Dr. Jan Romein and his wife Annie Romein-Verschoor, two Dutch historians. They were so moved by it that Anne Romein made unsuccessful attempts to find a publisher, which led Romein to write an article for the newspaper Het Parool:[24]\\r\\nThis caught the interest of Contact Publishing in Amsterdam, who approached Otto Frank to submit a Dutch draft of the manuscript for their consideration. They offered to publish, but advised Otto Frank that Anne's candor about her emerging sexuality might offend certain conservative quarters, and suggested cuts. Further entries were also deleted. The diary ÿ which was a combination of version A and version B ÿ was published under the name Het Achterhuis. Dagbrieven van 14 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944 (The Secret Annex. Diary Letters from June 14, 1942 to August 1, 1944) on June 25, 1947.[24] Otto Frank later discussed this moment, \\"If she had been here, Anne would have been so proud.\\"[24] The book sold well; the 3000 copies of the first edition were soon sold out, and in 1950 a sixth edition was published.\\r\\nIn 1986, a critical edition appeared, incorporating versions A and B, and based on the findings of the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation into challenges to the diary's authenticity. This was published in three volumes with a total of 714 pages.[25]\\r\\nIn 1950, the Dutch translator Rosey E. Pool made a first translation of the Diary, which was never published.[26] At the end of 1950, another translator was found to produce an English-language version. Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday was contracted by Vallentine, Mitchell & Co. in England, and by the end of the following year, her translation was submitted, now including the deleted passages at Otto Frank's request. As well, Judith Jones, while working for the publisher Doubleday, read and recommended the Diary, pulling it out of the rejection pile.[27] Jones recalled that she came across Frank's work in a slush pile of material that had been rejected by other publishers; she was struck by a photograph of the girl on the cover of an advance copy of the French edition. \\"I read it all day\\", she noted. \\"When my boss returned, I told him, 'We have to publish this book.' He said, 'What? That book by that kid?'\\" She brought the diary to the attention of Doubleday's New York office. \\"I made the book quite important because I was so taken with it, and I felt it would have a real market in America. It's one of those seminal books that will never be forgotten\\", Jones said.[28] The book appeared in the U.S. and Great Britain in 1952, becoming a best-seller. The introduction of the English publication was written by Eleanor Roosevelt.\\r\\nIn 1989, an English edition of this appeared under the title of The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition, including Mooyaart-Doubleday's translation and Anne Frank's versions A and B, based on Dutch critical version of 1986.[29][30] A new translation by Susan Massotty based on the original texts was published in 1995.\\r\\nThe work was translated in 1950 in German and French, before it appeared in 1952 in the US in English.[31] The critical version was also translated into Chinese.[32] As of 2015, the website of the Anne Frank Fonds records translations in over 60 languages.[33]\\r\\nA play by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich based on the diary won the Pulitzer Prize for 1955, and a subsequent movie earned Shelley Winters an Academy Award for her performance, whereupon Winters donated her Oscar to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.[34]\\r\\nThe first major new adaptation of the diary for the stage was 2014's ANNE at the purpose-built Theater Amsterdam in the Netherlands. As this production was authorised and initiated by the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel, ANNE is the first adaptation of the diary allowed to quote literal passages from it. After a two-year continuous run in the Netherlands, the play has had productions in Germany[35] and Israel.\\r\\nOther adaptations of the diary include a version by Wendy Kesselman from 1997,[36] and a 2014 adaptation by playwright Alix Sobler, The Secret Annex, which imagined the fate of the diary if Anne Frank had escaped the Holocaust.[37] The first German film version of the diary, written by Fred Breinersdorfer, was released by NBCUniversal in 2016. The film is derived from the 2014 Dutch stage production.\\r\\nIn May 2018, Frank van Vree, the director of the Niod Institute along with others, discovered some unseen excerpts from the diary that Anne had previously covered up with a piece of brown paper. The excerpts discuss sexuality, prostitution, and also include jokes Anne herself described as \\"dirty\\" that she heard from the other residents of the Secret Annex and elsewhere. Van Vree said \\"anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile\\", before adding, \\"the 'dirty' jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all an ordinary girl\\". [38]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, Otto Frank recalled his feelings when reading the diary for the first time, \\"For me, it was a revelation. There, was revealed a completely different Anne to the child that I had lost. I had no idea of the depths of her thoughts and feelings.\\"[23] Michael Berenbaum, former director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, wrote, \\"Precocious in style and insight, it traces her emotional growth amid adversity. In it, she wrote, 'In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.'\\"[23]\\r\\nIt was reported around the world that in February 2014, 265 copies of the Frank diary and other material related to the Holocaust were found to be vandalized in 31 public libraries in Tokyo, Japan.[39][40] The Simon Wiesenthal Center expressed \\"its shock and deep concern\\"[41] and, in response, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called the vandalism \\"shameful.\\" Israel donated 300 copies of Anne Frank's diary to replace the vandalized copies.[42] An anonymous donor under the name of 'Chiune Sugihara' donated two boxes of books pertaining to the Holocaust to the Tokyo central library.[43] After media attention had subsided, police arrested an unemployed man in March.[44] In June, prosecutors decided not to indict the suspect after he was found to be mentally incompetent.[45] Tokyo librarians have reported that Nazi-related books such as the diary and Man's Search for Meaning attract people with mental disorder and are subject to occasional vandalism.[46][better?source?needed]\\r\\nIn 2009, the armed group Hezbollah called to ban the book in Lebanese schools, arguing that the text was an apology to Jews, Zionism and the State of Israel.[47]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Culpeper County, Virginia school system banned the 50th Anniversary \\"Definitive Edition\\" of Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, due to \\"complaints about its sexual content and homosexual themes.\\"[48] This version \\"includes passages previously excluded from the widely read original edition.... Some of the extra passages detail her emerging sexual desires; others include unflattering descriptions of her mother and other people living together.\\"[49] After consideration, it was decided a copy of the newer version would remain in the library and classes would revert to using the older version.\\r\\nIn 2013, a similar controversy arose in a 7th grade setting in Northville, Michigan, focusing on explicit passages about sexuality.[50] The mother behind the formal complaint referred to portions of the book as \\"pretty pornographic.\\"[51]\\r\\nThe American Library Association stated that there have been six challenges to the book in the United States since it started keeping records on bans and challenges in 1990, and \\"Most of the concerns were about sexually explicit material\\".[49]\\r\\nAs reported in The New York Times in 2015, \\"When Otto Frank first published his daughter's red-checked diary and notebooks, he wrote a prologue assuring readers that the book mostly contained her words\\".[52] Although many Holocaust deniers, such as Robert Faurisson, have claimed that Anne Frank's diary was fabricated,[53][54] critical and forensic studies of the text and the original manuscript have supported its authenticity.[55]\\r\\nThe Netherlands Institute for War Documentation commissioned a forensic study of the manuscripts after the death of Otto Frank in 1980. The material composition of the original notebooks and ink, and the handwriting found within them and the loose version were extensively examined. In 1986, the results were published: The handwriting attributed to Anne Frank was positively matched with contemporary samples of Anne Frank's handwriting, and the paper, ink, and glue found in the diaries and loose papers were consistent with materials available in Amsterdam during the period in which the diary was written.[55]\\r\\nThe survey of her manuscripts compared an unabridged transcription of Anne Frank's original notebooks with the entries she expanded and clarified on loose paper in a rewritten form and the final edit as it was prepared for the English translation. The investigation revealed that all of the entries in the published version were accurate transcriptions of manuscript entries in Anne Frank's handwriting, and that they represented approximately a third of the material collected for the initial publication. The magnitude of edits to the text is comparable to other historical diaries such as those of Katherine Mansfield, Ana?s Nin and Leo Tolstoy in that the authors revised their diaries after the initial draft, and the material was posthumously edited into a publishable manuscript by their respective executors, only to be superseded in later decades by unexpurgated editions prepared by scholars.[56]\\r\\nIn his will, Otto Frank bequeathed the original manuscripts to the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation. The copyright however belongs to the Anne Frank Fonds, a Switzerland-based foundation of Basel which was the sole inheritor of Frank after his death in 1980.\\r\\nAccording to the copyright laws in the European Union, as a general rule, rights of authors end seventy years after their death. Hence, the copyright of the diary expired on 1 January 2016. In the Netherlands, for the original publication of 1947 (containing parts of both versions of Anne Frank's writing), as well as a version published in 1986 (containing both versions completely), copyright initially would have expired not 50 years after the death of Anne Frank (1996), but 50 years after publication, as a result of a provision specific for posthumously published works (1997 and 2036, respectively).\\r\\nWhen the copyright duration was extended to 70 years in 1995 ÿ implementing the EU Copyright Term Directive ÿ the special rule regarding posthumous works was abolished, but transitional provisions made sure that this could never lead to shortening of the copyright term, thus leading to expiration of the copyright term for the first version on 1 January 2016, but for the new material published in 1986 in 2036.[7][22]\\r\\nThe original Dutch version was made available free online by University of Nantes lecturer Olivier Ertzscheid and French parliament member Isabelle Attard.[57]\\r\\nIn 2015, the Anne Frank Fonds made an announcement, as reported in The New York Times, that the diary was co-authored by Otto Frank. According to Yves Kugelmann, a member of the board of the foundation, their expert advice was that Otto had created a new work by editing, merging, and trimming entries from the diary and notebooks and reshaping them into a \\"kind of collage\\", which had created a new copyright. Agns Tricoire, a lawyer specializing in intellectual property rights, responded by warning the foundation to \\"think very carefully about the consequences\\". She added \\"If you follow their arguments, it means that they have lied for years about the fact that it was only written by Anne Frank.\\"[52]\\r\\nThe foundation also relies on the fact that another editor, Mirjam Pressler, had revised the text and added 25 percent more material drawn from the diary for a \\"definitive edition\\" in 1991, and Pressler was still alive in 2015, thus creating another long-lasting new copyright.[52] The move was seen as an attempt to extend the copyright term. Attard had criticised this action only as a \\"question of money\\",[57] and Ertzscheid concurred, stating, \\"It [the diary] belongs to everyone. And it is up to each to measure its importance.\\"[58]","input":"How many languages anne frank's diary is published in?"},{"output":"Michigan State","context":"The 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament involved 40 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I college basketball.

It has, however, been played in a team's regular off-campus home arena two times since then: in 1985 at Rupp Arena, Kentucky's home court, and in 1996 at Continental Airlines Arena, then Seton Hall's home court.

This is the first tournament since 1994 in which no games were played in an NFL stadium, as the Alamodome is a college football stadium, although the Alamodome hosted some home games for the New Orleans Saints during their 2005 season. The 2018 tournament featured three new arenas in previous host cities. Philips Arena, the home of the Atlanta Hawks and replacement for the previously used Omni Coliseum, hosted the South regional games, and the new Little Caesars Arena, home of the Detroit Pistons and Detroit Red Wings, hosted games. And for the first time since 1994, the tournament returned to Wichita and the state of Kansas where Intrust Bank Arena hosted first round games.\\r\\nThe state of North Carolina was threatened with a 2018-2022 championship venue boycott by the NCAA, due to the HB2 law passed in 2016.[4] However, the law was repealed (but with provisos) days before the NCAA met to make decisions on venues in April 2017. At that time, the NCAA board of governors \\"reluctantly voted to allow consideration of championship bids in North Carolina by our committees that are presently meeting\\".[5] Therefore, Charlotte was eligible and served as a first weekend venue for the 2018 tournament.\\r\\nFour teams, out of 351 in Division I, were ineligible to participate in the 2018 tournament due to failing to meet APR requirements: Alabama A&M, Grambling State, Savannah State, and Southeast Missouri State.[6] However, the NCAA granted the Savannah State Tigers a waiver which would have allowed the team to participate in the tournament, but the team failed to qualify.\\r\\nThe following 32 teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2018 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's automatic bid.[7]\\r\\nThe tournament seeds were determined through the NCAA basketball tournament selection process. The seeds and regions were determined as follows:[8]\\r\\n*See First Four\\r\\nThe 2018 tournament was the first time since the 1978 tournament that the six Division I college basketball-playing schools based in the Washington, DC metropolitan area ÿ American, Georgetown, George Mason, George Washington, Howard, and Maryland ÿ were collectively shut out of the NCAA Tournament.[9]\\r\\nAll times are listed as Eastern Daylight Time (UTC?4)\\r\\n* ÿ Denotes overtime period\\r\\nDuring the Final Four round, regardless of the seeds of the participating teams, the champion of the top overall top seed's region (Virginia's South Region) plays against the champion of the fourth-ranked top seed's region (Xavier's West Region), and the champion of the second overall top seed's region (Villanova's East Region) plays against the champion of the third-ranked top seed's region (Kansas's Midwest Region).\\r\\nThe Pac-12 lost all of its teams after the first day of the main tournament draw, marking the first time since the Big 12 began play in 1996 that one of the six major conferencesdefined as the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC, and both versions of the Big Eastfailed to have a team advance to the tournament's round of 32.[15]\\r\\nCBS Sports and Turner Sports had U.S. television rights to the Tournament under the NCAA March Madness brand. As part of a cycle beginning in 2016, TBS held the rights to the Final Four and to the championship game.[16] Additionally, TBS held the rights to the 2018 Selection Show, which returned to a two-hour format, was presented in front of a studio audience, and promoted that the entire field of the tournament would be unveiled within the first ten minutes of the broadcast.[17] The broadcast was heavily criticized for its quality (including technical problems and an embedded product placement segment for Pizza Hut), as well as initially unveiling the 68-team field in alphabetical order (beginning with automatic qualifiers, followed by the at-large teams) rather than unveiling the matchups region-by-region (which was criticized for having less suspense than the traditional format).[18][19][20]\\r\\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the entire tournament.\\r\\nLive video of games was available for streaming through the following means:[21]\\r\\nLive audio of games was available for streaming through the following means:","input":"What teams are in the final four ncaa basketball tournament?"},{"output":"12 nautical miles","context":"Territorial waters or a territorial sea, as defined by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,[1] is a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles (22.2?km; 13.8?mi) from the baseline (usually the mean low-water mark) of a coastal state. The territorial sea is regarded as the sovereign territory of the state, although foreign ships (civilian) are allowed innocent passage through it, or transit passage for straits; this sovereignty also extends to the airspace over and seabed below. Adjustment of these boundaries is called, in international law, maritime delimitation.\\r\\nThe term \\"territorial waters\\" is also sometimes used informally to refer to any area of water over which a state has jurisdiction, including internal waters, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and potentially the continental shelf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNormally, the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal state. This is either the low-water mark closest to the shore, or alternatively it may be an unlimited distance from permanently exposed land, provided that some portion of elevations exposed at low tide but covered at high tide (like mud flats) is within 12 nautical miles (22?km; 14?mi) of permanently exposed land. Straight baselines can alternatively be defined connecting fringing islands along a coast, across the mouths of rivers, or with certain restrictions across the mouths of bays. In this case, a bay is defined as \\"a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation\\". The baseline across the bay must also be no more than 24 nautical miles (44?km; 28?mi) in length.\\r\\nWaters landward of the baseline are defined as internal waters, over which the state has complete sovereignty: not even innocent passage is allowed. Lakes and rivers are considered internal waters. All \\"archipelagic waters\\" within the outermost islands of an archipelagic state such as Indonesia or the Philippines are also considered internal waters, and are treated the same with the exception that innocent passage through them must be allowed. However, archipelagic states may designate certain sea lanes through these waters.\\r\\nA state's territorial sea extends up to 12 nautical miles (22.2?km; 13.8?mi) from its baseline. If this would overlap with another state's territorial sea, the border is taken as the median point between the states' baselines, unless the states in question agree otherwise. A state can also choose to claim a smaller territorial sea.\\r\\nConflicts still occur whenever a coastal nation claims an entire gulf as its territorial waters while other nations only recognize the more restrictive definitions of the UN convention. Two recent conflicts occurred in the Gulf of Sidra where Libya has claimed the entire gulf as its territorial waters and the U.S. has enforced freedom of navigation rights twice, in the 1981 and 1989 Gulf of Sidra incidents.\\r\\nIn the U.S. federal system, individual states exercise ownership (subject to federal law) up to 3 nautical miles (9 nautical miles for Texas and Florida) from shore, while the federal government exercises sole territorial jurisdiction further out (see Tidelands).\\r\\nThe contiguous zone is a band of water extending from the outer edge of the territorial sea to up to 24 nautical miles (44.4?km; 27.6?mi) from the baseline, within which a state can exert limited control for the purpose of preventing or punishing \\"infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea\\". This will typically be 12 nautical miles (22?km; 14?mi) wide, but could be more (if a state has chosen to claim a territorial sea of less than 12 nautical miles), or less, if it would otherwise overlap another state's contiguous zone. However, unlike the territorial sea, there is no standard rule for resolving such conflicts and the states in question must negotiate their own compromise. The United States invoked a contiguous zone out to 24 nmi on 29 September 1999.[2]\\r\\nAn exclusive economic zone extends from the outer limit of the territorial sea to a maximum of 200 nautical miles (370.4?km; 230.2?mi) from the territorial sea baseline, thus it includes the contiguous zone.[3] A coastal nation has control of all economic resources within its exclusive economic zone, including fishing, mining, oil exploration, and any pollution of those resources. However, it cannot prohibit passage or loitering above, on, or under the surface of the sea that is in compliance with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of the UN Convention, within that portion of its exclusive economic zone beyond its territorial sea. Before the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, coastal nations arbitrarily extended their territorial waters in an effort to control activities which are now regulated by the exclusive economic zone, such as offshore oil exploration or fishing rights (see Cod Wars). Indeed, the exclusive economic zone is still popularly, though erroneously, called a coastal nation's territorial waters.\\r\\nArticle 79[4] gives the legal definition of continental shelf of coastal countries. For the physical geography definition, see the continental shelf page.\\r\\nThe continental shelf of a coastal nation extends out to the outer edge of the continental margin but at least 200 nautical miles (370?km; 230?mi) from the baselines of the territorial sea if the continental margin does not stretch that far. Coastal states have the right of exploration and exploitation of its natural resources, however other states could lay cables and pipelines if they are authorised by the coastal state. The outer limit of a country's continental shelf shall not stretch beyond 350 nautical miles (650?km; 400?mi) of the baseline, or beyond 100 nautical miles (190?km; 120?mi) from the 2,500 metres (8,200?ft) isobath, which is a line connecting the depths of the seabed at 2,500 meters.\\r\\nThe outer edge of the continental margin for the purposes of this article is defined as:\\r\\nThe foot of the continental slope is determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base.\\r\\nThe portion of the continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile limit is also known as the extended continental shelf. Countries wishing to delimit their outer continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles have to submit information on their claim to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The Commission must make recommendations on matters related to the establishment of the outer limits of their continental shelf. The limits established based on these recommendations shall be final and binding.\\r\\nCountries were supposed to lodge their submissions to extend their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles within ten years of UNCLOS coming into force in the country, or by 13 May 2009 for countries where the convention had come into force before 13 May 1999. As of 1 June 2009, 51 submissions have been lodged with the Commission, of which eight have been deliberated by the Commission and have had recommendations issued. The eight are (in the order of date of submission): Russian Federation; Brazil; Australia; Ireland; New Zealand; the joint submission by France, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom; Norway and Mexico.\\r\\nFor full list, see below\\r\\nArticles 77 to 81 define the rights of a country over its continental shelf.\\r\\nA coastal nation has control of all resources on or under its continental shelf, living or not, but no control over any living organisms above the shelf that are beyond its exclusive economic zone. This gives it the right to conduct petroleum drilling works and lay submarine cables or pipelines in its continental shelf.\\r\\nAn example of this is the ongoing dispute over resources in the Arctic area, which will be decided by the exact mapping of the continental shelves.\\r\\nFrom the eighteenth century until the mid twentieth century, the territorial waters of the British Empire, the United States, France and many other nations were three nautical miles (5.6 km) wide. Originally, this was the length of a cannon shot, hence the portion of an ocean that a sovereign state could defend from shore. However, Iceland claimed two nautical miles (3.7?km), Norway and Sweden claimed four nautical miles (7.4?km), and Spain claimed 6 nautical miles (11?km; 6.9?mi) during this period. During incidents such as nuclear weapons testing and fisheries disputes some nations arbitrarily extended their maritime claims to as much as fifty or even two hundred nautical miles. Since the late 20th century the \\"12 mile limit\\" has become almost universally accepted. The United Kingdom extended its territorial waters from three to twelve nautical miles (22?km) in 1987.\\r\\nDuring the League of Nations Codification Conference in 1930, the issue of establishing international legislation on territorial waters was raised, but no agreement was reached.[6]\\r\\nClaims by legislation to the adjacent continental shelf and fishing was first made by the United States government immediately following the Second World War. On September 28, 1945, US President Harry S. Truman issued two proclamations that established government control of natural resources in areas adjacent to the coastline. One of these proclamation was titled \\"Policy of the United States With Respect to the Natural Resources of the Subsoil and Sea Bed of the Continental Shelf\\", and stipulated in its operative clause:\\r\\nthe Government of the United States regards the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the United States as appertaining to the United States, subject to its jurisdiction and control.[7]\\r\\nThe second proclamation was titled \\"Policy of the United States With Respect to Coastal Fisheries in Certain Areas of the High Seas\\", and stated in its operative clause:\\r\\nthe Government of the United States regards it as proper to establish conservation zones in those areas of the high seas contiguous to the coasts of the United States wherein fishing activities have been or in the future may be developed and maintained on a substantial scale.[8]\\r\\nFollowing the US Presidential proclamation, the issue of legally determining territorial waters by international agreement was raised, and in its first session in 1949, the International Law Commission of the United Nations added the subject to its agenda.\\r\\nThe important issue of the breadth of territorial waters could not be resolved at either the UNCLOS I (1956-1958) or UNCLOS II (1960) conferences, with neither the two major contenders of a 3-mile or 12-mile limit reaching the required two-thirds support. This lack of agreement had the potential to lead to serious international disputes.[5] It was only at the UNCLOS III (1973-1982) conference, whose provisions did not come into force until 1994, that this issue was resolved at twelve nautical miles.\\r\\nPirate radio broadcasting from artificial marine fixtures or anchored ships can be controlled by the affected coastal nation or other nations wherever that broadcast may originate, whether in the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf or even on the high seas.[9]\\r\\nThus a coastal nation has total control over its internal waters, slightly less control over territorial waters, and ostensibly even less control over waters within the contiguous zones. However, it has total control of economic resources within its exclusive economic zone as well as those on or under its continental shelf.\\r\\nThroughout this article, distances measured in nautical miles are exact legal definitions, while those in kilometres are approximate conversions that are not stated in any law or treaty.\\r\\nFederal nations, such as the United States, divide control over certain waters between the federal government and the individual states. (See tidelands.)\\r\\nMaritime controversies involve two dimensions: (a) territorial sovereignty, which are a legacy of history; and (b) relevant jurisdictional rights and interests in maritime boundaries, which are mainly due to differing interpretations of the law of the sea.[10]\\r\\nAs of 13 May 2009, 51 submissions by 44 countries have been lodged for claims over their extended continental shelf. Some countries have multiple submissions and joint submissions with other countries. Recommendations have been given for 8 of the submissions.\\r\\nList with date of submission and adoption of recommendation by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.[24]\\r\\nList in order of date of submission, with date of submission.[24]","input":"How many miles out to sea is international waters?"},{"output":"the half disme","context":"The numismatic history of the United States began with Colonial coins and paper money; most notably the foreign but widely accepted Spanish piece of eight,[1] ultimately descended from the Joachimsthaler and the direct ancestor of the U.S. Dollar.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaper money would not be printed by the United States until 1861.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coinage Act of 1792 established the United States Mint and regulated the coinage of the United States.[3]  The act created coins in the denominations of Half Cent (1/200 of a dollar), Cent (1/100 of a dollar, or a cent), Half Dime (also known as a half disme) (five cents), Dime (also known as a disme) (10 cents), Quarter (25 cents), Half Dollar (50 cents), Dollar, Quarter Eagle ($2.50), Half Eagle ($5), and Eagle ($10).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first coin minted under the act, and therefore the first official coin of the United States, was the half disme. According to legend these first half disme coins were minted from Martha Washington's silverware.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe half cent and cent were made of pure copper, the half dime, dime, quarter, half, and dollar in 90% silver, and the quarter, half and full eagle in .9167 gold (later changed to .8992 in 1834, and then 90% gold in 1837). All of the coins featured Liberty on the front and a bald eagle on the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis period of coinage covers several designs.  The Draped Bust design was featured on all copper and silver coins minted between 1796-1807.  On silver coins other than the dollar this design was followed by the Capped Bust.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days, often years went by without a certain denomination being minted.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited States Seated Liberty coinage was the silver coin design minted in the mid-to-late 19th century. It was the first seated-portrait U.S. coin, now-scarce Seated Liberty Dollar, and debuted in 1836. The seated liberty dime and seated liberty half dime followed the next year in 1837 and the seated liberty quarter and seated liberty half dollar in 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1849, in the wake of the California Gold Rush, the Double Eagle, or $20 gold denomination was added [5] This coin contains nearly a pure ounce of gold and were minted in large quantities; many still exist today and are used as bullion coins and command only a modest premium over spot price, though many dates are rare as well. The Liberty Head Double Eagle was minted up to 1907.\\r\\n\\r\\nRising copper prices caused the reduction of the size of the large cent. Originally, cent coins were large and heavy. This changed between 1856 and 1857 when they were replaced by the small-sized Flying Eagle cent, which was made of 88% copper and 12% nickel, and had a somewhat pale brown color. In 1859 this was replaced by the Indian Head cent, and by 1864, the Civil War increased nickel and copper prices and the cent was made thinner and the nickel removed; the cent was thus now a small, thin bronze coin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five cent nickel coin was introduced in 1866, and gradually it made the half dime obsolete. To this day, the nickel, though the design has changed, retains the same metallic content it had from its inception: ~25% nickel, ~75% copper.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second half of the 19th century saw several odd coin denominations. The two cent piece was minted from 1864 to 1873. It was the first American coin to display the phrase In God We Trust, a result of the increased wartime religiosity during the Civil War. Three cent pieces made of silver, and later copper-nickel, were also made around this era. From 1875 to 1878, Twenty cent pieces were made in the Seated Liberty design. A Three-dollar piece of gold was minted from 1854 to 1889.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1878, the first Morgan Silver Dollars were minted; this series lasted until 1904 and was revived for several months in 1921.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 1892 saw the designs of Charles E. Barber adorn the dime, quarter and half dollar. His Liberty Head nickel had debuted in 1883, and thus from the years 1892 to 1904, his designs were featured on every denomination from 5 cents up to one dollar. The Barber design would last on dimes and quarters up to 1916, on half dollars up to 1915, and on the nickel up to the extremely rare and famous 1913 Liberty Head nickels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal Reserve Notes were issued for the first time in 1917. Originally, these were backed by gold, and a note could be, at least in theory, exchanged for gold coin at a bank until 1933 when gold was confiscated from the general public. Silver certificates were exchangeable for silver coin up to June 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the American One dollar bill has stayed almost the same since 1935, and the other denominations had a similar appearance until their redesign in the late 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gold Eagle was re-designed in 1907 as the Indian Head eagle and the $2.50 and $5 pieces followed in 1908. The Liberty Head Double Eagle was replaced with the St. Gaudens Double Eagle in 1907. The wheat penny, with the head of Lincoln on the obverse, was introduced in 1909. The wheat penny was the first American coin that featured the face of an actual person (rather than Liberty). Also, the Buffalo nickel and Mercury dime were both introduced in the 1910s (1913 and 1916, respectively).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peace Dollar was minted from 1921 to 1935. After 1935, no more silver dollars would be minted for circulation by the US Mint. 90% silver dimes, quarters and half dollars were replaced with copper-nickel coins after 1964. From 1965 to 1976, 40% silver coins were issued in certain denominations. Of these, only the 1965 to 1969 dated Kennedy Half Dollars were minted for general circulation. No precious metals were present in any coins issued after 1977 by the US Mint until the bullion and commemorative series that began in the 1980s and continue to the present day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs there were no more gold coins or silver dollars after the Executive Order 6102 of 1933 minted in the United States, paper notes took place of the coin denominations above 50 cents. Up to 1964, dimes, quarters and half dollars were still minted in 90% silver; halves would contain 40% silver from 1965 to 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new tradition of placing past presidents and Founding Fathers on coins, which had begun with the 1909 Lincoln cent, continued in the 1930s and 1940s, with the introduction of the Washington quarter in 1932, the Jefferson nickel in 1938, the Roosevelt dime in 1946, and the Franklin half dollar in 1948. The original Washington quarter design remained unchanged, aside from the removal of silver content and finer details, up to 1998, the Jefferson nickel up to 2003, and the Roosevelt dime to the present day. The Franklin half was replaced by the John F. Kennedy half dollar in 1964 to commemorate him after his murder. The composition of the Kennedy half dollar was changed from 90% silver to 40% silver in 1965 and remained that way through 1970. After 1970, Kennedy half dollars were made of the same copper-nickel alloy as the other denominations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last 90% silver circulated coins are dated 1964,[7] though they were actually minted for several years later dated as 1964. In 1982, the penny had most of its copper content removed, and is now made primarily of zinc, with a thin copper plating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper money of the United States was re-designed to deter counterfeit through the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican coinage and paper money has gone through significant changes since the late 1990s. Up to the mid-1990s, American money had changed little since the end of silver coins in the mid-1960s, and some of the denominations, including the paper notes and the nickel, had barely changed since the 1930s.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1996 with the $100 and $50 bills, paper money was redesigned to deter counterfeit. In 1999, the State Quarter program ended the classic design of the Washington quarter. Next came the 2004 nickels, meant to commemorate Lewis and Clark's 200th anniversary. The cent was re-designed in 2009 to commemorate Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday. After 2009, the Shield Penny design, representing how Lincoln preserved the Union, appeared on the reverse of pennies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dollar coin returned in 1999, in a case very similar to the 1921 Morgan dollar, with the Susan B. Anthony dollar, to fill in until the Sacagawea Dollar came about in 2000. Concurrent is the Presidential Dollar series, which, as of March 2016, is set to end in fall 2016.","input":"What was the first coin minted in the united states?"},{"output":"13th century","context":"Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.\\r\\nSunglasses allow better vision in bright daylight, and may protect one's eyes against damage from high levels of ultraviolet light. Typical sunglasses are darkened for protection against bright light or glare; some specialized glasses are clear in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when in bright light. Most sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be ordered. Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information (such as stereoscopy) or 3D glasses for viewing three-dimensional movies. Sometimes glasses with no corrective power in the lenses are worn simply for aesthetic or fashion purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of designs are available for fashion purposes, using plastic, wire, and other materials.\\r\\nPeople are more likely to need glasses the older they get with 93% of people between the age of 65-75 wearing corrective lenses.[1][2]\\r\\nGlasses come in many styles. They can be marked or found by their primary function, but also appear in combinations such as prescription sunglasses or safety glasses with enhanced magnification.\\r\\nCorrective lenses are used to correct refractive errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (Hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. Also, few people have eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one may need a \\"stronger\\", (i.e. more refracting), lens than the other. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which is caused by the eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Corrective lenses, to bring the image back into focus on the retina, are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting.\\r\\nPinhole glasses are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change focal length. Instead, they create a diffraction limited system, which has an increased depth of field, similar to using a small aperture in photography. This form of correction has many limitations that prevent it from gaining popularity in everyday use. Pinhole glasses can be made in a DIY fashion by making small holes in a piece of card which is then held in front of the eyes with a strap or cardboard arms.\\r\\nThe most common type of corrective lens is \\"single vision\\", which has a uniform refractive index. For people with presbyopia and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. Reading glasses provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have two simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required. Adjustable-focus eyeglasses might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).\\r\\nSafety glasses are worn to protect the eyes in different situations. They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called \\"flash goggles\\", because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes as well as in front of the eyes.\\r\\nSunglasses provide improved comfort and protection against bright light and often against ultraviolet (UV) light. Photochromic lenses, which are photosensitive, darken when struck by UV light. The dark tint of the lenses in a pair of sunglasses blocks the transmission of light through the lens.\\r\\nLight polarization is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed. Liquid crystal displays often emit polarized light making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include teashades and mirrorshades. Many blind people wear nearly opaque glasses to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons.\\r\\nSunglasses may also have corrective lenses, which requires a prescription. Clip-on sunglasses or sunglass clips can be attached to another pair of glasses. Some wrap-around sunglasses are large enough to be worn over top of another pair of glasses. Otherwise, many people opt to wear contact lenses to correct their vision so that standard sunglasses can be used.\\r\\nThe illusion of three dimensions on a two dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering a signal containing information for both eyes. The signal, often light reflected off a movie screen or emitted from an electronic display, is filtered so that each eye receives a slightly different image. The filters only work for the type of signal they were designed for.\\r\\nAnaglyph 3D glasses have a different colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A polarized 3D system on the other hand uses polarized filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An active shutter 3D system uses electronic shutters. Head-mounted displays can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewers eyes.\\r\\nAnaglyph and polarized glasses are distributed to audiences at 3D movies. Polarized and active shutter glasses are used with many home theaters. Head-mounted displays are used by a single person, but the input signal can be shared between multiple units.\\r\\nGlasses can also provide magnification that is useful for people with vision impairments or specific occupational demands. An example would be bioptics or bioptic telescopes which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses. Newer designs use smaller lightweight telescopes, which can be embedded into the corrective glass and improve aesthetic appearance (mini telescopic spectacles). They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble goggles or binoculars, or may be attached to existing glasses.\\r\\nYellow tinted glasses are a type of glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of reducing headaches due to lack of blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses.[3] Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain.[4] These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames.[5] Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related macular degeneration.[6][7]\\r\\nAnti-glare protection glasses, or anti-reflective glasses, can reduce the reflection of light that enters our eyes. The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions. By reducing the amount of glare on your eyes, vision can be improved.[8] The anti-glare also applies to the outer glass, thus allowing for better eye contact.[8]\\r\\nThe ophthalmic frame is the part of a pair of glasses which is designed to hold the lenses in proper position. Ophthalmic frames come in a variety of styles, sizes, materials, shapes, and colors.[9]\\r\\nCorrective lenses can be produced in many different shapes from a circular lens called a lens blank. Lens blanks are cut to fit the shape of the frame that will hold them. Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes. For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions which allows for many trendy and fashionable shapes. Higher power lenses can cause distortion of peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used. However, if the lens becomes too small, the field of view can be drastically reduced.\\r\\nBifocal, trifocal, and progressive lenses generally require a taller lens shape to leave room for the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting myopic prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began to be seen as an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.\\r\\nScattered evidence exists for use of vision aid devices in greek and roman times, most prominently the use of an emerald by emperor Nero as mentioned by Pliny the Elder[12].\\r\\nThe use of a convex lens to form an enlarged/magnified image was most likely described in Ptolemy's Optics (which however only survives in a poor Arabic translation). Ptolemy's description of lenses was commented upon and improved by Ibn Sahl (10th century) and most notably by Alhazen (Book of Optics, ca. 1021). Latin translations of Ptolemy's Optics and of Alhazen became available in Europe in the 12th century, coinciding with the development of \\"reading stones\\".\\r\\nRobert Grosseteste's treatise De iride (\\"On the Rainbow\\"), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to \\"read the smallest letters at incredible distances\\". A few years later in 1262, Roger Bacon is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses.[13] The development of the first eyeglasses took place in Northern Italy in the second half of the 13th century.[14]\\r\\nIndependently of the development of optical lenses, some cultures developed \\"sunglasses\\" for eye protection, without any corrective properties.[15] Thus, flat panes of smoky quartz, were used in 12th-century China.[a] Similarly, the Inuit have used snow goggles for eye protection.\\r\\nThe first eyeglasses were made in Northern Italy, most likely in Pisa, by about 1290: In a sermon delivered on 23 February 1306, the Dominican friar Giordano da Pisa (ca. 1255ÿ1311) wrote \\"It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision... And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered.?... I saw the one who first discovered and practiced it, and I talked to him.\\"[17]\\r\\nGiordano's colleague Friar Alessandro della Spina of Pisa (d. 1313) was soon making eyeglasses. The Ancient Chronicle of the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine in Pisa records: \\"Eyeglasses, having first been made by someone else, who was unwilling to share them, he [Spina] made them and shared them with everyone with a cheerful and willing heart.\\"[18] By 1301, there were guild regulations in Venice governing the sale of eyeglasses.[19]\\r\\nThe earliest pictorial evidence for the use of eyeglasses is Tommaso da Modena's 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a scriptorium. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the Alps in an altarpiece of the church of Bad Wildungen, Germany, in 1403. These early glasses had convex lenses that could correct both hyperopia (farsightedness), and the presbyopia that commonly develops as a symptom of aging. It was not until 1604 that Johannes Kepler published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct presbyopia and myopia.[b]\\r\\nEarly frames for glasses consisted of two magnifying glasses riveted together by the handles so that they could grip the nose. These are referred to as \\"rivet spectacles\\". The earliest surviving examples were found under the floorboards at Kloster Wienhausen, a convent near Celle in Germany; they have been dated to circa 1400.[22]\\r\\nClaims that Salvino degli Armati of Florence invented eyeglasses have been exposed as hoaxes.[23][24]\\r\\nMarco Polo is sometimes claimed to have encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century, however, no such statement appears in his accounts.[25][26] Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported.[27]\\r\\nIt is also sometimes claimed that glasses were first invented in India. In 1907 Professor Berthold Laufer stated in his history of glasses that \\"the opinion that spectacles originated in India is of the greatest probability and that spectacles must have been known in India earlier than in Europe\\".[28] However, Joseph Needham showed that the mention of glasses in the manuscript Laufer used to justify the prior invention of them in Asia did not exist in older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty.[29] In an 1971 article in the British Journal of Ophthalmology it was argued that it: \\"...is therefore most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did Hindu mathematics and the ophthalmological works of the ancient Hindu surgeon Susruta\\",[30] but all dates given are well after the existence of eyeglasses in Italy was established, and there had been significant shipments of eye glasses from Italy to the Middle East, with one shipment as large as 24,000 glasses.[31]\\r\\nThe American scientist Benjamin Franklin, who suffered from both myopia and presbyopia, invented bifocals. Serious historians have from time to time produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of The Gazette of the United States, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought.[32] The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the British astronomer George Airy in 1825.[33]\\r\\nOver time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (pince-nez). Girolamo Savonarola suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a hat. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed some time before 1727, possibly by the British optician Edward Scarlett. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as \\"scissors-glasses\\" and lorgnettes were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, Moritz von Rohr and Zeiss (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld[34]), developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, Joshua Silver designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by silicone liquid, a syringe, and a pressure mechanism.[35]\\r\\nDespite the increasing popularity of contact lenses and laser corrective eye surgery, glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special memory metal alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as titanium alloys, which were not available in earlier times.\\r\\nIn the 1930s, \\"spectacles\\" were described as \\"medical appliances.\\"[36] Wearing spectacles was sometimes considered socially humiliating. In the 1970s, fashionable glasses started to become available through manufacturers, and the government also recognized the demand for stylized eyewear.[36]\\r\\nGraham Pullin describes how devices for disability, like glasses, have traditionally been designed to camouflage against the skin and restore ability without being visible.[36] In the past, design for disability has \\"been less about projecting a positive image as about trying not to project an image at all.\\"[36] Pullin uses the example of spectacles, traditionally categorized as a medical device for \\"patients\\", and outlines how they are now described as eyewear: a fashionable accessory.[36] Much like other fashion designs and accessories, eyewear is created by designers, has reputable labels, and comes in collections, by season and designer.[36] It is becoming more common for consumers purchase eyewear with clear, non-prescription lenses, illustrating that glasses are no longer a social stigma, but a fashionable accessory that \\"frames your face.\\"[36]\\r\\nSome organizations like Lions Clubs International,[37] Unite For Sight,[38], ReSpectacle,[39] and New Eyes for the Needy provide a way to donate glasses and sunglasses. Unite For Sight has redistributed more than 200,000 pairs.[40]\\r\\nMany people require glasses for the reasons listed above. There are many shapes, colors, and materials that can be used when designing frames and lenses that can be utilized in various combinations. Oftentimes, the selection of a frame is made based on how it will affect the appearance of the wearer. Some people with good natural eyesight like to wear eyeglasses as a style accessory.\\r\\nFor most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen (as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses), elderly, or physically weak and passive.[41][42] The stigma began to fall away in the early 1900s when the popular Theodore Roosevelt was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian Harold Lloyd began wearing a pair of horn-rimmed glasses as the \\"Glasses\\" character in his films.[41][42]\\r\\nSince, eyeglasses have become an acceptable fashion item and often act as a key component in individuals' personal image. Musicians Buddy Holly and John Lennon became synonymous with the styles of eye-glasses they wore to the point that thick, black horn-rimmed glasses are often called \\"Buddy Holly glasses\\" and perfectly round metal eyeglass frames called \\"John Lennon (or Harry Potter) Glasses.\\" British comedic actor Eric Sykes was known in the United Kingdom for wearing thick, square, horn-rimmed glasses, which were in fact a sophisticated hearing aid that alleviated his deafness by allowing him to \\"hear\\" vibrations.[43] Some celebrities have become so associated with their eyeglasses that they continued to wear them even after taking alternate measures against vision problems: United States Senator Barry Goldwater and comedian Drew Carey continued to wear non-prescription glasses after being fitted for contacts and getting laser eye surgery, respectively.\\r\\nOther celebrities have used glasses to differentiate themselves from the characters they play, such as Anne Kirkbride, who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as Deirdre Barlow in the soap opera Coronation Street, and Masaharu Morimoto, who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a chef from his stage persona as Iron Chef Japanese. In 2012 some NBA players wear lensless glasses with thick plastic frames like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to Steve Urkel.[44][45]\\r\\nIn superhero fiction, eyeglasses have become a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor when they are not in their superhero persona: Superman is well known for wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent, while Wonder Woman wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style bug-eye glasses as Diana Prince. An example of the halo effect is seen in the stereotype that those who wear glasses are intelligent.\\r\\nIn the 20th century, eyeglasses came to be considered a component of fashion; as such, various different styles have come in and out of popularity. Most are still in regular use, albeit with varying degrees of frequency.","input":"When were the first pair of eyeglasses made?"},{"output":"Golden Globe Award","context":"American actor Leonardo DiCaprio has won 54 awards from 161 nominations, and was named runner-up for 4 of those nominations.

The movement was eventually led by Vallabhbhai Patel, and its success gave rise to Patel becoming one of the main leaders of the independence movement.[1][2][3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1925, the taluka of Bardoli in Gujarat suffered from floods and famine, causing crop production to suffer and leaving farmers facing great financial troubles. However, the government of the Bombay Presidency had raised the tax rate by 30% that year, and despite petitions from civic groups, refused to cancel the rise in the face of the calamities. The situation for the farmers was grave enough that they barely had enough property and crops to pay off the tax, let alone for feeding themselves afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gujarati activists Narhari Parikh, Ravi Shankar Vyas, and Mohanlal Pandya talked to village chieftains and farmers, and solicited the help of Gujarat's most prominent freedom fighter, Vallabhbhai Patel. Patel had previously guided Gujarat's farmers during the Kheda struggle, and had served recently as Ahmedabad's municipal president. He was widely respected by common Gujaratis across the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatel told a delegation of farmers frankly that if they should realize fully what a revolt would imply. He would not lead them unless he had the unanimous understanding and agreement of all the villages involved. Refusing payment of taxes could lead to their property being confiscated, including their lands, and many would go to jail. They could face complete decimation. The villagers replied that they were prepared for the worst, but definitely could not accept the government's injustice.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPatel then asked Gandhi to consider the matter. But Gandhi merely asked what Patel thought, and when the latter replied with confidence about the prospects, he gave his blessing. But Gandhi and Patel agreed that neither the Congress nor Gandhi would directly involve themselves, and the struggle left entirely to the people of Bardoli taluka.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatel first wrote to the Governor of Bombay, asking him to reduce the taxes for the year in face of the calamities. But the Governor ignored the letter, and reciprocated by announcing the date of collection. \\r\\n\\r\\nPatel then instructed all the farmers of Bardoli taluka to refuse payment of their taxes. Aided by Parikh, Vyas and Pandya, he divided Bardoli into several zones ÿ each with a leader and volunteers specifically assigned. Patel also placed some  activists close to the government, to act as informers on the movements of government officials. \\r\\n\\r\\nAbove all, Patel instructed the farmers to remain completely non-violent, and not respond physically to any incitements or aggressive actions from officials. He reassured them that the struggle would not end until not only the cancellation of all taxes for the year, but also when all the seized property and lands were returned to their rightful owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmers received complete support from their compatriots in Gujarat. Many hid their most precious belongings with relatives in other parts, and the protestors received financial support and essential supplies from supporters in other parts. But Patel refused permission to enthusiastic supporters in Gujarat and other parts of India from going on sympathetic protest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government declared that it would crush the revolt. Along with tax inspectors, bands of Pathans were gathered from northwest India to forcibly seize the property of the villagers and terrorize them. The Pathans and the men of the collectors forced themselves into the houses and took all property, including cattle (resisters had begun keeping their cattle inside their locked homes when the collectors were about, in order to prevent them from seizing the animals from the fields).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government began to auction the houses and the lands. But not a single man from Gujarat or anywhere else in India came forward to buy them. Patel had appointed volunteers in every village to keep watch. As soon as he sighted the officials who were coming to auction the property, the volunteer would sound his bugle. The farmers would leave the village and hide in the jungles. The officials would find the entire village empty.[7] They could never find out who owned a particular house. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some rich people from Bombay came to buy some lands. There was also one village recorded that paid the tax. A complete social boycott was organized against them, wherein relatives broke their ties to families in the village. Other ways social boycott was enforced against landowners who broke with the tax strike or purchased seized land were to refuse to rent their fields or to work as laborers for them.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the legislative councils of Bombay and across India were angered by the terrible treatment of the protesting farmers. Indian members resigned their offices, and expressed open support of the farmers.[9] The Government was heavily criticized, even by many in the Raj's offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, an agreement was finally brokered by a Parsi member of the Bombay government. The Government agreed to restore the confiscated lands and properties, as well as cancel revenue payment not only for the year, but cancel the 30% raise until after the succeeding year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmers celebrated their victory, but Patel continued to work to ensure that all lands and properties were returned to every farmer, and that no one was left out. When the Government refused to ask the people who had bought some of the lands to return them, wealthy sympathizers from Bombay bought them out, and returned the lands to the rightful owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe momentum from the Bardoli victory aided in the resurrection of the freedom struggle nationwide.[10] In 1930, the Congress would declare Indian independence, and the Salt Satyagraha would be launched by Gandhi. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Patel credited Gandhi's teachings and the farmers' undying resolve, people across the nation recognized his vital leadership. It was women of bardoli who bestowed the title Sardar for the first time, which in Gujarati and most Indian languages means Chief or Leader. It was after Bardoli that Sardar Patel became one of India's most important leaders.","input":"Who launched the bardoli satyagraha on 4th february 1928?"},{"output":"years","context":"Island of the Blue Dolphins is a 1960  children's novel written by Scott O'Dell and tells the story of a 12-year-old girl stranded alone for years on an island off the California coast.

With colleagues Ren Vellanoweth, Lisa Barnett-Thomas, and Troy Davis, Erlandson salvaged the boxes and other artifacts before they were destroyed by erosion. Vellanoweth and Barnett-Thomas later excavated the interior of the boxes in a San Nicolas Island laboratory and documented nearly 200 artifacts of Nicole?o, Euro-American, and Native Alaskan manufacture.[3] The boxes appear to have been cached intentionally some time between 1815 and 1853, quite possibly by Juana Maria herself. It was also believed the Lone Woman lived in a cave on the island. In 2012, Naval archaeologist Steve Schwartz believed he discovered the buried location of that cave and began an investigation, working with archaeologist Ren Vellanoweth and his students from California State University, Los Angeles.[4] Commanders at the Navy base on the island about 65 miles southwest of Point Mugu ordered Schwartz to halt the dig in 2015.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main character is a Native American girl named Karana. Her secret name is Won-a-pa-lei She has a brother named Ramo, whose curiosity usually leads to trouble, and a sister named Ulape. Her people live in a village called Ghalas-at and the tribe survives by means of gathering roots and fishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, a ship of Russian fur hunters and Aleut people led by Captain Orlov arrive and persuade the natives to let them hunt sea otter in exchange for other goods. However, the Russians attempt to swindle the islanders and leave without paying. When they are confronted by Karana's father Chief Chowig, a battle breaks out. The tribe is reduced with Karana's father and many other men in the tribe dying in battle against the well-armed Russians who escape largely unscathed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, the \\"replacement chief\\" Chief Kimki leaves the island on a canoe for new land in the East. Eventually, he sends a \\"giant canoe\\" to bring his people to the mainland even though he himself does not return. The white men who are missionaries come to Karana's village and tell them to pack their goods and go to the ship. Karana's brother Ramo misses the ship to retrieve his fishing spear. Although Karana urges the captain to wait for Ramo to return, the ship must leave before a storm approaches. Despite restraint, Karana jumps off the ship and swims to shore and the ship departs without them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe siblings live alone on the island, hoping the ship will return. However, Ramo is brutally killed by a pack of feral dogs. Alone on the island, Karana takes on traditionally male tasks, such as hunting, making spears, and building canoes to survive. She vows to avenge her brother's death and kills several of the dogs, but has a change of heart when she encounters the leader of the pack. She tames him and names him Rontu (meaning \\"Fox Eyes\\" in her language).\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, Karana makes a life for herself. She builds a home made of whale bones and stocks a cave with provisions in case the Aleuts come back, so she can hide from them. As she explores her island, Karana discovers ancient artifacts and a large squid (which she calls a devilfish). As time passes, she decides to hunt the devilfish. She also tames some birds and an otter while feeling a close kinship to the animals (the only inhabitants of the island beside herself).\\r\\n\\r\\nOne summer, the Aleuts return and Karana takes refuge in the cave. She observes the Aleuts closely and realizes that a girl named Tutok takes care of the domestic duties including getting water from the pool near Karana's cave. Fearful of being discovered, Karana goes out only at night, yet the curious girl stalks Karana and the two meet. Karana and Tutok meet several days in a row. However, when she lets Rontu out with her, Tutok calls him hers. Karana and Tutok exchange gifts, and she realizes how lonely she's been. Karana wishes that Tutok would not leave, yet the next day when Karana makes food for her she doesn't come. Karana goes searching and sees the ship departing. Sadly, she returns to her house and starts rebuilding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore time passes and Rontu dies. Karana soon finds a young dog that looks like Rontu and takes him in naming him Rontu-Aru (meaning \\"Son of Rontu\\"). One day, Karana sees the sails of a ship. It docks at the shore, but then leaves. Two years later in the spring, the boat comes back, so Karana dresses in her finest attire and goes to the shore to meet the boat. Her rescuers see that her dress made of cormorant feathers is not appropriate for the mainland and they have a dress made for her. She does not like the dress, but Karana realizes that it is part of her new life. The ship takes Karana and Rontu-Aru to the mission in Santa Barbara, California. There, she finds out that the ship that had taken her people away had sunk, before it could return from the mainland for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nA film adaptation of Island of the Blue Dolphins was released on July 3, 1964. It was directed by James B. Clark and starred Celia Kaye as Karana. Jane Klove and Ted Sherdeman adapted the script from O'Dell's novel, and the film was produced by Robert B. Radnitz and Universal Pictures. The film was made on a slight budget but did receive a wide release three months after its New York premiere.[7][8] The New York Times's Howard Thompson gave the film a rather condescending review upon its release, saying it was strictly a children's film.[9] However, Kaye won a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year for her performance.[10] The film earned an estimated $2 million in rentals in North America.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n[[Category:1960 money","input":"How long did karana live on the island alone?"},{"output":"The Goliath birdeater","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) belongs to the tarantula family Theraphosidae. Found in northern South America, it is the largest spider in the world by mass and size, but it is second to the giant huntsman spider by leg-span.[1] It is also called the Goliath bird-eating spider; the practice of calling theraphosids \\"bird-eating\\" derives from an early 18th-century copper engraving by Maria Sibylla Merian that shows one eating a hummingbird. Despite the spider's name, it only rarely preys on birds.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goliath birdeater is native to the upland rain forest regions of northern South America: Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, northern Brazil and southern Venezuela. Most noticeable is in the Amazon rainforest, the spider is terrestrial, living in deep burrows, and is found commonly in marshy or swampy areas.  It is a nocturnal species.[3] The spider is part of the local cuisine in northeastern South America, prepared by singeing off the urticating hairs and roasting it in banana leaves. The flavor has been described as \\"shrimplike\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other species of spider/tarantula, females do not eat the males during mating. Females mature in 3 to 6 years and have an average life span of 15 to 25 years. Males die soon after maturity and have a lifespan of 3 to 6 years. Colors range from dark to light brown with faint markings on the legs. Birdeaters have hair on their bodies, abdomens, and legs. The female lays anywhere from 100 to 200 eggs, which hatch into spiderlings within six to eight weeks.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese spiders can have a leg span of up to 28?cm (11?in), a body length of up to 11.9?cm (4.7?in) and can weigh up to 175?g (6.2?oz).[7] Birdeaters are one of the few tarantula species that lack tibial spurs, located on the first pair of legs of most adult males.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to threats, Goliath birdeaters stridulate by rubbing setae on their pedipalps and legs.[8] Also when threatened, they rub their abdomen with their hind legs and release hairs that are a severe irritant to the skin and mucous membranes. These urticating hairs can be harmful to humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all tarantulas, T. blondi have fangs large enough to break the skin of a human (1.9ÿ3.8?cm or 0.75ÿ1.50?in). They carry venom in their fangs and have been known to bite when threatened, but the venom is relatively harmless and its effects are comparable to those of a wasp's sting. Tarantulas generally bite humans only in self-defense, and these bites do not always result in envenomation (known as a \\"dry bite\\").\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The spider has three lines of defense. By rubbing its legs against its abdomen, it produces a cloud of tiny, barbed hairs that get in the eyes and mucous membranes and cause extreme pain and itching for days. It has two-inch-long fangs strong enough to pierce a mouse's skull. And it can make a hissing sound by rubbing its hairs together, which sounds like pulling Velcro apart.\\" [9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its name, it is rare for the Goliath birdeater to actually prey on birds; in the wild, its diet consists primarily of other large arthropods, worms, and amphibians.[10] However, because of its size and opportunistic predatory behavior, it is not uncommon for this species to kill and consume a variety of insects and small terrestrial vertebrates. In the wild, T. blondi has been observed feeding on rodents, frogs, toads, lizards, and even snakes.[11]","input":"Who is the largest spider in the world?"},{"output":"Josep Maria Bartomeu","context":"","input":"Who is the owner of barcelona football club?"},{"output":"more than 41 million","context":"The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I was more than 41 million: there were over 18 million deaths and 23 million wounded, ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history.\\r\\nThe total number of deaths includes from 9 to 11 million military personnel and about 5 to 6 million civilians. The Triple Entente (also known as the Allies) lost about 6 million military personnel while the Central Powers lost about 4 million. At least 2 million died from diseases and 6 million went missing, presumed dead. This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources. About two-thirds of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century when the majority of deaths were due to disease. Nevertheless, disease, including the 1918 flu pandemic and deaths while held as prisoners of war, still caused about one third of total military deaths for all belligerents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCasualty statistics for World War I vary to a great extent; estimates of total deaths range from 9 million to over 15 million.[1] Military casualties reported in official sources list deaths due to all causes, including an estimated 7 to 8 million combat related deaths (killed or died of wounds) and another two to three million military deaths caused by accidents, disease and deaths while prisoners of war. Official government reports listing casualty statistics were published by the United States and Great Britain.[2][3] These secondary sources published during the 1920s, are the source of the statistics in reference works listing casualties in World War I.[4][5][6][7][8] This article summarizes the casualty statistics published in the official government reports of the United States and Great Britain as well as France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Russia. More recently the research of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has revised the military casualty statistics of the UK and its allies; they include in their listing of military war dead personnel outside of combat theaters and civilians recruited from Africa, the Middle East and China who provided logistical and service support in combat theaters.[9][10][11][12][13] The casualties of these support personnel recruited outside of Europe were previously not included with British war dead, however the casualties of the Labour Corps recruited from the British Isles were included in the rolls of British war dead published in 1921.[14] The methodology used by each nation to record and classify casualties was not uniform, a general caveat regarding casualty figures is that they cannot be considered comparable in all cases.[15]\\r\\nFirst World War civilian deaths are \\"hazardous to estimate\\" according to Michael Clodfelter who maintains that \\"the generally accepted figure of noncombatant deaths is 6.5 million.\\"[16] The figures listed below include about 6 million excess civilian deaths due to war related privations, that are often omitted from other compilations of World War I casualties. The war brought about malnutrition and disease caused by the U-boat Campaign and the Blockade of Germany which disrupted trade resulting in food shortages.

Five sixths of the island left to form the Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland, in 1922. A total of 206,000 Irishmen served in the British forces during the war.[91] The number of Irish deaths in the British Army recorded by the registrar general was 27,405.[92] A significant number of these casualties were from what, in 1920, became Northern Ireland. While 49,400 soldiers died serving in Irish divisions (the 10th, 16th and 36th), although not all of the men serving in these divisions were natives of Ireland and many Irish who died in non-Irish regiments are not listed.[93][94] For example, 29% of the casualties in the 16th Division were not natives of Ireland.[92] Neither does it include Irish emigrants in Britain who enlisted there and are not categorised as Irish. Australia lists 4,731 of its first World War soldiers as having been born in Ireland and more than 19,000 Irish-born soldiers served in the Canadian Corps. The rolls do list 30,986 soldiers who were born in Ireland.

Founded in 1908 as the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg, the institution was renamed Madison College in 1938 in honor of President James Madison and then James Madison University in 1977.[4] The university is situated in the Shenandoah Valley, with the campus quadrangle located on South Main Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 1908 as a women's college, James Madison University was established by the Virginia General Assembly. It was originally called The State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg. In 1914, the name of the university was changed to the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg. At first, academic offerings included only today's equivalent of technical training or junior college courses; however authorization to award bachelor's degrees was granted in 1916. During this initial period of development, the campus plan was established and six buildings were constructed.[5]\\r\\nThe university became the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg in 1924 and continued under that name until 1938, when it was named Madison College in honor of James Madison, the fourth President of the United States whose Montpelier estate is located in nearby Orange, Virginia. In 1976, the university's name was changed to James Madison University.[5]\\r\\nThe first president of the university was Julian Ashby Burruss. The university opened its doors to its first student body in 1909 with an enrollment of 209 students and a faculty of 15. Its first 20 graduates received diplomas in 1911.[5]\\r\\nIn 1919, Julian Burruss resigned the presidency to become president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Samuel Page Duke was then chosen as the second president of the university. During Duke's administration, nine major buildings were constructed.[5] Duke served as president from 1919 to 1949.\\r\\nIn 1946, men were first enrolled as regular day students. G. Tyler Miller became the third president of the university in 1949, following the retirement of Samuel Duke. During Miller's administration, from 1949 to 1970, the campus was enlarged by 240 acres (0.97?km2) and 19 buildings were constructed. Major curriculum changes were made and the university was authorized to grant master's degrees in 1954.[5]\\r\\nIn 1966, by action of the Virginia General Assembly, the university became a coeducational institution. Ronald E. Carrier, JMU's fourth president, headed the institution from 1971 to 1998. During Carrier's administration, student enrollment and the number of faculty and staff tripled, doctoral programs were authorized, more than twenty major campus buildings were constructed and the university was recognized repeatedly by national publications as one of the finest institutions of its type in America. Carrier Library is named after him.[5]\\r\\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, during the administration of JMU's fifth President Linwood H. Rose, the university continued to rapidly expand, not only through new construction east of Interstate 81, but also on the west side of campus. In early 2005, JMU purchased the Rockingham Memorial Hospital campus just north of the main JMU campus for over $40 million. The hospital has since moved to a new location, and JMU now occupies the former hospital site after having made substantial renovations to the previous hospital campus.[6] Additionally in June 2005, the university expanded across South High Street by leasing the former Harrisonburg High School building from the City of Harrisonburg. In May 2006, the university purchased the property.[7] The sale was approved in June 2005 for $17 million.[8][9] The university named the old HHS building Memorial Hall.[10] Recently completed projects include the Rose Library located on the east side of campus, which opened on August 11, 2008. The John C. Wells Planetarium, first opened in 1974, underwent a $1.5 million renovation in 2008. It is now a state-of-the-art hybrid planetarium, the only one of its kind in the world. The mission of the JMU Planetarium is science education and public outreach. As such, it offers free shows to the public every Saturday afternoon and hosts annual summer space camps in July. The 175,000-square-foot (16,300?m2) Forbes Center for the Performing Arts opened in June 2010, and serves as the home to JMU's School of Theatre and Dance. It also provides major performance venues and support spaces for the School of Music, and the administrative office for the Dean of the College of Visual and Performing Arts.\\r\\nThe rapid expansion of JMU's campus has at times created tension in the city-university relationship.[11] In 2006, the local ABC affiliate reported that the university had nearly doubled in size in the last 20 years,[12] including purchases of several local properties.[13][14]\\r\\nThe university has also experienced tension with local residents with occasional clashes between local police and students at a popular off-campus block party. In 2000, the party with about 2,500 students grew out of hand and required a police presence at the Forest Hills townhouse complex on Village Lane.[15] Ten years later, police equipped with riot gear used force to disperse a group of 8,000 college-aged individuals at the party.[16][17][18] Several participants were airlifted to a medical center in Charlottesville to treat their injuries.[19] The university has condemned the behavior of the block party attendees.[20]\\r\\nJames Madison University is considered \\"More Selective\\" by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. For the Class of 2012, the university received 22,648[21] applications, for an entering freshmen class of 4,325 for the 2012ÿ2013 academic year.[22] The retention rate for the 2011ÿ2012 freshman class was 91.4%, and the ratio of female to male students is 60/40. Approximately 38% of students are from out-of-state, representing all 50 states and 89 foreign countries.\\r\\nCurrently, James Madison University offers 115 degree programs on the bachelor's, master's, educational specialist, and doctoral levels. The university comprises seven colleges and 78 academic programs. The university includes the College of Arts and Letters; the College of Business; the College of Education; the College of Health and Behavioral Studies; the College of Integrated Science and Engineering; the College of Science and Mathematics; the College of Visual and Performing Arts; and The Graduate School. Total enrollment beginning the Fall 2012 academic year was 19,927; 18,392 undergraduates and 1,820 graduate students. JMU granted 4,908 degrees in 2012; 4,096 undergraduate degrees, and 812 graduate degrees.\\r\\nOn October 2, 2009, James Madison University was granted a chapter by the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society.[23] Only about 10 percent of the country's colleges and universities have Phi Beta Kappa chapters. James Madison University's Chapter of Phi Kappa Phi was the first academic honor society chartered at JMU. The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi (or simply Phi Kappa Phi or ӿ) is an honor society established in 1897 to recognize and encourage superior scholarship without restriction as to area of study and to promote the \\"unity and democracy of education\\".\\r\\nOn June 24, 2004, the Board of Visitors approved the Madison College Proposal, which created the College of Visual and Performing Arts out of the College of Arts and Letters. The College of Visual and Performing Arts includes the School of Art, Design and Art History, the School of Music, the School of Theatre and Dance, and the Madison Art Collection. Approximately 1,200 students are enrolled in the college, and the Master of Fine Arts degree offered by the School of Art, Design and Art History is nationally ranked by U.S. News and World Report.\\r\\nOn January 9, 2007, the School of Engineering was approved by the Virginia higher education governing body.[24] The school began accepting undergraduates in Fall 2008. The program focuses on sustainability with a major emphasis on the environmental sciences. The School of Engineering offers general engineering degrees with no specializations.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. News & World Report ranked JMU as the No. 2 public masters-level university in the South (7th overall) for 2016.[28] In the 2015 edition of the Washington Monthly college rankings, JMU ranked 68th among master's universities. Washington Monthly assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country).[29]\\r\\nJMU's College of Business was ranked 40th among the undergraduate business programs in the U.S. by BloombergBusiness in 2014.[30] The university is also ranked 21st in value in the nation among public colleges and universities, according to Kiplinger magazine's 2015 \\"100 Best Values in Public Colleges\\".[31] JMU ranked 15th among all undergraduate business schools in the country for return on investment, according to BloombergBusiness in 2013.[32]\\r\\nThe campus of JMU originally consisted of two buildings, known today as Jackson and Maury Halls.[33] Today, the campus of James Madison University has 148 major buildings on 721 acres (2.92?km2).[34] The campus is divided into five parts: Bluestone, Hillside, Lakeside, Skyline, and the Village.[35] The Skyline area is located on the east side of Interstate 81, while the Bluestone, Hillside, Lakeside, and Village areas of the campus are located on the west side. The two sides of campus are connected both by a bridge over, and a tunnel (Duke Dog Alley) underneath, Interstate 81.[36] Other unique features on the campus include Newman Lake, a 9.7-acre (39,000?m2) body of water located in the Lake Area next to Greek Row and Sonner Hall,[37] and the Edith J. Carrier Arboretum, a 125-acre urban botanical preserve located within the city of Harrisonburg and the campus of James Madison University (JMU). The Edith J. Carrier Arboretum combines naturalized botanical gardens (33 acres) and forest (92 acres), and is the only arboretum on a public university campus in Virginia.\\r\\nThe original, historic \\"Bluestone\\" side of campus is situated on South Main Street (also known as U.S. Route 11, and historically as \\"The Valley Pike\\"). Since the late 1990s the campus has expanded both east and west of the Bluestone area. Towards the east, across Interstate 81, the expansion has included The College of Integrated Science and Technology (CISAT), the University Recreation Center (UREC), the Festival Conference and Student Center, the Leeolou Alumni Center, several residence halls, the Chemistry and Physics Building, and University Park, which opened in 2012 off of Port Republic Road, combining recreational and varsity athletic fields. The Rose Library, completed in August 2008, serves as a repository of science and technical material.[38]\\r\\nSeveral new construction projects on the campus of James Madison University were included in Governor Tim Kaine's $1.65 billion higher education bond package. Governor Kaine's proposal designated more than $96 million for JMU projects. Among the projects included were the construction of a new biotechnology building, Centennial Hall ($44.8 million) and the renovation and expansion of Duke Hall ($43.4 million). The proposal also included $8.6 million as the final installment payment for the purchase of Rockingham Memorial Hospital.[39] Beginning in 2002 JMU began receiving state and private funding to construct a state-of-the-art performing arts complex. The facility is located opposite Wilson Hall across South Main Street, and serves to visually complete the Main Quad. It was named \\"The Forbes Center for the Performing Arts\\" in honor of Bruce and Lois Forbes who provided a gift of $5 million towards the project. The wing of The Forbes Center dedicated to theater and dance is named the \\"Dorothy Thomasson Estes Center for Theatre and Dance\\" in honor of a $2.5 million gift by the husband of Dorothy Estes. The wing dedicated to music is named the \\"Shirley Hanson Roberts Center for Music Performance\\" in honor of a multimillion-dollar gift from the husband of Shirley Roberts. The entire PAC was built at a total cost exceeding $92 million, and opened in June 2010 to house academic offices and performances by the Schools of Theatre, Dance and Music, and the administrative offices of the College of Visual and Performing Arts.[40]\\r\\nWilson Hall is the centerpiece of the university's main quadrangle. It contains an auditorium, administrative offices, and the Community Service Learning Office. The building's cupola has been featured on the university logo, letterhead, and other university stationery and postcards. Completed in 1931, the building was named after President Woodrow Wilson, who was born in nearby Staunton, Virginia.\\r\\nBus service around campus and the city is provided by the Harrisonburg Department of Public Transportation.\\r\\nThe Princeton Review also recognized James Madison as one of 81 schools in America \\"with a conscience\\", and in the latest year ranked JMU second in the nation behind only the University of Virginia in the number of Peace Corps volunteers it sent from its student body among \\"medium-sized\\" universities.[41] And in 2010, the food at JMU was ranked third in the United States.[42] In 2011 the student body was ranked 20th happiest in the entire nation by Newsweek and The Daily Beast.[43] In 2009, Playboy ranked JMU as the 22nd Best Party School in the nation. These rankings take into consideration the surrounding area's activities, academics, as well as the social scene on campus.\\r\\nThe school has 35 residence halls, ten of which serve as sorority houses.[44] While most residence halls are only for housing, several halls also provide auxiliary services. For example, Chandler Hall, located in the Lake area, offers a basement dining facility and a computer lab.[45] All freshmen must live on campus, and a large portion of JMU's on-campus housing is set aside for incoming students. Consequently, most upperclassmen and graduate students live off campus. Continuing students who wish to live on campus must re-apply for housing each year. While occasional exceptions are granted, generally freshmen are not granted on-campus parking permits.[46] Some JMU halls are set-aside as specialized living and learning residential communities. Shenandoah Hall is devoted as an Honors residential experience, Chesapeake Hall is for pre-professional health disciplines, Gifford Hall includes the Roop Learning Community for future teachers, and Wayland Hall is reserved for majors in the art disciplines.\\r\\nJames Madison University has over 350 clubs and organizations for students to choose from. The goal is to provide students with a unique experience that will help them to grow in community and in engagement outside of the classroom.[47]\\r\\nThe Student Government Association was founded in 1915 and stood as the first organization on campus. Their mission is to be an organization dedicated to collaborating with all members of the JMU community and to be advocates for student opinion while fostering a proactive, inclusive environment.\\r\\nJames Madison University has the largest collegiate marching band in the nation, with 460 members as of Fall 2016. Nicknamed \\"Virginia's Finest\\", the Marching Royal Dukes have performed at venues such as the inaugurations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, the NFC title game between Washington and Dallas in 1983, Bands of America Grand National Championships in 1988 and 1991. The band has made three appearances in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, first in 2001, again in 2008, and most recently in 2013. In the past decade, the band has taken trips to Europe during the school's winter break, featuring Athens, Dublin, Monaco, London, and Rome.[48] During their most recent trip to Europe, the MRDs participated in the 2015 Italian New Year's Day Parade in the Vatican.\\r\\nThe James Madison Speech Team has been recognized by AFA-NIET as one of the top 20 intercollegiate speech teams in the nation. JMU Forensics is the only program in the nation directed by two recipients of AFA's most respected coaching awards: Distinguished Service and Outstanding New Coach.[49]\\r\\nThe Breeze is a student-run newspaper serving James Madison University since 1922. Since then, the newspaper has provided news and information to the university community. The Breeze publishes 7,000 copies every Thursday and maintains an online website, mobile app and a Twitter and Facebook page.

The men's program has an extensive tradition of winning, most notably National Championships in 1999, 2000 & 2009. Similarly, the women have won National Championships in 2009 & 2012. Both the men's and women's teams are involved in campus philanthropy, including annual community fundraisers, as well as responsibility for the upkeep of roadways through the Adopt-a-Highway program. The men's team is especially found of Zaxbys chicken and long walks on the quad.\\r\\nThe JMU Men's Ultimate team, the Flying Hellfish, was founded in 1997 by Rohit Setty and Rob Knapik.[50] The team is named after the Simpsons episode 22, season 7, \\"Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'\\"[51][52] Since 2005, the team has hosted an annual tournament known as \\"The Hellfish Bonanza,\\" which attracts between 12 and 16 teams from across the east coast.[51] Several current and former Hellfish play Ultimate professionally for Major League Ultimate's Washington DC Current, including Lloyd Blake, Ben Fleming, Eric \\"Astro\\" Minor,[53] Andrew \\"Peanut\\" Ferraro, and Matthew \\"Cam\\" Barnhardt.[54]\\r\\nLike all public universities in Virginia, James Madison is governed by a Board of Visitors appointed by the Governor of Virginia.[55] In addition to the 15 members appointed by the governor, the speaker of the Faculty Senate and an elected student representative serve as representatives for the faculty and the student body respectively. The appointed members serve for a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms, while the student representative is limited to two one-year terms. The faculty representative serves for as long as he or she remains the speaker of the JMU Faculty Senate.[55]\\r\\nJonathan R. Alger is the sixth and current president of the university. Before being named president, Alger served as the senior vice president and counsel at Rutgers University.[56]\\r\\nJames Madison University's athletic teams are known as the \\"Dukes.\\" An English bulldog, with crown and cape, and the Duke Dog, a gray bulldog costume in a purple cape and crown, serve as the school's mascot. The \\"Dukes\\" nickname is in honor of Samuel Page Duke, the university's second president. The school colors are royal purple and gold. Madison competes in the NCAA's Division I in the Colonial Athletic Association and the Eastern College Athletic Conference. For football, they are in the NCAA's Football Championship Subdivision.[57] Over 415 varsity athletes compete in football, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's tennis, women's swimming and diving, women's volleyball, baseball, women's lacrosse, field hockey, men's and women's golf, women's cross country and track and field, and softball. James Madison's two national championships are tied for third most national titles by a college or university in Virginia. James Madison's baseball team advanced to the College World Series in 1983, becoming the first Virginia school to do so. The JMU women's field hockey team won the university's first national title in 1994. JMU football won the NCAA Division I-AA national title in 2004, with a 13ÿ2 record, and in 2016 with a 14-1 record going undefeated in the FCS. They are the only team in history to win the title after playing four straight road playoff games. Since 2004, the JMU football team has appeared in the playoffs in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\\r\\nJames Madison University invested heavily in new athletic facilities throughout the tenure of President Linwood Rose. JMU built a new multimillion-dollar baseball and softball field complex that opened in 2010. Additionally, after the last football game of 2009, the university began an expansion of Bridgeforth Stadium that increased seating capacity to approximately 25,000. Construction was completed in time for the 2011 football season.[58]\\r\\nIn 2012, the James Madison Women's Basketball team won a club record 29 games, and advanced to the WNIT National Championship game, where it lost to Oklahoma State University. The Lady Dukes defeated Wake Forest, Davidson College, Virginia, South Florida and Syracuse prior to falling to Oklahoma State. In 2013, head coach Kenny Brooks led his team back to the WNIT defeating NC A&T, NC State, and Fordham before falling to Florida in the tournament's quarterfinals. In 2014, the Lady Dukes posted an overall 29ÿ6 record that culminated with a 85ÿ69 loss to Texas A&M University in the NCAA Championship Round of 32. This marked the ninth consecutive year that the Lady Dukes participated in postseason play and the program's ninth consecutive season with 20 victories, a school record.\\r\\nIn 2013, James Madison University's Men's Basketball team won the CAA championship title for the first time since 1994. The Dukes then won their first NCAA tournament game in 30 years, defeating Long Island University-Brooklyn. The Dukes fell to Indiana in the second round, 83-62, finishing the season with a 21ÿ15 record.[59]\\r\\nJames Madison University is home to the John C. Wells Planetarium. The planetarium first opened at JMU in 1956 under the direction of Dr. John C. Wells, head of the Physics Department. The facility was then moved to Miller Hall and renovated in 1975, later named in honor of Wells on the occasion of his retirement in 1980.[60]\\r\\nThe planetarium seats 72 individuals within a 30-ft dome. It features a GOTO Chronos star projector together with Evans & Sutherland Digistar 5 digital projectors.[61] The John C. Wells Planetarium also employs students enrolled at James Madison University to operate the system and host shows to the public.\\r\\nIn the early years of the Miller Hall Planetarium, not yet named after Dr. John Wells, all laboratories in the General Studies astronomy course met in the planetarium as well as other astronomy classes such as \\"Controversies in Astronomy\\" and \\"Planetary Astronomy\\".[60] As the Planetarium grew older, it began scheduling astronomy instruction for off-campus groups. The planetarium also hosts regular public shows and special events such as Starry Nights Harrisonburg, Space Explorers Camp, and Bad Science Movie Nights as well.[62]\\r\\nCoordinates: 382618.4N 785225.5W? / ?38.438444N 78.873750W? / 38.438444; -78.873750","input":"What is the mascot of james madison university?"},{"output":"Peter Mottershead","context":"Everest Home Improvement (Everest Ltd) is a British double glazing and home improvement company.[1] Peter Mottershead is the company's CEO.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Everest was founded and became one of the first companies in the market of double glazing.[1] In what became a very fragmented market,[3] with over 3,000 companies,[1] the company grew to become the second biggest in the UK market by sales[1] and turnover[3] with 2.5% of the market (S165m sales) by 2009,[1] later rising to 3%.[3]\\r\\nPrivate Equity firm Better Capital acquired the company in March 2012 for S25 million.[4] In November 2013, the company won the Interactive Media Awards in content, design, functionality, high standards of compliance and usability.[5][6]\\r\\nIn 2014, Everest windows introduced triple glazing to the volume market.[7][8]\\r\\nEverest Windows were awarded Sales Team of the Year runner up and Sales Director of the Year runner up at the British Excellence in Sales & Marketing Awards in March 2015.[9]\\r\\nThe company is headquartered in Cuffley, Hertfordshire and has manufacturing plants in Sittingbourne, Kent and Treherbert, Wales and [1][2] employs its own product development team, design team, installation team and sales team.

Brahmins, states Olivelle, were the social class from which most ascetics came.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dharmasutras and Dharmasatras text of Hinduism describe the expectations, duties and role of Brahmins. The rules and duties in these Dharma texts of Hinduism, are primarily directed at Brahmins. The Gautama's Dharmasutra, the oldest of surviving Hindu Dharmasutras, for example, states in verse 9.54ÿ9.55 that a Brahmin should not participate or perform a ritual unless he is invited to do so, but he may attend. Gautama outlines the following rules of conduct for a Brahmin, in Chapters 8 and 9:[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nGautama Dharmasutra 9.24ÿ9.25[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8 of the Dharmasutra, states Olivelle, asserts the functions of a Brahmin to be to learn the Vedas, the secular sciences, the Vedic supplements, the dialogues, the epics and the Puranas; to understand the texts and pattern his conduct according to precepts contained in this texts, to undertake Sanskara (rite of passage) and rituals, and lead a virtuous life.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe text lists eight virtues that a Brahmin must inculcate: compassion, patience, lack of envy, purification, tranquility, auspicious disposition, generosity and lack of greed, and then asserts in verse 9.24ÿ9.25, that it is more important to lead a virtuous life than perform rites and rituals, because virtue leads to achieving liberation (moksha, a life in the world of Brahman).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe later Dharma texts of Hinduism such as Baudhayana Dharmasutra add charity, modesty, refraining from anger and never being arrogant as duties of a Brahmin.[18] The Vasistha Dharmasutra in verse 6.23 lists discipline, austerity, self-control, liberality, truthfulness, purity, Vedic learning, compassion, erudition, intelligence and religious faith as characteristics of a Brahmin.[19] In 13.55, the Vasistha text states that a Brahmin must not accept weapons, poison or liquor as gifts.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dharmasastras such as Manusmriti, like Dharmsutras, are codes primarily focussed on how a Brahmin must live his life, and their relationship with a king and warrior class.[21] Manusmriti dedicates 1,034 verses, the largest portion, on laws for and expected virtues of Brahmins.[22] It asserts, for example,\\r\\n\\r\\nA well disciplined Brahmin, although he knows just the Savitri verse, is far better than an undisciplined one who eats all types of food and deals in all types of merchandise though he may know all three Vedas.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Bussanich states that the ethical precepts set for Brahmins, in ancient Indian texts, are similar to Greek virtue-ethics, that \\"Manu's dharmic Brahmin can be compared to Aristotle's man of practical wisdom\\",[24] and that \\"the virtuous Brahmin is not unlike the Platonic-Aristotelian philosopher\\" with the difference that the latter was not sacerdotal.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Abraham Eraly, \\"Brahmin as a varna hardly had any presence in historical records before the Gupta Empire era\\" (3rd century to 6th century CE), and \\"no Brahmin, no sacrifice, no ritualistic act of any kind ever, even once, is referred to in any Indian text\\" dated to be from the first century CE or before.[26] Their role as priests and repository of sacred knowledge, as well as their importance in the practice of Vedic Shrauta rituals grew during the Gupta Empire era and thereafter.[26] However, the knowledge about actual history of Brahmins or other varnas of Hinduism in and after 1st-millennium is fragmentary and preliminary, with little that is from verifiable records or archeological evidence, and much that is constructed from a-historical Sanskrit works and fiction. Michael Witzel writes,\\r\\n\\r\\nToward a history of the Brahmins: Current research in the area is fragmentary. The state of our knowledge of this fundamental subject is preliminary, at best. Most Sanksrit works are a-historic or, at least, not especially interested in presenting a chronological account of India's history. When we actually encounter history, such as in Rajatarangini or in the Gopalavamsavali of Nepal, the texts do not deal with brahmins in great detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gautama Dharmasutra states in verse 10.3 that it is obligatory on a Brahmin to learn and teach the Vedas.[28] Chapter 10 of the text, according to Olivelle translation, states that he may impart Vedic instructions to a teacher, relative, friend, elder, anyone who offers exchange of knowledge he wants, or anyone who pays for such education.[28] The Chapter 10 adds that a Brahmin may also engage in agriculture, trade, lend money on interest, while Chapter 7 states that a Brahmin may engage in the occupation of a warrior in the times of adversity.[28][29] Typically, asserts Gautama Dharmasutra, a Brahmin should accept any occupation to sustain himself but avoid the occupations of a Shudra, but if his life is at stake a Brahmin may sustain himself by accepting occupations of a Shudra.[29] The text forbids a Brahmin from engaging in the trade of animals for slaughter, meat, medicines and milk products even in the times of adversity.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Apastamba Dharmasutra asserts in verse 1.20.10 that trade is generally not sanctioned for Brahmins, but in the times of adversity he may do so.[30] The chapter 1.20 of Apastamba, states Olivelle, forbids the trade of the following under any circumstances: human beings, meat, skins, weapons, barren cows, sesame seeds, pepper, and merits.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1st millennium CE Dharmasastras, that followed the Dharmasutras contain similar recommendations on occupations for a Brahmin, both in prosperous or normal times, and in the times of adversity.[31] The widely studied Manusmriti, for example, states:\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept during a time of adversity, a Brahmin ought to sustain himself by following a livelihood that causes little or no harm to creatures. He should gather wealth just sufficient for his subsistence through irreproachable activities that are specific to him, without fatiguing his body. ÿ 4.2ÿ4.3\\r\\n\\r\\nHe must never follow a worldly occupation for the sake of livelihood, but subsist by means of a pure, upright and honest livelihood proper to a Brahmin. One who seeks happiness should become supremely content and self controlled, for happiness is rooted in contentment and its opposite is the root of unhappiness. ÿ 4.11ÿ4.12\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin's occupation must never involve forbidden activities such as producing or trading poison, weapons, meat, trapping birds and others.[33] It also lists six occupations that it deems proper for a Brahmin: teaching, studying, offering yajna, officiating at yajna, giving gifts and accepting gifts.[33] Of these, states Manusmriti, three which provide a Brahmin with a livelihood are teaching, officiating at yajna, and accepting gifts.[34] The text states that teaching is best, and ranks the accepting of gifts as the lowest of the six.[33] In the times of adversity, Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin may live by engaging in the occupations of the warrior class, or agriculture or cattle herding or trade.[34] Of these, Manusmriti in verses 10.83ÿ10.84 recommends a Brahmin should avoid agriculture if possible because, according to Olivelle translation, agriculture \\"involves injury to living beings and dependence of others\\" when the plow digs the ground and injures the creatures that live in the soil.[34][35] However, adds Manusmriti, even in the times of adversity, a Brahmin must never trade or produce poison, weapons, meat, soma, liquor, perfume, milk and milk products, molasses, captured animals or birds, beeswax, sesame seeds or roots.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical records, state scholars, suggest that Brahmin varna was not limited to a particular status or priest and teaching profession.[3][5][39] Historical records from mid 1st millennium CE and later, suggest Brahmins were agriculturalists and warriors in medieval India, quite often instead of as exception.[3][5] Donkin and other scholars state that Hoysala Empire records frequently mention Brahmin merchants \\"carried on trade in horses, elephants and pearls\\" and transported goods throughout medieval India before the 14th-century.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pali Canon depicts Brahmins as the most prestigious and elite non-Buddhist figures.[39] They mention them parading their learning. The Pali Canon and other Buddhist texts such as the Jataka Tales also record the livelihood of Brahmins to have included being farmers, handicraft workers and artisans such as carpentry and architecture.[39][42] Buddhist sources extensively attest, state Greg Bailey and Ian Mabbett, that Brahmins were \\"supporting themselves not by religious practice, but employment in all manner of secular occupations\\", in the classical period of India.[39] Some of the Brahmin occupations mentioned in the Buddhist texts such as Jatakas and Sutta Nipata are very lowly.[39] The Dharmasutras too mention Brahmin farmers.[39][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Haidar and Sardar, in the Islamic sultanates of the Deccan region, and unlike the Mughal Empire, Telugu Niyogi Brahmins served the Muslim sultans in many different roles such as accountants, ministers, revenue administration and in judicial service.[44] The Deccan sultanates also heavily recruited Marathi Brahmins at different levels of their administration[45] During the days of Maratha Empire in the 17th and 18th century, the occupation of Marathi Brahmins ranged from administration, being warriors to being de facto rulers[46][47]\\r\\nAfter the collapse of Maratha empire, Brahmins in Maharashtra region were quick to take advantage of opportunities opened up by the new British rulers.They were the first community to take up Western education and therefore dominated lower level of British administration in the 19th century[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nEric Bellman states that during the Islamic Mughal Empire era Brahmins served as advisers to the Mughals, later to the British Raj.[49] The East India Company recruited from the Brahmin communities of the present day Uttar pradesh and Bihar regions for the Bengal army[50] Many Brahmins, in other parts of South Asia lived like other varna, engaged in all sorts of professions. Among Nepalese Hindus, for example, Niels Gutschow and Axel Michaels report the actual observed professions of Brahmins from 18th- to early 20th-century included being temple priests, minister, merchants, farmers, potters, masons, carpenters, coppersmiths, stone workers, barbers, gardeners among others.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther 20th-century surveys, such as in the state of Uttar Pradesh, recorded that the primary occupation of almost all Brahmin families surveyed was neither priestly nor Vedas-related, but like other varnas, ranged from crop farming (80 per cent of Brahmins), dairy, service, labour such as cooking, and other occupations.[52][53] The survey reported that the Brahmin families involved in agriculture as their primary occupation in modern times plough the land themselves, many supplementing their income by selling their labor services to other farmers.[52][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins, a movement that encouraged a direct relationship of an individual with a personal god.[55][56] Among the many Brahmins who nurtured the Bhakti movement were Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Madhvacharya of Vaishnavism,[56] Ramananda, another devotional poet sant.[57][58] Born in a Brahmin family,[57][59] Ramananda welcomed everyone to spiritual pursuits without discriminating anyone by gender, class, caste or religion (such as Muslims).[59][60][61] He composed his spiritual message in poems, using widely spoken vernacular language rather than Sanskrit, to make it widely accessible. His ideas also influenced the founders of Sikhism in 15th century, and his verses and he are mentioned in the Sikh scripture Adi Granth.[62] The Hindu tradition recognises him as the founder of the Hindu Ramanandi Sampradaya,[63] the largest monastic renunciant community in Asia in modern times.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther medieval era Brahmins who led spiritual movement without social or gender discrimination included Andal (9th-century female poet), Basava (12th-century Lingayatism), Dnyaneshwar (13th-century Bhakti poet), Vallabha Acharya (16th-century Vaishnava poet), among others.[66][67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany 18th and 19th century Brahmins are credited with religious movements that criticised idolatry. For example, the Brahmins Raja Ram Mohan Roy led Brahmo Samaj and Dayananda Saraswati led the Arya Samaj.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 2007 reports, Brahmins in India are about five percent of its total population.[49][71] The Himalayan states of Uttarakhand (20%) and Himachal Pradesh (14%) have the highest percentage of Brahmin population relative to respective state's total Hindus.[71] Also, the participation of Brahmins in present government is very high.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, an estimated 65 percent of the Brahmin households in India, with about 40 million people, lived on less than $100 a month in 2004; this number dropped to about 50% in 2007.[49] Brahmins have also included wealthier and politically successful members.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Brahmin appears extensively in ancient and medieval Sutras and commentary texts of Buddhism and Jainism. In Buddhist Pali Canon, such as the Majjhima Nikaya and Devadaha Sutta, first written down about 1st century BCE,[73] the Buddha is attributed to be mentioning Jain Brahmins and ascetics, as he describes their karma doctrine and ascetic practices:[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blessed One [Buddha] said,\\r\\n\\"There are, o monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who speak thus and are of such opinion: 'Whatever a particular person experiences, whether pleasant or painful, or neither pleasant nor painful, all this has (...) Thus say, o monks, those free of bonds [Jainas].\\r\\n\\"O Niganthas, you?... \\r\\n\\r\\nModern scholars state that such usage of the term Brahmin in ancient texts does not imply a caste, but simply \\"masters\\" (experts), guardian, recluse, preacher or guide of any tradition.[76][77][78] An alternate synonym for Brahmin in the Buddhist and other non-Hindu tradition is Mahano.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Brahmins formed an influential group in Burmese Buddhist kingdoms in 18th- and 19th-century. The court Brahmins were locally called Punna.[81] During the Konbaung dynasty, Buddhist kings relied on their court Brahmins to consecrate them to kingship in elaborate ceremonies, and to help resolve political questions.[81] This role of Hindu Brahmins in a Buddhist kingdom, states Leider, may have been because Hindu texts provide guidelines for such social rituals and political ceremonies, while Buddhist texts don't.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brahmins were also consulted in the transmission, development and maintenance of law and justice system outside India.[81] Hindu Dharmasastras, particularly Manusmriti written by the Brahmin Manu, states Anthony Reid,[82] were \\"greatly honored in Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of law and order, which kings were obliged to uphold. They were copied, translated and incorporated into local law code, with strict adherence to the original text in Burma and Siam, and a stronger tendency to adapt to local needs in Java (Indonesia)\\".[82][83][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mythical origins of Cambodia are credited to a Brahmin prince named Kaundinya, who arrived by sea, married a Naga princess living in the flooded lands.[85][86] Kaudinya founded Kambuja-desa, or Kambuja (transliterated to Kampuchea or Cambodia). Kaundinya introduced Hinduism, particularly Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), and these ideas grew in southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrahmins have been part of the Royal tradition of Thailand, particularly for the consecration and to mark annual land fertility rituals of Buddhist kings. A small Brahmanical temple Devasathan, established in 1784 by King Rama I of Thailand, has been managed by ethnically Thai Brahmins ever since.[87] The temple hosts Phra Phikhanesuan (Ganesha), Phra Narai (Narayana, Vishnu), Phra Itsuan (Shiva), Uma, Brahma, Indra (Sakka) and other Hindu deities.[87] The tradition asserts that the Thai Brahmins have roots in Hindu holy city of Varanasi and southern state of Tamil Nadu, go by the title Pandita, and the various annual rites and state ceremonies they conduct has been a blend of Buddhist and Hindu rituals. The coronation ceremony of the Thai king is almost entirely conducted by the royal Brahmins.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\n??? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ?\\r\\n???? ???? ???? ?? ???? ?? ??? ???? ??????? ???? \\r\\n????????? ???? ????? ????? ???? ??????? ???? ?\\r\\n??? ??? ???? ??? ?????? ???????? ?????? ????? ????\\r\\n11 When they divided Puru?a how many portions did they make?\\r\\nWhat do they call his mouth, his arms?

Founded on June 20, 1325, it was the capital of the expanding Aztec Empire in the 15th century[1] until it was captured by the Spanish in 1521.\\r\\nAt its peak, it was the largest city in the Pre-Columbian Americas. It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Today, the ruins of Tenochtitlan are in the historic center of Mexico City.\\r\\nTenochtitlan was one of two Nahua ltpetl (city-states) on the island, the other being Tlatelolco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, the name Tenochtitlan was thought to come from Nahuatl tetl [?tet?] (\\"rock\\") and nchtli [?no?t?t?i] (\\"prickly pear\\") and is often thought to mean, \\"Among the prickly pears [growing among] rocks\\". However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as \\"the Bancroft dialogues\\" suggest the second vowel was short, so that the true etymology remains uncertain.[2]\\r\\nTenochtitlan covered an estimated 8 to 13.5?km2 (3.1 to 5.2?sq?mi), situated on the western side of the shallow Lake Texcoco.\\r\\nAt the time of Spanish conquests, Mexico City comprised both Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco. The city extended from north to south, from the north border of Tlatelolco to the swamps, which by that time were gradually disappearing to the west; the city ended more or less at the present location of Avenida Bucareli.\\r\\nThe city was connected to the mainland by causeways leading to the north, south, and west. The causeways were interrupted by bridges that allowed canoes and other water traffic to pass freely. The bridges could be pulled away, if necessary, to defend the city. The city was interlaced with a series of canals, so that all sections of the city could be visited either on foot or via canoe.\\r\\nLake Texcoco was the largest of five interconnected lakes. Since it formed in an endorheic basin, Lake Texcoco was brackish. During the reign of Moctezuma I, the \\"levee of Nezahualcoyotl\\" was constructed, reputedly designed by Nezahualcoyotl. Estimated to be 12 to 16?km (7.5 to 9.9?mi) in length, the levee was completed circa 1453. The levee kept fresh spring-fed water in the waters around Tenochtitlan and kept the brackish waters beyond the dike, to the east.\\r\\nTwo double aqueducts, each more than 4?km (2.5?mi) long and made of terracotta,[3] provided the city with fresh water from the springs at Chapultepec. This was intended mainly for cleaning and washing. For drinking, water from mountain springs was preferred. Most of the population liked to bathe twice a day; Moctezuma was said to take four baths a day. According to the context of Aztec culture in literature, the soap that they most likely used was the root of a plant called copalxocotl (Saponaria americana),[4] and to clean their clothes they used the root of metl (Agave americana). Also, the upper classes and pregnant women washed themselves in a temazcalli, similar to a sauna bath, which is still used in the south of Mexico. This was also popular in other Mesoamerican cultures.\\r\\nWhen we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments (...) on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water, and all built of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream? (...) I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about.\\r\\nThe city was divided into four zones, or camps; each camp was divided into 20 districts (calpullis, Nahuatl calplli); and each calpulli, or 'big house', was crossed by streets or tlaxilcalli. There were three main streets that crossed the city, each leading to one of the three causeways to the mainland of Tepeyac, Ixtapalpa, and Tlacopan.[6] Bernal Daz del Castillo reported that they were wide enough for ten horses. Surrounding the raised causeways were artificial floating gardens with canal waterways and gardens of plants, shrubs, and trees.[7] The calpullis were divided by channels used for transportation, with wood bridges that were removed at night.\\r\\nThe earliest European images of the city were woodcuts published in Augsburg around 1522.[8]\\r\\nEach calpulli (from Classical Nahuatl calplli, Nahuatl pronunciation: [ka??po?l?i], meaning \\"large house\\") had its own tiyanquiztli (marketplace), but there was also a main marketplace in Tlatelolco ÿ Tenochtitlan's sister city. Corts estimated it was twice the size of the city of Salamanca with about 60,000 people trading daily. Bernardino de Sahag~n provides a more conservative population estimate of 20,000 on ordinary days and 40,000 on feast days. There were also specialized markets in the other central Mexican cities.\\r\\nIn the center of the city were the public buildings, temples, and palaces. Inside a walled square, 500 meters to a side, was the ceremonial center. There were about 45 public buildings, including: the Templo Mayor, which was dedicated to the Aztec patron deity Huitzilopochtli and the Rain God Tlaloc; the temple of Quetzalcoatl; the tlachtli (ball game court) with the tzompantli or rack of skulls; the Sun Temple, which was dedicated to Tonatiuh; the Eagle's House, which was associated with warriors and the ancient power of rulers; the platforms for the gladiatorial sacrifice; and some minor temples.[9]\\r\\nOutside was the palace of Moctezuma with 100 rooms, each with its own bath, for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people. Also located nearby was the cuicalli, or house of the songs, and the calmecac.[10]\\r\\nThe city had great symmetry. All constructions had to be approved by the calmimilocatl, a functionary in charge of the city planning.\\r\\nThe palace of Moctezuma II also had two houses or zoos, one for birds of prey and another for other birds, reptiles, and mammals. About 300 people were dedicated to the care of the animals.\\r\\nThere was also a botanical garden and an aquarium. The aquarium had ten ponds of salt water and ten ponds of fresh water, containing various fish and aquatic birds. Places like this also existed in Texcoco, Chapultepec, Huaxtepec (now called Oaxtepec), and Texcotzingo.[11]\\r\\nTenochtitlan can be considered the most complex society in Mesoamerica in regard to social stratification. The complex system involved many social classes. The macehualtin were commoners who lived outside the island city of Tenochtitlan. The pipiltin were noblemen who were relatives of leaders and former leaders, and lived in the confines of the island. Cuauhipiltin, or eagle nobles, were commoners who impressed the nobles with their martial prowess, and were treated as nobles.[6] Teteuctin were the highest class, rulers of various parts of the empire, including the king. Tlacohtin were individuals who chose to enslave themselves to pay back a debt; they were not slaves forever and were not treated as badly as typical slaves seen in other ancient civilizations worldwide. Finally, the pochteca were merchants who traveled all of Mesoamerica trading. The membership of this class was based on heredity. Pochteca could become very rich because they did not pay taxes, but they had to sponsor the ritual feast of Xocotl Huetzi from the wealth that they obtained from their trade expeditions.\\r\\nStatus was displayed by location and type of house where a person lived. Ordinary people lived in houses made of reeds plastered with mud and roofed with thatch. People who were better off had houses of adobe brick with flat roofs.[6] The wealthy had houses of stone masonry with flat roofs. They most likely made up the house complexes that were arranged around the inner court. The higher officials in Tenochtitlan lived in the great palace complexes that made up the city.\\r\\nAdding even more complexity to Aztec social stratification was the calpolli. Calpolli, meaning big house is a group of families related by either kinship or proximity. These groups consist of both elite members of Aztec society and commoners. Elites provided commoners with arable land and nonagricultural occupations, and commoners performed services for chiefs and gave tribute.[12]\\r\\nTenochtitlan was the capital of the Mexican civilization of the Mexica people founded in 1325. The state religion of the Mexica civilization awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy: the wandering tribes would find the destined site for a great city whose location would be signaled by an eagle with a snake in its beak perched atop a (Opuntia) cactus.\\r\\nThe Mexica saw this vision on what was then a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco, a vision that is now immortalized in Mexico's coat of arms and on the Mexican flag. Not deterred by the unfavourable terrain, they set about building their city, using the chinampa system (misnamed as \\"floating gardens\\") for agriculture and to dry and expand the island.\\r\\nA thriving culture developed, and the Mexica civilization came to dominate other tribes around Mexico. The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica. Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and perhaps even the Inca Empire.[13]\\r\\nAfter a flood of Lake Texcoco, the city was rebuilt under the rule of Ahuitzotl in a style that made it one of the grandest ever in Mesoamerica.\\r\\nSpanish conquistador Hernn Corts arrived in Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519. With an estimated population between 200,000 and 300,000, many[who?] scholars believe Tenochtitlan to have been among the largest cities in the world at that time.[14] Compared to the cities of Europe, only Paris, Venice and Constantinople might have rivaled it. It was five times the size of the London of Henry VIII.[6] In a letter to the Spanish king, Corts wrote that Tenochtitlan was as large as Seville or C܇rdoba. Cortes' men were in awe at the sight of the splendid city and many wondered if they were dreaming.[15]\\r\\nAlthough some popular sources put the number as high as 350,000,[16] the most common estimates of the population are of over 200,000 people. One of the few comprehensive academic surveys of Mesoamerican city and town sizes arrived at a population of 212,500 living on 13.5?km2 (5.2?sq?mi),[17] It is also said that at one time, Moctezuma had rule over an empire of almost five million people in central and southern Mexico because he had extended his rule to surrounding territories to gain tribute and prisoners to sacrifice to the gods.[7]\\r\\nWhen Corts and his men arrived in Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma II, who precariously ruled over a large empire, chose to welcome Corts as an honored guest, rather than risk a war which might quickly be joined by aggrieved indigenous people. Moctezuma may have feared that Corts was the returning god Quetzalcoatl, because the Spanish arrival coincided with the close of an Aztec calendar cycle consistent with such a return. This claim is found in the Florenino Codex, among other early sources, and accepted as true in many later histories. However, some scholars doubt it.[18]\\r\\nAs Corts approached the great city of Tenochtitlan, the natives put on many events. One particular event was the most important of them all, the celebration of Toxcatl. This event was when the most prominent warriors of altepetl would dance in front of a huge statue of Huitzilopochtli. The Spanish leader, Pedro de Alvarado, who was left in charge, worried that this would be the day that the natives would plan a surprise attack on them. He captured three natives and began to torture them until they confessed that this was indeed true. There was no proof that the natives would attack the Spaniards during this festival, however, Alvarado would plan an attack first by following an old maxim by deciding that the person who would attack first would be successful in this attack. During the festival, the Spaniards came heavily armed and closed off every exit surrounding the courtyard so that no one would escape. This would happen during their last days in Tenochtitlan.[19].\\r\\nNobles lined each side along the buildings of the city's main causeway, which extended about a league. Walking down the center came Moctezuma II, who had two lords at his side, one being his brother, the ruler of Iztapalapa. Corts dismounted, and was greeted by the ruler and his lords, but was forbidden to touch him. Corts gave him a necklace of crystals, placing it over his neck.[20]\\r\\nThey were then brought to a large house that would serve as their home for their stay in the city. Once they were settled, Moctezuma himself sat down and spoke with Corts. The great ruler declared that anything that they needed would be theirs to have.[21] He was thrilled to have visitors of such stature. Although the Spaniards were seeking gold, Moctezuma expressed that he had very little of the sort, but all of it was to be given to Corts if he so desired it.[22]\\r\\nSince arriving in Tenochtitlan, Corts faced early trouble. Leaving a post in Vera Cruz, the officer left in charge received a letter from Qualpopoca, the leader of Almera, asking to become a vassal of the Spaniards. He requested that officers be sent to him so that he could confirm his submission. To reach the province, the officers would have to travel through hostile land. The officer in charge of Vera Cruz decided to send four officers to meet with Qualpopoca.[23]\\r\\nWhen they arrived, they were captured and two were killed, the other two escaping through the woods. Upon their return to Vera Cruz, the officer in charge was infuriated, and so led troops to storm Almera. Here they learned that Moctezuma was supposedly the one who commanded the officers to be executed.[24] Back in Tenochtitlan, Corts detained Moctezuma and questioned him endlessly.[25] Though no serious conclusions were made, this started the relationship between Moctezuma and the Spaniards on a bad note.[26]\\r\\nCorts subsequently besieged Tenochtitlan for 75 days, causing the inhabitants utter famine,[7] directed the systematic destruction and leveling of the city,[27] and began its rebuilding, despite opposition, with a central area designated for Spanish use (the traza). The outer Indian section, now dubbed San Juan Tenochtitlan, continued to be governed by the previous indigenous elite and was divided into the same subdivisions as before.[28]. While the people of Tenochtitlan were celebrating the few Spaniards who were not able to escape and were killed, the city was in great ruins. The people of Tenochtitlan were exposed to diseases from their enemy. A citizen who was exposed to these diseases would not feel it for the first 10 days, then the disease would spread throughout the body, causing many sores the remaining days. This consisted of pain in the body and high fever. People were weak to the point that they could not move, nor be able to obtain food and water. They couldn't cook or bury the remaining dead bodies from the conquest. The population of the people of Tenochtitlan began to starve and weaken. For the next 60 days, the amount of citizens that died, began to rise even higher.[29]\\r\\nTenochtitlan's main temple complex, the Templo Mayor, was dismantled and the central district of the Spanish colonial city was constructed on top of it. The great temple was destroyed by the Spanish during the construction of a cathedral. The location of the Templo Mayor was rediscovered in the early 20th century, but major excavations did not take place until 1978ÿ1982, after utility workers came across a massive stone disc depicting the nude dismembered body of the moon goddess Coyolxauhqui. This stone disc is 3.25 meters in diameter (or 10.5?ft).[30] These finds are held at the Templo Mayor Museum.\\r\\nThe ruins, constructed over seven periods, were built on top of each other. The resulting weight of the structures caused them to sink into the sediment of Lake Texcoco. This resulted in the ruins now resting at an angle instead of horizontally.\\r\\nMexico City's Z܇calo, the Plaza de la Constituci܇n, is located at the site of Tenochtitlan's original central plaza and market, and many of the original calzadas still correspond to modern city streets. The Aztec calendar stone was located in the ruins. This stone is 4 meters in diameter and weighs over 20 tons. It was once located half-way up the great pyramid. This sculpture was made around 1470 under the rule of King Axayacatl, the predecessor of Tizoc, and is said to tell the history of the Mexicas and a prophecy for the future.[31]\\r\\nIn August 1987, archaeologists discovered a mix of 1,789 human bones five metres below street level in Mexico City.[32] The burial dates back to the 1480s and lies at the foot of the main temple in the sacred ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital. The bones are from children, teenagers and adults and a complete skeleton of a young woman was also found at the site.[32]","input":"What was the capital city of the aztec empire?"},{"output":"Isla Escudo de Veraguas, a small island off the coast of Panama","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus), also known as the monk sloth or dwarf sloth, is a sloth endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas, a small island off the coast of Panama. The species was first described by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001. The pygmy three-toed sloth is significantly smaller than the other three members of its genus, but otherwise resembles the brown-throated three-toed sloth. According to Anderson and Handley Jr., the head-and-body length is between 48 and 53 centimetres (19 and 21?in), and the body mass ranges from 2.5 to 3.5?kg (5.5 to 7.7?lb).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sloth, like other sloths, is arboreal (tree-living) and feeds on leaves. It is symbiotically associated with green algae, that can provide it with a camouflage. Details of mating behavior and reproduction have not been documented. The pygmy three-toed sloth is found exclusively in the red mangroves of Isla Escudos de Veraguas, restricted to an area of 4.3 square kilometres (1.7?sq?mi). A 2012 census of pygmy three-toed sloths estimated the total population at 79. The IUCN lists the pygmy three-toed sloth as critically endangered and they are listed on the world's 100 most threatened species.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pygmy three-toed sloth was first described by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001. The researchers noted that the three-toed sloths endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas, a small island off the coast of Panama, are significantly smaller than those that occur on the nearby outer islands of Bocas del Toro Province. Moreover, they differ from other populations in terms of pelage and cranial characteristics. Hence, they considered the three-toed sloths in Isla Escudo de Veraguas to be an independent species and formally described it from the skin and skull of an adult female. The researchers further pointed out that Isla Escudos de Veraguas is the oldest island and located farthest from the mainland, that began breaking up into small islands due to rises in sea levels 10,000 years ago. They proposed that this species evolved from an isolated population that had originated from the mainland population of brown-throated three-toed sloths; it gradually differentiated enough to become an independent species through insular dwarfism.[2] In another study the following year, the researchers observed that the mean body size of three-toed sloths on an island decreases linearly as the age of the island increases; the area of the island and the distance from the mainland, however, do not appear to significantly affect dwarfing.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pygmy three-toed sloth is one of the four members of the genus Bradypus, and is classified under the family Bradypodidae.[4] A 2004 phylogenetic analysis suggested that Bradypus is sister to all other folivorans.[5] The generic name Bradypus is the combination of two Greek words: brady (\\"slow\\") and pous (\\"foot\\").[6] The specific name pygmaeus comes from the Greek pugmaios (\\"as small as a fist\\").[7] 'Monk sloth' and 'dwarf sloth' are two other names for this sloth.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pygmy three-toed sloth is significantly smaller than the other members of its genus, but otherwise resembles the brown-throated sloth. According to Anderson and Handley Jr., the head-and-body length is between 48 and 53 centimetres (19 and 21?in), and the body mass ranges from 2.5 to 3.5?kg (5.5 to 7.7?lb). The brown-throated sloth is nearly 40% heavier and 15% smaller in head-and-body length than the pygmy three-toed sloth. Moreover, the brown-throated sloth is lighter on the crown. The face is buff to tan; a dark band runs across the brow, surrounded by an orange patch. The throat is gray to brown, lighter than the underbelly; the dark brown back is spotted and has a dark stripe along the midline. Facial hair is short, while the long, rough hair on the crown and shoulders forms a hood. The grayish limbs have three claws each. The tail is 4.5 to 6 centimetres (1.8 to 2.4?in) long.[2][3][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have a relatively small and slender skull, with a large external auditory meatus, narrow squamosal and mandibular processes, a minuscule stylomastoid foramen, and usually lack foramina for the external carotid artery and anterodorsal (meaning in front and toward the back) nasopharynx. The dental formula of three-toed sloths is: 54ÿ5[10] Two of the teeth in each jaw are incisor-like, although those in the upper jaw are small or may be absent. Many of the features found in pygmy sloths are thought to be indicative of a relatively rapid evolution of a new species in an isolated, island habitat.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pygmy three-toed sloth is unique in that it is found exclusively in the red mangroves of Isla Escudos de Veraguas; the island has a small area of approximately 4.3 square kilometres (1.7?sq?mi). A 2012 census of pygmy three-toed sloths estimated the total population at 79 ÿ of which 70 occurred on mangroves and 9 in the surroundings. The population density was calculated as 5.8 per hectare. The total area occupied by mangroves on the island was estimated to be around 10.67 hectares (0.0412?sq?mi).[11] While their population has presumably always been low due to their restricted range, the 2012 census found far lower numbers than had been estimated (less than 500) by the IUCN in 2010.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IUCN lists the pygmy three-toed sloth as critically endangered; it is also listed in CITES Appendix II. According to the IUCN, conservation efforts are being hampered by conflict between local peoples and the government.[1] Threats to the sloth's survival include timber harvesting and human settlement, that might lead to habitat degradation.[13] Studies in 2010 and 2013 suggested a recent population bottleneck and decline in genetic variability.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pygmy three-toed sloth, like others in its genus, is an arboreal (tree-living) animal. This sloth can spend as many as 15 to 20 hours per day on trees. It moves at an extremely slow speed of 0.24 kilometres per hour (0.15?mph), making it one of the slowest animals.[14] The pygmy three-toed sloth is symbiotically related to green algae; a 2010 study investigated this in detail. Different sloths harbour different types of algae ÿ only Tricophilus species were found on the brown-throated and pygmy three-toed sloths. These algae discolor the fur of the sloth, giving it a greenish hue ÿ this serves as an efficient camouflage.[15] Some of these algae might be transferred to offspring through the mother, others may be picked up from the surroundings over time.[16] The smaller size of pygmy sloths reduces their energy requirements for survival and reproduction, making them an apparent example of insular dwarfism.[3] A BBC documentary, in which English naturalist Chris Packham recognizes the pygmy three-toed sloth as the first in his list of the top ten discoveries in the 2000s, shows a rare clip of a swimming pygmy three-toed sloth.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other sloths, the pygmy three-toed sloth feeds on leaves. It feeds on red mangrove leaves, which are relatively poor in nutrients and coarser than the tender leaves of Cecropia species eaten by brown-throated sloths on the mainland.[3] Details of mating behavior and reproduction have not been documented.[8]","input":"Where does the pygmy three toed sloth live?"},{"output":"as high as 300 gigahertz (GHz) to as low as 30 hertz (Hz)","context":"Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 gigahertz (GHz) to as low as 30 hertz (Hz).[1] At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm, and at 30 Hz is 10,000 km. Like all other electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at the speed of light.  They are generated by electric charges undergoing acceleration, such as time varying electric currents.[2]  Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects. \\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers, using antennas.   Radio waves are very widely used in modern technology for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and other navigation systems, communications satellites, wireless computer networks and many other applications. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth (ground waves), shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to earth beyond the horizon (skywaves), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight, so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent interference between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which defines radio waves as \\"electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily lower than 3?000?GHz, propagated in space without artificial guide\\".[3] The radio spectrum is divided into a number of radio bands on the basis of frequency, allocated to different uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves were first predicted by mathematical work done in 1867 by Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell.[4] Maxwell noticed wavelike properties of light and similarities in electrical and magnetic observations. His mathematical theory, now called Maxwell's equations, described light waves and radio waves as waves of electromagnetism that travel in space, radiated by a charged particle as it undergoes acceleration. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the reality of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating radio waves in his laboratory,[5] showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light:  standing waves, refraction, diffraction, and polarization.  Radio waves, originally called \\"Hertzian waves\\",[6] were first used for communication in the mid 1890s by Guglielmo Marconi, who developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers.  The modern term \\"radio wave\\" replaced the original name \\"Hertzian wave\\" around 1912.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light.[7][8] When passing through a material medium, they are slowed according to that object's permeability and permittivity.  Air is thin enough that in the Earth's atmosphere radio waves travel very close to the speed of light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wavelength is the distance from one peak of the wave's electric field (wave's peak/crest) to the next, and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave. The distance a radio wave travels in one second, in a vacuum, is 299,792,458 meters (983,571,056?ft) which is the wavelength of a 1 hertz radio signal. A 1 megahertz radio signal has a wavelength of 299.8 meters (984?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study of radio propagation, how radio waves move in free space and over the surface of the Earth, is vitally important in the design of practical radio systems.  Radio waves passing through different environments experience reflection, refraction, polarization, diffraction, and absorption.  Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, making certain radio bands more useful for specific purposes than others.  Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn radio communication systems, information is carried across space using radio waves.  At the sending end, the information to be sent, in the form of a time-varying electrical signal, is applied to a radio transmitter.[10]  The information signal can be an audio signal representing sound from a microphone, a video signal representing moving images from a video camera, or a digital signal representing data from a computer.  In the transmitter, an electronic oscillator generates an alternating current oscillating at a radio frequency, called the carrier because it serves to \\"carry\\" the information through the air.  The information signal is used to modulate the carrier, altering some aspect of it, \\"piggybacking\\" the information on the carrier.  The modulated carrier is amplified and applied to an antenna.  The oscillating current pushes the electrons in the antenna back and forth, creating oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves.  The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.[10]  This voltage is applied to the radio receiver, which extracts the information signal.  The receiver first uses a bandpass filter to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then amplifies the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a demodulator.  The recovered signal is sent to a loudspeaker or earphone to produce sound, or a television display screen to produce a visible image, or other devices.  A digital data signal is applied to a computer or microprocessor, which interacts with a human user.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other.  They can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words each transmitter has a different frequency, measured in kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).  The bandpass filter in the receiver consists of a tuned circuit which acts like a resonator, similarly to a tuning fork.[10]  It has a natural resonant frequency at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station.  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves are nonionizing radiation, which means they do not have enough energy to separate electrons from atoms or molecules, ionizing them, or break chemical bonds, causing chemical reactions or DNA damage.  The main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them, similarly to the infrared waves radiated by sources of heat such as a space heater or wood fire.  The oscillating electric field of the wave causes polar molecules to vibrate back and forth, increasing the temperature; this is how a microwave oven cooks food.  However, unlike infrared waves, which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating, radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues.   The depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency, and also depends on the material's resistivity and permittivity; it is given by a parameter called the skin depth of the material, which is the depth within which 63% of the energy is deposited.   For example, the 2.45?GHz radio waves (microwaves) in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately 2.5 to 3.8?cm (1 to 1.5 inches).   Radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of diathermy for deep heating of body tissue, to promote increased blood flow and healing.  More recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in hyperthermia treatment, to kill cancer cells.  Looking into a source of radio waves at close range, such as the waveguide of a working radio transmitter, can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating. A strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause cataracts.[11][12][13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the heating effect is in principle no different from other sources of heat, most research into possible health hazards of exposure to radio waves has focused on \\"nonthermal\\" effects; whether radio waves have any effect on tissues besides that caused by heating.      Electromagnetic radiation has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as \\"Possibly carcinogenic to humans\\".[16] The conceivable evidence of cancer risk via Personal exposure to RF-EMF with mobile telephone use was identified. [17]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves can be shielded against by a conductive metal sheet or screen, an enclosure of sheet or screen is called a Faraday cage.   A metal screen shields against radio waves as well as a solid sheet as long as the holes in the screen are smaller than about 1/20 of wavelength of the waves.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince radio frequency radiation has both an electric and a magnetic component, it is often convenient to express intensity of radiation field in terms of units specific to each component. The unit volts per meter (V/m) is used for the electric component, and the unit amperes per meter (A/m) is used for the magnetic component. One can speak of an electromagnetic field, and these units are used to provide information about the levels of electric and magnetic field strength at a measurement location.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother commonly used unit for characterizing an RF electromagnetic field is power density. Power density is most accurately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from the RF emitter to be located in what is referred to as the far field zone of the radiation pattern.[19] In closer proximity to the transmitter, i.e., in the \\"near field\\" zone, the physical relationships between the electric and magnetic components of the field can be complex, and it is best to use the field strength units discussed above. Power density is measured in terms of power per unit area, for example, milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2). When speaking of frequencies in the microwave range and higher, power density is usually used to express intensity since exposures that might occur would likely be in the far field zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nELF    3 Hz/100 Mm    30 Hz/10 Mm\\r\\n\\r\\nSLF   30 Hz/10 Mm    300 Hz/1 Mm\\r\\n\\r\\nULF  300 Hz/1 Mm       3 kHz/100 km\\r\\n\\r\\nVLF    3 kHz/100 km   30 kHz/10 km\\r\\n\\r\\nLF   30 kHz/10 km   300 kHz/1 km\\r\\n\\r\\nMF  300 kHz/1 km      3 MHz/100 m\\r\\n\\r\\nHF    3 MHz/100 m    30 MHz/10 m\\r\\n\\r\\nVHF   30 MHz/10 m    300 MHz/1 m\\r\\n\\r\\nUHF  300 MHz/1 m       3 GHz/100 mm\\r\\n\\r\\nSHF    3 GHz/100 mm   30 GHz/10 mm\\r\\n\\r\\nEHF   30 GHz/10 mm   300 GHz/1 mm\\r\\n\\r\\nTHF  300 GHz/1 mm      3 THz/0.1 mm","input":"What is the wave speed of radio waves?"},{"output":"southeastern","context":"","input":"What part of the country is florida in?"},{"output":"July 26, 2007","context":"Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake) is a river-like reservoir on the Colorado River in Austin, Texas, United States. The City of Austin created the reservoir in 1960 as a cooling pond for a new city power plant. The surface area of the lake is 416 acres (168?ha), and it is currently used primarily for recreation and flood control. The reservoir is named in honor of former First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson.[1]\\r\\nLady Bird Lake is the easternmost lake of a chain of reservoirs on the Colorado River, which is completely located in Texas, and should not be confused with the larger Colorado River located in the Southwestern United States . This chain, known locally as the Texas Highland Lakes, also includes Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, and Lake Austin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe City of Austin constructed Longhorn Dam in 1960 to form Town Lake. The city needed the reservoir to serve as a cooling pond for the Holly Street Power Plant, which operated from 1960 until 2007.[2]\\r\\nBefore 1971, the shoreline of Town Lake was mostly a mixture of weeds, unkempt bushes, and trash.[3] Local television station KTBC referred to the lake as an \\"eyesore.\\"[3] Some concerned Austinites had tried to clean up the lake, but the effort was only partly successful. During his two terms in office (1971ÿ75), the Mayor of Austin Roy Butler led the Austin City Council to establish the Town Lake Beautification Committee, and he appointed Lady Bird Johnson as the project's honorary chairman. Johnson's involvement brought attention and money (including $19,000 of her own) to the Town Lake project, allowing for the planting of hundreds of shrubs and trees.[4] The city also built a system of hike and bike trails along the shoreline of the lake.\\r\\nOn July 26, 2007, the Austin City Council passed a controversial resolution authorizing the renaming of the reservoir from Town Lake to Lady Bird Lake in honor of Lady Bird Johnson, who had died earlier that month.[5] Johnson had declined the honor of having the lake renamed for her while she was alive. In renaming the lake, the City Council recognized Johnson's dedication to beautifying the lake and her efforts to create a recreational trail system around the lake's shoreline.[6]\\r\\nIn 2009, non-profit organization Keep Austin Beautiful launched \\"Clean Lady Bird Lake\\".[7] The program mobilizes thousands of community volunteers annually to conduct large-scale cleanups along the lake every other month and targeted cleanups throughout the year.[8][9]\\r\\nLady Bird Lake is a major recreation area for the City of Austin. The lake's banks are bounded by the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, and businesses offer recreational watercraft services along the lakefront portion of the trail. Austin's largest downtown park, Zilker Park, is adjacent to the lake, and Barton Springs, a major attraction for swimmers, flows into the lake.\\r\\nThe City of Austin prohibits the operation of most motorized watercraft on Lady Bird Lake.[10] As a result, the lake serves as a popular recreational area for paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, dragon boats, and rowing shells. Austin's warm climate and the river's calm waters, nearly 6 miles (9.7?km) length and straight courses are especially popular with crew teams and clubs. Along with the University of Texas women's rowing team and coeducational club rowing team, who practice on Lady Bird Lake year-round, teams from northern universities (including the University of Chicago, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Nebraska) train on Lady Bird Lake during Christmas holidays and spring breaks.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther water sports along the shores of the lake include swimming in Deep Eddy Pool, the oldest swimming pool in Texas, and Barton Springs Pool, a natural pool on Barton Creek which flows into Lady Bird Lake. Below Tom Miller Dam is Red Bud Isle, a small island formed by the 1900 collapse of the McDonald Dam that serves as a recreation area with a dog park and access to the lake for canoeing and fishing.[11]\\r\\nSwimming in Lady Bird Lake is illegal due to poor water quality from the run-off from area streets and debris in the water from bridges and dams destroyed by floods in years past. The City of Austin enacted the ban in 1964, and the fine can be up to $500.[12]\\r\\nMusic venues on the banks of Lady Bird Lake are home to a number of events year-round, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the fall, the Austin Reggae Festival and Spamarama in the spring, and many open-air concerts at Auditorium Shores on the south bank and Fiesta Gardens on the north bank. The Austin Aqua Festival was held on the shores of Lady Bird Lake from 1962 until 1998.[citation needed] The late Austin resident and blues guitar legend, Stevie Ray Vaughan played a number of concerts at Auditorium Shores and is honored with a memorial statue on the south bank.\\r\\nThe Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, formerly the Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail, creates a complete circuit around Lady Bird Lake. It is one of the oldest urban Texas hike and bike paths. The trail is the longest trail designed for non-motorized traffic maintained by the City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department. A local nonprofit, The Trail Foundation, is the Trail's private steward and has made Trail-wide improvements by adding user amenities and infrastructure including trailheads and lakefront gathering areas, jewel box locally-designed restrooms, exercise equipment, as well as doing Trailwide ecological restoration work on an ongoing basis. The Butler Trail loop was completed in 2014 with the public-private partnership 1-mile Boardwalk project which was spearheaded by The Trail Foundation.[13]\\r\\nThe trail is 10.1 miles (16.3?km) long and mostly flat, with 97.5% of it at less than an 8% grade. The trail's surface is smooth and is mostly crushed granite except for a few lengths of concrete and a boardwalk[14] on the South-side of the lake. A pedestrian bridge incorporated into the trail bridges Barton Creek. The Roberta Crenshaw Pedestrian Walkway spans Lady Bird Lake beneath MoPac Boulevard and provides the trail's westernmost crossing of Lady Bird Lake.\\r\\nLady Bird Lake has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. The predominant fish species in Lady Bird Lake are largemouth bass, catfish, carp, and sunfish. Fishing is regulated, requiring a fishing license, and daily bag and length limits apply for most species.\\r\\nA ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was issued by the City of Austin in 1990, as a result of excessively high levels of chlordane found in the fish.[15] Although the use of chlordane as a pesticide was banned in the United States in 1988, the chemical sticks strongly to soil particles and can continue to pollute groundwater for years after its application. The ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was finally lifted in 1999.[16] Meeting transcript\\r\\nThe first water treatment facility in the City of Austin, the Thomas C. Green Water Treatment Plant, was built in 1925 to treat water from the Colorado River. The plant occupied 6 acres (2.4?ha) just west of the principal downtown business district.

On making landfall, Haiyan devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.[1] It is the deadliest Philippine typhoon on record,[2] killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone.[3] In terms of JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds, Haiyan is tied with Meranti for being the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record. In January 2014, bodies were still being found.[4]\\r\\nThe thirtieth named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia on November 2, 2013. Tracking generally westward, environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis and the system developed into a tropical depression the following day. After becoming a tropical storm and attaining the name Haiyan at 0000 UTC on November 4, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity by 1800 UTC on November 5. By November 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; the storm passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after attaining this strength.\\r\\nThereafter, it continued to intensify; at 1200 UTC on November 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the storm's maximum ten-minute sustained winds to 230?km/h (145?mph), the highest in relation to the cyclone. The Hong Kong Observatory put the storm's maximum ten-minute sustained winds at 285?km/h (180?mph)[5] prior to landfall in the central Philippines, while the China Meteorological Administration estimated the maximum two-minute sustained winds at the time to be around 78?m/s (280?km/h or 175?mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated the system's one-minute sustained winds to 315?km/h (195?mph), unofficially making Haiyan the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed based on wind speed, a record which would then be surpassed by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 at 345?km/h (215?mph).[6] Haiyan is also tied with Typhoon Meranti in 2016 as the strongest tropical cyclone in the Eastern Hemisphere by 1-minute sustained winds; several others have recorded lower central pressure readings. At 20:04 UTC on November 7, the eye of the cyclone made its first landfall in the Philippines at Guiuan, Eastern Samar. Gradually weakening, the storm made five additional landfalls in the country before emerging over the South China Sea. Turning northwestward, the typhoon eventually struck northern Vietnam as a severe tropical storm on November 10. Haiyan was last noted as a tropical depression by the JMA the following day.\\r\\nThe cyclone caused catastrophic destruction in the Visayas, particularly on Samar and Leyte. According to UN officials, about 11 million people have been affected ÿ many have been left homeless.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a broad low-pressure area about 425 kilometers (265 miles) east-southeast of Pohnpei, one of the states in the Federated States of Micronesia.[nb 1] As the system moved through a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis,[9] the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression early on November 3.[10][nb 2]\\r\\nThe system quickly intensified into a tropical storm, prompting the JMA to assign it the name Haiyan (Chinese: ; literally: \\"petrel\\") at 0000 UTC on November 4.[10] Tracking generally westward along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge,[12] rapid intensification ensued by November 5 as a central dense overcast with an embedded eye developing; the JMA classified Haiyan as a typhoon later that day.[10] On November 6, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigned the storm the local name Yolanda as it approached their area of responsibility.[13]\\r\\nIntensification slowed somewhat during the day, though the JTWC estimated the storm to have attained Category 5-equivalent super typhoon status on the SaffirÿSimpson hurricane wind scale around 1200 UTC.[nb 3][15] Later, the eye of the typhoon passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau.[16]\\r\\nAround 1200 UTC on November 7, Haiyan attained ten-minute sustained winds of 230?km/h (145?mph) and a minimum central pressure of 895 mbar (hPa; 26.43 inHg).[10] Six hours later, the JTWC estimated Haiyan to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 315?km/h (195?mph) and gusts up to 380?km/h (235?mph).[17] The storm displayed some characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone, though a strong convective band remained present along the western side of the system.[17]\\r\\nAt 2040 UTC on November 7, Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in Guiuan, Eastern Samar at peak intensity.[18] The JTWC's unofficial estimate of one-minute sustained winds of 305?km/h (190?mph) would, by that measure, make Haiyan the most powerful storm ever recorded to strike land.[19] Interaction with land caused slight degradation of the storm's structure, though it remained an exceptionally powerful storm when it struck Tolosa, Leyte around 2300 UTC.[20] The typhoon made four additional landfalls as it traversed the Visayas:[21] Daanbantayan, Bantayan Island, Concepcion, and Busuanga Island.\\r\\nHaiyan, with its core disrupted by interaction with the Philippines, emerged over the South China Sea late on November 8.[22] Environmental conditions ahead of the storm soon became less favorable, as cool stable air began wrapping into the western side of the circulation.[23] Continuing across the South China Sea, Haiyan turned more northwesterly late on November 9 and through November 10 as it moved around the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge previously steering it westward.[24] Rapid weakening ensued as Haiyan approached its final landfall in Vietnam,[25] ultimately striking the country near Haiphong around 2100 UTC as a severe tropical storm.[10] Once onshore, the storm quickly diminished and was last noted as it dissipated over Guangxi Province, China, on November 11.[10]\\r\\nUpon JTWC's declaration of Tropical Depression 31W on November 3, a tropical storm warning was issued for Chuuk Lagoon, Losap, and Poluwat in the Federated States of Micronesia. Further west, Faraulep, Satawal, and Woleai, were placed under a typhoon watch while Fananu and Ulul were placed under a tropical storm watch.[26] The following day, the tropical storm warning expanded to include Satawal while a typhoon warning was issued for Woleai.[27] Much of Yap State and the islands of Koror and Kayangel in Palau were placed under a typhoon watch.[28] The government issued a mandatory evacuation for Kayangel, and although most residents ignored the warning, they all survived the storm.[16] As Haiyan progressed westward, the easternmost advisories were gradually discontinued.[28] As Haiyan intensified into a typhoon on November 5, warnings were raised across Palau and Yap State.[29][30] Government offices in Melekeok were used as an evacuation building for Palau.[31] Despite mandatory evacuation orders, most residents on Kayangel remained on the island and rode out the typhoon.[32]\\r\\nShortly before Typhoon Haiyan entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on November 6, PAGASA raised Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) No.1, the lowest of four levels, for much of the Visayas and Mindanao.[33] As the storm continued to approach the country, warnings expanded into Luzon and increased in severity for eastern areas.[34] By the evening of November 7, PSWS No. 4, the highest level of warning which indicates winds in excess of 185?km/h (115?mph) are expected, was raised for Biliran Island, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Northern Cebu, Metro Cebu, Samar, and Southern Leyte.[35][36] Through November 8, the coverage of PSWS No. 4 continued to expand, with areas in southern Luzon being included.[37]\\r\\nOfficials placed police officers in the Bicol Region ahead of the storm.[38] In the provinces of Samar and Leyte, classes were canceled, and residents in flood- and landslide-prone areas were required to evacuate.[39] Some of the storm-threatened areas were affected by an earlier earthquake in Bohol.[40] Then-Philippine President Noynoy Aquino requested the military to deploy planes and helicopters to the region expected to be affected.[41] As Haiyan was moving very fast, PAGASA issued warnings at different levels to about 60 of the 80 provinces, including the capital Metro Manila.[42] On November 8, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated, providing widespread charitable satellite coverage to relief organizations.[43]\\r\\nThe State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters hoisted a level three emergency response in the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong and Guangxi. All fishing vessels were urged to return to ports by noon on November 9.[44] The Hong Kong Observatory issued the Strong Monsoon Signal at 19:10 HKT on November 9,[45] and it was still in place on November 13.[46]\\r\\nOn November 8, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung activated the highest state of preparedness in the country.[47] Approximately 600,000 people across southern and central provinces were evacuated while a further 200,000 were evacuated in northern provinces. Alerts were sent to 85,328 seagoing vessels, with a collective crew of 385,372 people, to sail to safer waters away from the storm. Requests were sent to China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines to aid any fishermen who needed immediate shelter from the typhoon.[48] Threatening Vietnam after two other typhoons, Wutip and Nari, there were concerns that the storm would cause significant damage to homes with makeshift repairs.[49] Roughly 460,000 military personnel and other authorities were mobilized to assist in evacuation efforts.[48] Hundreds of flights were canceled across the country while schools were closed on November 11. On the small island of C?n C?, all residents were moved to underground shelters with enough supplies for several days.[50] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) branches in Vietnam prepared relief stockpiles, consisting of food, water, housing material, and ?6.6 billion (US$310,000) in funds.[48] The local United Nations Resident Coordinator, Pratibha Mehta, praised the government's actions and credited them with saving numerous lives.[47] However, there were complaints from many residents that the warnings came too late.[50]\\r\\nOn Kayangel in Palau, a high storm surge damaged several houses,[31] while strong winds downed trees.[16] Despite residents' refusal to evacuate, no fatalities or major injuries took place on the island. Helicopters were flown to the island to survey damage and provide relief supplies. The government planned to evacuate those who were left homeless from the island.[32] Koror, Babeldaob and Kayangel each lost access to water and power.[16] In Koror, winds reaching as high as 120?km/h (75?mph) blew out rooftops and downed trees and power lines. A causeway linking an offshore hospital to the main island was temporarily shut down after being inundated by water.[51] On the northern end of Babeldaob, Haiyan damaged schools and buildings.[31] Lying closest to Haiyan at the time of the typhoon's passage, Kayangel was flooded in its entirety, and all homes were destroyed. Though no people were killed there, 69 others were displaced by the storm.[51]\\r\\nSOURCE: Data gathered from the last update by National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) as of April 17, 2014.[3]\\r\\nTyphoon Haiyan, called Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, caused catastrophic damage throughout much of the islands of Leyte, where cities and towns were largely destroyed.[53] As of April 17, 2016, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) confirmed 6,300 fatalities across the country, 5,877 of those taking place in the Eastern Visayas.[3] The true death toll remains unclear, being claimed to be at least 10,000 by some victims from Tacloban City, Leyte. As of November 13, 2015, the Philippine Red Cross estimated that 22,000 people were missing.\\r\\nIn Surigao City, 281.9?mm (11.10?in) of rainfall was recorded, much of which fell in under 12 hours.[54] Storm surges were also recorded in many places. In the island of Leyte and Samar, PAGASA measured 5ÿ6 meter (15ÿ19?ft) waves.[55] In Tacloban, Leyte, the terminal building of Tacloban Airport was destroyed by a 5.2?m (17?ft) storm surge up to the height of the second story.[56] Along the airport, a storm surge of 4?m (13?ft) was estimated.[57] Waves of 4.6?m (15?ft) were also estimated.[58] On the western coast of Samar, the storm surge was not as significant.[59]\\r\\nHaiyan's first landfall was at Guiuan in Eastern Samar, where the typhoon touched down at 4:40am.[60][61] Nearly all structures in the township suffered at least partial damage, many of which were completely flattened.[62] For several days following Haiyan's first landfall, the damage situation in the fishing town remained unclear due to lack of communication in and out of the area.[63] The damage could finally be assessed after Philippine Air Force staff arrived in Guiuan on November 10.[64] Prior to this, a local priest was able to take his motorbike from Guiuan to the towns of Cabalogan and Calbayog (also in Samar) armed with photos of the devastation, shot on his mobile phone.[65]\\r\\nThere was widespread devastation from the storm surge in Tacloban City especially in San Jose, with many buildings being destroyed, trees knocked over or broken, and cars piled up.[58] The low-lying areas on the eastern side of Tacloban city were hardest hit, with some areas completely washed away. Flooding also extended for 1?km (0.62?mi) inland on the east coast of the province.[58] City administrator Tecson John Lim stated that roughly 90 percent of the city had been destroyed.[53] Journalists on the ground have described the devastation as, \\"off the scale, and apocalyptic\\".[66] Most families in Samar and Leyte lost some family members or relatives; families came in from outlying provinces looking for relatives, especially children, who may have been washed away.[67] The entire first floor of the Tacloban City Convention Center, which was serving as an evacuation shelter, was submerged by storm surge. Many residents in the building were caught off-guard by the fast rising waters and subsequently drowned or were injured in the building.[68]\\r\\nAlthough wind speeds were extreme, the major cause of damage and loss of life appears to have been storm surge. The major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of Samar and Leyte, with a particular focus on Tacloban, because of its location between Samar and Leyte, and the large population in low-lying areas.[59] Philippine Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas said the scale of the relief operation that was now required was overwhelming, with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris.[69]\\r\\nSebastian Rhodes Stampa, head of a UN disaster assessment co-ordination team, said there was \\"destruction on a massive scale\\" in Tacloban. \\"There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris. The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the [2004] Indian Ocean tsunami.\\"[58] There is little communication in the city, and no mobile phone coverage. Up the east coast of the Leyte there are numerous towns and villages that are completely cut off without any assistance. Large parts of Leyte and Samar are without power and may have no power for a month.[66]\\r\\nThe storm crossed the Visayas region for almost a day, causing widespread flooding. In Cebu and Bohol, struck by a magnitude 7.2 earthquake two weeks before, cities were also severely devastated.[70] During the morning of November 8, media stations across the country were able to broadcast live the destruction of Haiyan. However, before afternoon, all communications on the Visayas region failed. The Presidential Communications Department of President Benigno Aquino III had difficulty contacting DILG Secretary Mar Roxas and Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin in Tacloban City to plan relief.[71] Widespread power interruptions, landslides and flash floods were also reported. Major roads were blocked by trees, and impassable. 453 domestic and international airline flights were canceled. Some airports were also closed on November 8 and 9. Ferries were affected. Relief and rescue efforts were underway by November 9, but some places remained isolated and out of communication due to severe damage.[72]\\r\\nHaiyan tossed up large car sized boulders onto Calicoan Island in Eastern Samar, some carried uphill 10 meters. The largest weights 180-ton, and is considered the biggest ever moved during a tropical cyclone, since record keeping begun.[73] The NDRRMC finally confirmed a total of 6300 deaths in the Philippines and total damages were estimated at PHP?181.325 billion or 7009364472779443035?US$3.64?billion.[74]\\r\\nTyphoon Haiyan reached Hainan Province, where severe damage took place and six people were killed in various incidents.[75] The hardest hit area was Qionghai, where roughly 3,500 people across 20 villages were isolated due to extensive flooding.[76] Direct economic losses in Hainan amounted to 4.9 billion (US$803 million).[75] In Guangxi Province to the north, heavy rains up to 380?mm (15?in) fell and wind gusts reached 100?km/h (60?mph).[77] An estimated 1.21 million people were affected, of whom 26,300 were evacuated. Two people died while four others went missing after a car fell off a flooded road into a river near Beihai.[78] Losses throughout Guangxi amounted to 275 million (US$45 million).[75][77] Approximately 900 homes and 25,500 hectares of crops were destroyed, while 8,500 homes were damaged. Additionally, an estimated 3 million people were affected by the storm throughout Southern China.[79] A cargo ship broke moorings at Sanya on November 8;[80] three members of the crew drowned while four others went missing.[77] One person also went missing off the coast of Lantau Island, Hong Kong.[81]\\r\\nAlong the coast of New Taipei, 16 people were swept out to sea by three 8?m (26?ft) waves. After several hours of search and rescue, eight were hospitalized while the other eight drowned. This was considered the largest loss of life from waves in Taiwan in several years.[82] Total economic losses in Taiwan were amounted to be NTS 1.7 billion(USD 57.46 million).[83]\\r\\nHaiyan made landfall as a severe tropical storm in Qu?ng Ninh Province on November 10 and produced high winds and widespread heavy rainfall which affected northern Vietnam.[84] Rainfall totals of up to 461?mm (18.1?in) and wind gusts of up to 147?km/h (91?mph) were recorded.[84] Ten people were killed while they were preparing for Haiyan's landfall, while no one was killed after the system made landfall; however, 4 people are missing in Qu?ng Ninh Province.[84]The death figure is subsequently updated to 14 in addition to 4 missing with 81 people being injured. [85] Most of the deaths are indirectly related to Haiyan.[86]\\r\\nDue to extensive damage and high death toll, PAGASA announced that the name Yolanda would be stricken off the typhoon naming lists.[87][88] PAGASA chose the name Yasmin to replace Yolanda for the 2017 season. During their 2014 annual session the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee announced that the name Haiyan would also be retired from its naming lists on January 1, 2015, and was therefore replaced by the name Bailu.[89]\\r\\nBy November 11, the provinces of Aklan, Capiz, Cebu, Iloilo, Leyte, Palawan, and Samar, were placed under a state of national calamity, allowing the government to use state funds for relief and rehabilitation and to control prices of basic goods.[90] Additionally, approximately ?30.6 million (US$700,000) had been allocated in relief assistance by the NDRRMC. Local and national agencies deployed a collective 18,177 personnel, 844 vehicles, 44 seagoing vessels, and 31 aircraft for various operations.[3] CBCP also declared 8 days of mourning for victims of the typhoon on the same date.[91]\\r\\nWorld Health Organization Representative in the Philippines Dr Julie Hall noted that while many survivors requiring medical attention in the first week suffer from trauma and fractures, the concern shifts toward chronic conditions as the weeks pass. The WHO coordinated the massive international response to help the Philippine government meet the acute need for healthcare services in the affected areas.[92]\\r\\nExtreme damage to infrastructure throughout the region posed logistical problems that greatly slowed relief efforts. Though aid was flown into local airports, most of it remained there as roads remained closed.[93] According to estimates on November 13, only 20 percent of the affected population in Tacloban City was receiving aid. With lack of access to clean water, some residents dug up water pipes and boiled water from there in order to survive. Thousands of people sought to evacuate the city via C-130 cargo planes, however, the slow process fueled further aggravation. Reports of escaped prisoners raping women in the city prompted a further urgency to evacuate. One resident was quoted as saying \\"Tacloban is a dead city.\\"[53] Due to the lack of electricity, planes could only operate during the daylight, further slowing the evacuations. At dawn on November 12, thousands of people broke through fences and rushed planes only to be forced back by police and military personnel. A similar incident occurred later that day as a U.S. cargo plane was landing.[94]\\r\\nOn November 14, a correspondent from the BBC reported Tacloban to be a \\"war zone,\\" although the situation soon stabilized when the presence of government law enforcement was increased. Safety concerns prompted several relief agencies to back out of the operation, and some United Nations staff were pulled out for safety reasons. A message circulating among the agencies urged them to not go into Tacloban for this reason.[95] On the west coast of Leyte Island, residents in Ormoc were fearing that the focus on Tacloban City would leave them without aid. Though not as hard hit, roughly 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed and supplies were running low. Hospitals in the city were either shut down or working at partial capacity, leaving many of the nearly 2,000 injured in the city without medical assistance. In nearby Baybay, lack of assistance fueled anger and incited looting for survival.[96]\\r\\nIn the coastal community Guiuan, which took the full brunt of the typhoon, Mayor Christopher Gonzalez is credited with saving countless lives after he incessantly urged residents to evacuate. He referred to the storm as \\"delubyo (deluge),\\" which roughly translates to Armageddon. Of the town's 45,000 residents, 87 died, 931 were injured, and 23 others were listed as missing. U.S. Navy Capt. Russell Hays, a medical officer, estimated that a storm of Haiyan's caliber could have killed as many as 4,500 in Guiuan alone had it not been for the mayor's efforts.[97]\\r\\nOn November 18, the government of the Philippines launched an online portal, called the Foreign Aid Transparency Hub (FaiTH), that provides the public a transparency view of the funds and other aids received by the government from the international community.[98][99]\\r\\nTo lead the management and rehabilitation efforts of the central provinces in the Philippines affected by Typhoon Haiyan, Philippines President Benigno Aquino III appointed Panfilo Lacson as Typhoon Haiyan Rehabilation Czar.[100]\\r\\nTyphoon Haiyan knocked over Power Barge 103 of NAPOCOR in Estancia, Iloilo causing an oil spill.[101][102][103][104] As a result of the typhoon, the government is planning to replant mangroves in coastal areas while preserving the remaining ones.[105] Affected residents were allowed to return to their homes by the Department of Health on December 7, 2013 after an air quality test found out that benzene levels in affected areas reached near-zero parts per million. Earlier, residents were asked to evacuate affected areas as the benzene levels had reached unhealthy amounts.[106]\\r\\nThroughout Tacloban City, widespread looting took place in the days following Haiyan's passage. In some instances, relief trucks were attacked and had food stolen in the city. Two of the city's malls and numerous grocery stores were subjected to looting. A fuel depot in the city was guarded by armed police while 200 additional officers were dispatched to assist.[107] Security checkpoints had since been set up all over Tacloban and a curfew was imposed on residents to prevent more attacks.[108] Philippine military forces also prevented members of the New People's Army from ambushing a relief convoy bound for Samar in Matnog, Sorsogon, killing two.[109] President Benigno Aquino III considered declaring martial law in hopes of restoring order in affected areas.[110][111]\\r\\nLooting intensified as slow recovery efforts forced residents to seek any means necessary to survive. Tacloban city administrator Tecson John Lim stated, \\"The looting is not criminality. It is self-preservation.\\" The Chicago Tribune reported that some areas were on the brink of anarchy, though Interior Secretary Mar Roxas denied such claims.[53] Further complicating efforts to retain order was the lack of officers reporting for work. In Tacloban, only 100 of the city's 1,300 police personnel reported for duty.[94] In Alangalang, just west of Tacloban, eight people were crushed to death after the walls of a warehouse collapsed during a raid on a government rice stockpile. Approximately 33,000 bags of rice, each weighing 50?kg (110?lb), were stolen. Warehouses were also raided in Jaro and Palo. Throughout the city of Tacloban itself, people began looting from homes as stores had been completely emptied.[53]\\r\\nCondemnations of slow government action in the relief effort in response to the typhoon mounted days after the storm had passed. Media reports criticized the Aquino administration for apparent lack of preparation and coordination among government agencies in the aid operation.[112][113] Up until November 12, five days after the typhoon struck, survivors continued to struggle with basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter while remote towns in Leyte and Samar were yet to be reached by aid.[114] The Philippine government responded by saying that they have dealt with the tragedy \\"quite well\\" but the response had been slow due to the breakdown of the local governance in affected areas where officials and employees, who were usually the first to respond in these events, were victims of the typhoon themselves.[115] Cabinet Secretary Jose Rene Almendras said that the national government had to take over despite logistical challenges and assured it is working toward providing aid the quickest way possible to the survivors.[116] The national Government was also criticized for putting the responsibility of handling the dead to the Bureau of Fire instead to the Department of Health. Dr. Racquel Fortun, one of the forensic experts to go to the area three days after the typhoon insisted that handling of the bodies is a health matter and therefore a responsibility of DOH.[117]\\r\\nOne of the biggest controversies of Typhoon Haiyan is probably the number of the victims or the body count. According to the Philippine government sources, the number of those killed during the typhoon ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 individuals while some sources claim that the body count reaches up to 15,000.[118][119][120]\\r\\nThe Philippines faced a humanitarian crisis days after the typhoon hit much of the Visayas with 1.9 million homeless and more than 6,000,000 displaced.[121] In Tacloban alone, ninety percent of the structures are either destroyed or damaged while other cities, such as Ormoc, are reporting similar damage.[122] The United Nations fear that the possibility of the spread of disease is high due to the lack of food, water, shelter, and medication. Casualties have been reported as a result of the lack of aid in affected areas and the number of dead is likely to rise.[123]\\r\\nAs a result of the damage in Tacloban and much of Leyte, thousands of people who once lived in the area left and made their way into less affected areas such as Cebu and Manila.[124] Catbalogan reported that their population more than doubled after the typhoon with the influx of refugees into the city.[125] Around 20,000 people have fled to Manila as a result of the storm.[126]\\r\\n[193][194][195] [196]\\r\\nAircraft from the Republic of China Air Force and Republic of China Navy vessel deployed with supplies.\\r\\nThe United Nations said it was going to increase critical relief operations as a result of the devastation caused by the typhoon. Its Manila office issued a statement that read, \\"Access remains a key challenge as some areas are still cut off from relief operations. Unknown numbers of survivors do not have basic necessities such as food, water and medicines and remain inaccessible for relief operations, as roads, airports and bridges were destroyed or covered in wreckage.\\"[217] The United Nations also began relief operations by this time; however, the severe damage to infrastructure hampered efforts to distribute supplies.[107] The UN activated the Cluster System, in which groups of humanitarian organizations (UN and non-UN) work to restore health, shelter, nutrition and economic activity.[218]\\r\\nThe World Health Organization, which leads the Health Cluster, the largest one, has developed guidance on donations of medicine and healthcare equipment, so that the Philippines receives supplies appropriate for this emergency. According to WHO, many people suffered cuts, wounds, and broken bones during the disaster and others were injured in flooding that followed the typhoon.[219] Interpol announced that they would send in Interpol officers from Lyon to help local law enforcement identify any of the corpses that are unidentified.[220]\\r\\nThe World Health Organization has spearheaded initiatives among help workers, especially from the Department of Health (Philippines), in extending Psychological First Aid to people in typhoon-affected areas. WHO Representative in the country Dr Julie Hall foresees long-lasting effects from the typhoon. She calls for increased preparedness to give support to families and communities for the long-term, citing the need for more trained field workers.[221]\\r\\nAmerican band Journey donated $350,000 to help relief efforts in the Philippines, and its lead singer had a message for his homeland: \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\". Arnel Pineda (the band's Filipino vocalist) and the rest of the band announced the donation on November 15, 2013. It will go to the United Nations World Food Programme, which is providing Filipinos with food assistance. The donation should provide 1.4 million meals.[222] IKEA, Walmart, Samsung, and HSBC are among those taking advantage of the event to donate to those in need.[223][224] Northwestern Mutual announced they will donate $100,000 to the American Red Cross.[225] The Coca-Cola Company says they have donated $2.5 million of their advertising budget to the relief efforts as of November 25.[226] By mid-December FIFA donated $1 million.[227] DHL deployed its Asia Pacific Disaster Response Team to the disaster areas to provide on-the-ground logistics support to assist with the relief effort in the aftermath of the devastating Typhoon Haiyan. Three rotating teams made up of volunteer employees from the Asia Pacific region were based at the Mactan Cebu Airport on Cebu island, providing support and assistance to the country's most affected areas west of Leyte Island, including Guiuan, Roxas, and Tacloban city.[228] Many smaller initiatives were founded as well - e.g. to prepare by donating to children a typhoon-ready backpack as floating device.[229]\\r\\nSixteen-time NBA Champions Los Angeles Lakers donated $150,000 [230] to the Philippine Red Cross to aid the typhoon affected victims. During their home game against the Memphis Grizzlies, Kobe Bryant handed the check to the Junior NBA players representing the Philippines. His teammate, Pau Gasol, pledged to donate $1,000 per point to UNICEF[231] with the directive to help victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan in the country as well. He scored 24 points in a won game against the Golden State Warriors. Major League Baseball donated $200,000 to UNICEF and the American Red Cross, with Commissioner Bud Selig encouraging fans to donate to the organizations.[232] UNICEF delivered portable toilets and hygiene supplies to the region and also appealed for $34 million to help the four million children affected.[233] The American Red Cross announced that they collected $11 million in donations for the Philippines Relief Fund.[234] Mercy Corps dispatched a \\"emergency response\\" team to help with humanitarian efforts.[235] MAP International launched medical relief efforts providing over $10 million in medicines and supplies to the Philippines.\\r\\nAmong the NGO responses, among the most comprehensive disaster response came from the Taiwan-based \\"Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation\\".?, which organized a large-scale cash-for-work program in Tacloban from Nov 20 to Dec 8 with up to 31,000 participants per day, totaling nearly 300,000 day shifts. This operation not only helped clean out the thousands of tons of debris covering the city, but also kick-started the local economy. Tzu Chi also contributed emergency cash aid of 8000, 12000 or 15000 pesos depending on family size for over 60,000 families in the affected areas of Tacloban, Ormoc, Palo, Tanauan and Tunga, and has been providing free clinics, hot meals, and temporary class rooms for over 15 schools in the area. Doctors Without Borders is sending 200 tons of aid.[215][236] The International Society for Krishna Consciousness's Food For Life Global, the world's largest vegan food relief organisation, raised money and provided vegan meals in the Philippines to Typhoon Haiyan survivors.[237][238] Other NGOs run by faith-based organisations that raised money and/or aided in the disaster relief efforts of Typhoon Haiyan included Catholic Relief Services,[239] Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB),[239] Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA),[239] LDS Philanthropies,[240] American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (AJJDC),[239] Samaritan's Purse,[239] Salvation Army,[239] Christian Children's Fund of Canada,[239] MAP International and World Vision.[239]\\r\\nThe Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC), the largest indigenous Christian church based in the Philippines held series of massive relief distributions and medical and dental missions to affected population of the storm to different parts of Visayas.[241] The humanitarian mission was done under the \\"Lingap sa Mamamayan\\" (Aid for Humanity) project in cooperation with the Felix Y. Manalo (FYM) Foundation Inc., the INCs charitable arm.[242][243] The church conducted the largest walk for a cause in the world (walkathon) on February 15, 2014, dubbed as 'Iglesia Ni Cristo World Wide Walk for Those Affected by Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan'.[244][245] The walk for a cause raised millions of money to help the victims of the super typhoon for the construction of their houses and shelters. The aim of the activity is to make the world understand that Haiyan survivors are still in dare need of help and financial assistance. Indeed, the worldwide walk caught the attention of the world when it breaks two Guinness world records as the largest charity walk in a single venue (Manila, Philippines) with 175,000 participants, and largest charity walk in 24 hours for multiple venues (from Christchurch, New Zealand to Hawaii, USA) in 13 time zones, 54 countries, 24 hours with 519, 521 participants.[246][247]\\r\\nCelebrities such as David and Victoria Beckham,[248] Stephen Colbert,[249] Kim Kardashian,[250] David Guetta,[251] and The X Factor contributed to the fundraising.[252] On November 26, iTunes released a compilation album entitled Songs for the Philippines featuring different artists, including Katy Perry, Madonna, Bob Dylan, and The Beatles.[253] All proceeds will go to the Philippine Red Cross.[253] OneRepublic donated $100,000 on November 30, 2013.[254] Other celebrities that offered their support included Linkin Park, The Offspring,[255] Alicia Keys,[256] and Justin Bieber.[257]\\r\\nOn the day of his death, actor Paul Walker attended a charity event for his organization, Reach Out Worldwide, for the victims of the typhoon that was held right before his accident.[258]\\r\\nOn March 11, 2014, a benefit concert called The Pinoy Relief Benefit Concert was held at Madison Square Garden in New York, City. Jennifer Hudson, Pentatonix, A Great Big World, Plain White T's, Jessica Sanchez, Charice and REO Brothers performed. Special guests also included Dr. Oz, Dante Basco, Bobby Lopez, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Apl.de.ap. 100% of proceeds raised directly went to the Typhoon Haiyan survivors.[259] Pinoy Relief was created to help survivors and focus on three specific areas: restoring livelihoods, building classrooms and providing shelter in partnership with local NGOs, Habitat for Humanity Philippines and Operation Blessing Philippines.[260]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2016, former United States of America vice president Al Gore, visited Tacloban and delivered his speech in front of the survivors of Haiyan. He also dropped by at the MV Eva Jocelyn, a cargo ship that washed out inland during the typhoon and now converted into a memorial park.[261]\\r\\nThe aid contributions of China and the United States were given focus with regards to their involvement in the politics of the Philippines.[262] Apart from having the two largest economies in the world, both countries are involved in a complex relationship with the island country. China is currently disputing the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea with the Philippines while the United States used to be an occupying power and currently has a mutual defense treaty with the islands.[263] American news media initially criticized China for its contribution of US $100,000 cash each from the government and the Chinese Red Cross to the typhoon victims, which led to commentary about its disputes with the Philippines.[264] Earlier in 2013, the Philippines sued China over the nine-dotted line. Western commentators attribute this low amount to China's intentions to isolate the Philippines while strengthening its ties with the rest of Southeast Asia.[265] The move had mixed reactions from the public of China with some commending its decision while others, such as The Global Times, insisted that China should be a responsible power. China later increased its contributions by US$1.64 million in supplies [141][266] and sent its naval hospital ship Peace Ark for disaster relief.\\"[142]\\r\\nThe United States gave the Philippines an amount of US$51.9 million worth of aid and deployed the United States Marines, United States Navy and United States Air Force in order to assist with the humanitarian operations.[267] The Philippine government had been discussing with the U.S. plans regarding the deployment of U.S. military troops within the country. [268] This was part of the \\"Asia pivot\\" that the United States government had previously announced, a foreign policy strategy widely viewed as a plan to contain China, encircle it militarily, and prevent it from competing with American political influence in the region; the calculated giving of humanitarian aid is a tool which United States uses to achieve its geopolitical aims. [269]\\r\\nFollowing Typhoon Haiyan's landfall in Vietnam, widespread search and rescue missions took place in the affected provinces. Damage assessments were also conducted in 13 provinces to determine what aid was needed. The IFRC began distribution of relief supplies and assisted residents in returning home by November 12. Operations regarding the aftermath of Typhoon Wutip were temporarily suspended due to Haiyan.[48]\\r\\nPolitical leaders and climate scientists connected the typhoon to climate change, both at the time and subsequently[270] and led to calls for climate justice.[271] The 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference was coincidentally in progress when the typhoon struck and Yeb Sa?o, the lead negotiator of the Philippines delegation, received a standing ovation at the conference when he declared a hunger strike.\\r\\nIn solidarity with my countrymen who are struggling to find food back home, I will now commence a voluntary fasting for the climate; this means I will voluntarily refrain from eating food during this COP, until a meaningful outcome is in sight.\\r\\nSeveral delegates, including American delegate Collin Reese, joined him in fasting. Sixty people from Climate Action Network, an umbrella group of environmental non-governmental organisations, also joined the hunger strike.[273]\\r\\nThe correlation between the increasing intensity of storms and the progression of climate change was discussed by climate scientists. \\"Typhoons, hurricanes and all tropical storms draw their vast energy from the warmth of the sea.

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Assassination of Versace starts with a bang and unfurls slowly, moving backward through an intricate (and occasionally convoluted) murder mystery anchored by a career-defining performance from Darren Criss.\\"[57] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn January 2018, the Versace family released a statement criticizing the series. They explained they have \\"neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever\\" in the production of the season, before adding that it \\"should only be considered as a work of fiction.\\"[59] Executive producer Ryan Murphy answered that the series was \\"not a work of fiction\\" as it is based on a non-fiction book, Maureen Orth's Vulgar Favors, and that the production team and FX stand by the author and her work. Comparing it to The People v. O. J. Simpson, Murphy added that the season is \\"a work of non-fiction obviously with docudrama elements,\\" and not a documentary.[59] Following this answer, the Versace family released a second statement, still slamming the series as \\"a work of fiction\\" because \\"the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation.\\" They also heavily criticized Orth's work, calling it an \\"effort to create a sensational story\\" with \\"second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.\\" They gave the example of Gianni Versace's medical condition, as Orth claims that Versace was HIV positive at the time of his death.[60]\\r\\nAntonio D'Amico also criticized the series, deeming some scenes as \\"ridiculous\\" and insisting that \\"so much has been fictionalised\\". He also revealed that he does not plan to watch it, but that he would have been happy if Ricky Martin, who plays his role, got in contact to get some insight into his relationship with Versace.[61]\\r\\nAccording to Ryan Murphy, Donatella Versace was very supportive that Penlope Cruz played her role. As Cruz and Versace are friends, Murphy explained that, when he offered her the role, Cruz asked the permission of Versace before agreeing to do it. He also revealed that, while Cruz was representing the series at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Versace \\"very graciously sent [her] a lovely and huge flower arrangement saying 'good luck.'\\"[59]","input":"Where did they film the assasination of gianni versace?"},{"output":"June 14, 1777","context":"The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag, is the national flag of the United States. It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the \\"union\\") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S.[1] Nicknames for the flag include The Stars and Stripes,[2] Old Glory,[3] and The Star-Spangled Banner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current design of the U.S. flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over 57 years.[4]\\r\\nThe Continental Colors\\r\\n(aka the \\"Grand Union Flag\\")\\r\\nFlag of the British East India Company, 1707ÿ1801\\r\\nAt the time of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with \\"stars, white in a blue field\\" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as \\"the Continental Colors\\" has historically been referred to as the first national flag.[5]\\r\\nThe Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independencelikely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripesand would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs.[5][6]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grand Union\\" was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the U.S. flag.[6]\\r\\nThe flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the company flag inspired the design.[7] Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, one of the three maritime flags used throughout the British Empire at the time. However, an East India Company flag could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.[8]\\r\\nIn any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.\\r\\nOn June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\"[9] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year. While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment.[10]\\r\\nThe first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by Congress for his coat for the flag.[11]\\r\\nThe 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign. In the late 18th century, the notion of a national flag did not yet exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern \\"it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States.\\"[12] However, the term, \\"Standard,\\" referred to a national standard for the Army of the United States. Each regiment was to carry the national standard in addition to its regimental standard. The national standard was not a reference to the national or naval flag.[13]\\r\\nThe Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa.[14] The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial.[15] One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.[16]\\r\\nDespite the 1777 resolution, the early years of American independence featured many different flags. Most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. While there are many examples of 13-star arrangements, some of those flags included blue stripes as well as red and white. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, in a letter dated October 3, 1778, to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, described the American flag as consisting of \\"13 stripes, alternately red, white, and blue, a small square in the upper angle, next the flag staff, is a blue field, with 13 white stars, denoting a new Constellation.\\"[17] John Paul Jones used a variety of 13-star flags on his U.S. Navy ships including the well-documented 1779 flags of the Serapis and the Alliance. The Serapis flag had three rows of eight-pointed stars with stripes that were red, white, and blue. The flag for the Alliance, however, had five rows of eight-pointed stars with 13 red and white stripes, and the white stripes were on the outer edges.[18] Both flags were documented by the Dutch government in October 1779, making them two of the earliest known flags of 13 stars.[19]\\r\\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag[20] while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.[21] Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.[22] In this letter, he asked for a \\"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \\"great Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the first bill; the \\"Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the second bill; and \\"the Naval Flag of the States\\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones ÿ in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.[23] Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;[24] whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones.[25] Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal.[23] When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.[26] The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.[27][28] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.[29][30] Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle.[31]\\r\\nThe origin of the stars and stripes design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the descendants of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870.[32] By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776.[33] Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.[34]\\r\\nThe family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag.[35] Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.[36][37] According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.[38]\\r\\nIn 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", later known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", which is now the American national anthem. The flag is currently on display in the exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem\\" at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.[39]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid[40] in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.[41]\\r\\nPrior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century there was an abundance of different star patterns, rectangular and circular.\\r\\nOn July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in longest use, surpassing the 48-star flag that was used from 1912 to 1959.\\r\\nThe U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (GuҊngzhu) in China in 1784 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of ginseng.[42] There it gained the designation \\"Flower Flag\\" (Chinese: ; pinyin: huq; Cantonese Yale: fke).[43] According to a pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later retold by author and U.S. naval officer George H. Preble:\\r\\nWhen the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing a flag \\"as beautiful as a flower.\\" Every body went to see the kwa kee chuen [; Fkesyhn], or \\"flower flagship.\\" This name at once established itself in the language, and America is now called the kwa kee kwoh [??; Fkegwok], the \\"flower flag country\\"and an American, kwa kee kwoh yin [??; Fkegwokyhn]\\"flower flag countryman\\"a more complimentary designation than that of \\"red headed barbarian\\"the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.[44][45]\\r\\nIn the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[46] Other Asian nations have equivalent terms for America, for example Vietnamese: Hoa K? (\\"Flower Flag\\"). Chinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: ˇ; traditional Chinese: ˇ??; pinyin: Migu܇. Mi is short for Miljin (simplified Chinese: ˇͫ; traditional Chinese: ˇͫ??, phono-semantic matching of \\"American\\") and \\"gu܇\\" means \\"country\\", so this name is unrelated to the flag. However, the \\"flower flag\\" terminology persists in some places today: for example, American Ginseng is called simplified Chinese: y; traditional Chinese: ??; literally: \\"flower flag ginseng\\" in Chinese, and Citibank, which opened a branch in China in 1902, is known as 跐k; \\"Flower Flag Bank\\".[46]\\r\\nThe U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787ÿ90 on board the Columbia.[43] William Driver, who coined the phrase \\"Old Glory\\", took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831ÿ32.[43] The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world journey in 1871.[47]\\r\\nIn the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag were not standardized until 1934.[48]\\r\\nIn the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico voted to become a U.S. state. However, the legitimacy of the result of this election was disputed.[50] On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but it had a turnout of only 23%.[51][52] Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.[53]\\r\\nThe modern meaning of the flag was forged in December 1860, when Major Robert Anderson moved the U.S. garrison from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Author Adam Goodheart argues this was the opening move of the American Civil War, and the flag was used throughout northern states to symbolize U.S. nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\\r\\nBefore that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flewas it does today, and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.\\r\\nÿ Adam Goodheart.[54]\\r\\nThe flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage, but remains protected as freedom of speech. Scholars have noted the irony that \\"[t]he flag is so revered because it represents the land of the free, and that freedom includes the ability to use or abuse that flag in protest\\".[55] In worldwide comparison, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also \\"beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects\\".[56]\\r\\nThe man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag was Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his grandparents in Ohio.[57] He received a B? on the project.[58] According to Heft, his history teacher honored their agreement to change his grade to an A after his design was selected.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C.??1; 4 U.S.C.??2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states. The specification gives the following values:\\r\\nThese specifications are contained in an executive order which, strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal government.[62] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes are 2 G 3?ft. or 4 G 6?ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 G 4?ft. or 5 G 8?ft. (1.6), or 3 G 5?ft. or 6 G 10?ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators are provided in these sizes.[63] Flags that are made to the prescribed 1.9 ratio are often referred to as \\"G-spec\\" (for \\"government specification\\") flags.\\r\\nThe exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are \\"White\\", \\"Old Glory Red\\", and \\"Old Glory Blue\\".[64] The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946.[65] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing. The \\"relative\\" coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag's \\"white\\".\\r\\nAs with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \\"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\\"[67]\\r\\nSometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002.[68] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should be \\"(1) the same colors used in the United States flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the Pantone Matching System.\\"[69]\\r\\nWhen Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.[71] At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.\\r\\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a Bÿ for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.[72] According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project.[60] The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.[60]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \\"...?is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy?...\\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.[73] Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,[74][75] most recently and forcefully in Colorado v. Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals judgment that was released in May 2010.[76] Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all occasions.\\r\\nThe flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5 feet (0.91 by 1.52?m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying \\"this flag dips to no earthly king\\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.[77][78]\\r\\nThe flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)[79]\\r\\nThe Flag Code prohibits using the flag \\"for any advertising purpose\\" and also states that the flag \\"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\\".[80] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\\r\\nSection 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: \\"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\\", and \\"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\\". Section 3 of the Flag Code[81] defines \\"the flag\\" as anything \\"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\\".\\r\\nAn additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \\"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforcedindeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.[82] Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\\r\\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\\r\\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module, Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \\"streaming\\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\\r\\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.[83] Several US military uniforms, such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Air Force and Navy, have the flag patch on the left shoulder.[84][85]\\r\\nOther organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction. The congressional charter of the Boy Scouts of America stipulates that the uniforms should not imitate U.S. military uniforms; consequently, the flags are displayed on the right shoulder with the stripes facing front, the reverse of the military style.[86] Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch, either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.\\r\\nEvery U.S. astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case, the canton was on the left.\\r\\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.[87] Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\\r\\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.[39]\\r\\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\\r\\nThe flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:[103]\\r\\nThe flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\\r\\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.[107]\\r\\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\\r\\nNational Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. In 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.[104][113][104]\\r\\nThough not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use. To properly fold the flag:\\r\\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.[114][115]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals,[116] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.[117]\\r\\nFlag of Bikini Atoll\\r\\nFlag of Liberia\\r\\nFlag of Malaysia\\r\\nFlag of El Salvador 1875ÿ1912\\r\\nFlag of Brittany","input":"When did the american flag come into existence?"},{"output":"Kanpur","context":"Former parties\\r\\nFormer parties\\r\\nFormer parties\\r\\nThe Communist Party of India (CPI) (Bhratؐya Kamyunis? Pr?ؐ) is a communist party in India. There are different views on exactly when it was founded. The date maintained as the foundation day by the CPI is 26 December 1925 .[3] The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which separated from the CPI, believes it was founded in 1925.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Communist Party of India has officially stated that it was formed on 26 December 1920 at the first Party Conference in Kanpur. But as per the version of CPI(M), the Communist Party of India was founded in Tashkent, Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 17 October 1920, soon after the Second Congress of the Communist International. The founding members of the party were M.N. Roy, Evelyn Trent Roy (Roy's wife), Abani Mukherji, Rosa Fitingof (Abani's wife), Mohammad Ali (Ahmed Hasan), Mohammad Shafiq Siddiqui, Rafiq Ahmed of Bhopal and M.P.B.T. Aacharya, and Sultan Ahmed Khan Tarin of North-West Frontier Province.[4][5][6] The CPI says that there were many communist groups formed by Indians with the help of foreigners in different parts of the world and the Tashkent group was only one of. contacts with Anushilan and Jugantar groups in Bengal. Small communist groups were formed in Bengal (led by Muzaffar Ahmed), Bombay (led by S.A. Dange), Madras (led by Singaravelu Chettiar), United Provinces (led by Shaukat Usmani) and Punjab and Sindh (led by Ghulam Hussain). However, only Usmani became a CPI party member.[7]\\r\\nDuring the 1920s and the early 1930s the party was badly organised, and in practice there were several communist groups working with limited national coordination. The British colonial authorities had banned all communist activity, which made the task of building a united party very difficult. Between 1921 and 1924 there were three conspiracy trials against the communist movement; First Peshawar Conspiracy Case, Meerut Conspiracy Case and the kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case. In the first three cases, Russian-trained muhajir communists were put on trial. However, the Cawnpore trial had more political impact. On 17 March 1924, M.N. Roy, S.A. Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, Nalini Gupta, Shaukat Usmani, Singaravelu Chettiar, Ghulam Hussain and R.C. Sharma were charged, in Cawnpore (now spelt Kanpur) Bolshevik Conspiracy case. The specific pip charge was that they as communists were seeking \\"to deprive the King Emperor of his sovereignty of British India, by complete separation of India from imperialistic Britain by a violent revolution.\\" Pages of newspapers daily splashed sensational communist plans and people for the first time learned, on such a large scale, about communism and its doctrines and the aims of the Communist International in India.[8]\\r\\nSingaravelu Chettiar was released on account of illness. M.N. Roy was in Germany and R.C. Sharma in French Pondichry, and therefore could not be arrested. Ghulam Hussain confessed that he had received money from the Russians in Kabul and was pardoned. Muzaffar Ahmed, Nalini Gupta, Shaukat Usmani and Dange were sentenced for various terms of imprisonment. This case was responsible for actively introducing communism to a larger Indian audience.[8] Dange was released from prison in 1927. Rahul Dev Pal was a prominent communist leader\\r\\nOn 25 December 1925 a communist conference was organised in Kanpur.[9] Colonial authorities estimated that 500 persons took part in the conference. The conference was convened by a man called Satyabhakta. At the conference Satyabhakta argued for a 'National communism' and against subordination under Comintern. Being outvoted by the other delegates, Satyabhakta left the conference venue in protest. The conference adopted the name 'Communist Party of India'. Groups such as Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan (LKPH) dissolved into the unified CPI.[10] The migr CPI, which probably had little organic character anyway, was effectively substituted by the organisation now operating inside India.\\r\\nSoon after the 1926 conference of the Workers and Peasants Party of Bengal, the underground CPI directed its members to join the provincial Workers and Peasants Parties. All open communist activities were carried out through Workers and Peasants Parties.[11]\\r\\nThe sixth congress of the Communist International met in 1928. In 1927 the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The Colonial theses of the 6th Comintern congress called upon the Indian communists to combat the 'national-reformist leaders' and to 'unmask the national reformism of the Indian National Congress and oppose all phrases of the Swarajists, Gandhists, etc. about passive resistance'.[12] The congress did however differentiate between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Indian Swarajist Party, considering the latter as neither a reliable ally nor a direct enemy. The congress called on the Indian communists to utilize the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists.[13] The congress also denounced the WPP. The Tenth Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, 3 July 1929?ÿ 19 July 1929, directed the Indian communists to break with WPP. When the communists deserted it, the WPP fell apart.[14]\\r\\nOn 20 March 1929, arrests against WPP, CPI and other labour leaders were made in several parts of India, in what became known as the Meerut Conspiracy Case. The communist leadership was now put behind bars. The trial proceedings were to last for four years.[15][16]\\r\\nAs of 1934, the main centres of activity of CPI were Bombay, Calcutta and Punjab. The party had also begun extending its activities to Madras. A group of Andhra and Tamil students, amongst them P. Sundarayya, were recruited to the CPI by Amir Hyder Khan.[17]\\r\\nThe party was reorganised in 1933, after the communist leaders from the Meerut trials were released. A central committee of the party was set up. In 1934 the party was accepted as the Indian section of the Communist International.[18]\\r\\nWhen Indian leftwing elements formed the Congress Socialist Party in 1934, the CPI branded it as Social Fascist.[12]\\r\\nThe League Against Gandhism, initially known as the Gandhi Boycott Committee, was a political organisation in Calcutta, founded by the underground Communist Party of India and others to launch militant anti-Imperialist activities. The group took the name League Against Gandhism in 1934.[19]\\r\\nIn connection with the change of policy of the Comintern toward Popular Front politics, the Indian communists changed their relation to the Indian National Congress. The communists joined the Congress Socialist Party, which worked as the left wing of Congress. Through joining CSP, the CPI accepted the CSP demand for a Constituent Assembly, which it had denounced two years before. The CPI however analysed that the demand for a Constituent Assembly would not be a substitute for soviets.[20]\\r\\nIn July 1937, the first Kerala unit of CPI was founded at a clandestine meeting in Calicut. Five persons were present at the meeting, P. Krishna Pillai E.M.S. Namboodiripad, N.C. Sekhar, K. Damodaran and S.V. Ghate. The first four were members of the CSP in Kerala. The latter, Ghate, was a CPI Central Committee member, who had arrived from Madras.[21] Contacts between the CSP in Kerala and the CPI had begun in 1935, when P. Sundarayya (CC member of CPI, based in Madras at the time) met with EMS and Krishna Pillai. Sundarayya and Ghate visited Kerala at several times and met with the CSP leaders there. The contacts were facilitated through the national meetings of the Congress, CSP and All India Kisan Sabha.[17]\\r\\nIn 1936ÿ1937, the cooperation between socialists and communists reached its peak. At the 2nd congress of the CSP, held in Meerut in January 1936, a thesis was adopted which declared that there was a need to build 'a united Indian Socialist Party based on Marxism-Leninism'.[22] At the 3rd CSP congress, held in Faizpur, several communists were included into the CSP National Executive Committee.[23]\\r\\nIn Kerala communists won control over CSP, and for a brief period controlled Congress there.\\r\\nTwo communists, E.M.S. Namboodiripad and Z.A. Ahmed, became All India joint secretaries of CSP. The CPI also had two other members inside the CSP executive.[20]\\r\\nOn the occasion of the 1940 Ramgarh Congress Conference CPI released a declaration called Proletarian Path, which sought to utilise the weakened state of the British Empire in the time of war and gave a call for general strike, no-tax, no-rent policies and mobilising for an armed revolutionary uprising. The National Executive of the CSP assembled at Ramgarh took a decision that all communists were expelled from CSP.[24]\\r\\nIn July 1942, the CPI was legalised, as a result of Britain and the Sov iet Union becoming allies against Nazi Germany.[25] Communists strengthened their control over the All India Trade Union Congress. At the same time, communists were politically cornered for their opposition to the Quit India Movement.\\r\\nCPI contested the Provincial Legislative Assembly elections of 1946 of its own. It had candidates in 108 out of 1585 seats. It won in eight seats. In total the CPI vote counted 666 723, which should be seen with the backdrop that 86% of the adult population of India lacked voting rights. The party had contested three seats in Bengal, and won all of them. One CPI candidate, Somanth Lahiri, was elected to the Constituent Assembly.[26]\\r\\nDuring the period around and directly following Independence in 1947, the internal situation in the party was chaotic. The party shifted rapidly between left-wing and right-wing positions. In February 1948, at the 2nd Party Congress in Calcutta, B. T. Ranadive (BTR) was elected General Secretary of the party.[27] The conference adopted the 'Programme of Democratic Revolution'. This programme included the first mention of struggle against caste injustice in a CPI document.[28]\\r\\nIn several areas the party led armed struggles against a series of local monarchs that were reluctant to give up their power. Such insurgencies took place in Tripura, Telangana and Kerala.[citation needed] The most important rebellion took place in Telangana, against the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Communists built up a people's army and militia and controlled an area with a population of three million. The rebellion was brutally crushed and the party abandoned the policy of armed struggle. BTR was deposed and denounced as a 'left adventurist'.\\r\\nIn Manipur, the party became a force to reckon with through the agrarian struggles led by Jananeta Irawat Singh. Singh had joined CPI in 1946.[29] At the 1951 congress of the party, 'People's Democracy' was substituted by 'National Democracy' as the main slogan of the party.[30]\\r\\nCommunist Party was founded in Bihar in 1939. Post independence, communist party achieved success in Bihar (Bihar and Jharkhand). Communist party conducted movements for land reform, trade union movement was at its peak in Bihar in the sixties, seventies and eighties. Achievement of communists in Bihar placed the communist party in the forefront of left movement in India. Bihar produced some of the legendary leaders like Kishan leaders Sahjanand Saraswati and Karyanand Sharma, intellectual giants like Jagannath Sarkar, Yogendra Sharma and Indradeep Sinha, mass leaders like Chandrashekhar Singh and Sunil Mukherjee, Trade Union leaders like Kedar Das and others. It was in Bihar that JP's total revolution was exposed and communist party under the leadership of Jagannath Sarkar fought Total Revolution and exposed its hollowness. \\"Many Streams\\" Selected Essays by Jagannath Sarkar and Reminiscing Sketches, Compiled by Gautam Sarkar, Edited by Mitali Sarkar, First Published?: May 2010, Navakaranataka Publications Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore . In the Mithila region of Bihar Bhogendra Jha led the fight against the Mahants and Zamindars. He later went on the win Parliamentary elections and was MP for seven terms.\\r\\nIn early 1950s young communist leadership was uniting textile workers, bank employees and unorganized sector workers to ensure mass support in north India. National leaders like S A Dange, Chandra Rajeswara Rao and P K Vasudevan Nair were encouraging them and supporting the idea despite their differences on the execution. Firebrand Communist leaders like Homi F Dazi, Guru Radha Kishan, H L Parwana, Sarjoo Pandey, Darshan Singh Canadian and Avtaar Singh Malhotra were emerging between the masses and the working class in particular. This was the first leadership of communists that was very close to the masses and people consider them champions of the cause of the workers and the poor. In Delhi, May Day (majdoor diwas or mai diwas) was organised at Chandni Chowk Ghantaghar in such a manner that demonstrates the unity between all the factions of working classes and ignite the passion for communist movement in the northern part of India.\\r\\nIn 1952, CPI became the first leading opposition party in the Lok Sabha, while the Indian National Congress was in power. (Note - At this time, there was no CPI(M) and both were united)\\r\\nCommunist movement or CPI in particular emerged as a front runner after Guru Radha Kishan undertook a fast unto death for 24 days to promote the cause of textile workers in Delhi. Till than it was a public misconception that communists are revolutionaries with arms in their hands and workers and their families were afraid to get associated with the communists but this act mobilised general public in the favour of communist movement as a whole. During this period people with their families used to visit 'dharna sthal' to encourage CPI cadre.\\r\\nThis model of selflessness for the society worked for the CPI far more than what was expected. This trend was followed by almost all other state units of the party in the Hindi heartland. Communist Party related trade union AITUC became a prominent force to unite the workers in textile, municipal and unorganised sectors, the first labour union in unorganised sector was also emerged in the leadership of Comrade Guru Radha Kishan during this period in Delhi's Sadar Bazaar area. This movement of mass polarisation of workers in the favour of CPI worked effectively in Delhi and paved the way for great success of CPI in the elections in working class dominated areas in Delhi. Comrade Gangadhar Adhikari and E.M.S. Namboodiripad applauded this brigade of dynamic comrades for their selfless approach and organisational capabilities. This brigade of firebrand communists gained more prominence when Telangana hero Chandra Rajeswara Rao rose to be General Secretary of the Communist Party of India.\\r\\nIn the Travancore-Cochin Legislative Assembly election, 1952, Communist Party was banned, so it couldn't take part in the election process.[31] In the general elections in 1957, the CPI emerged as the largest opposition party. In 1957, the CPI won the state elections in Kerala. This was the first time that an opposition party won control over an Indian state. E. M. S. Namboodiripad became Chief Minister. At the 1957 international meeting of Communist parties in Moscow, the Communist Party of China directed criticism at the CPI for having formed a ministry in Kerala.[32]\\r\\nIdeological differences lead to the split in the party in 1964 when two different party conferences were held, one of CPI and one of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). There is a common misconception that the rift during the Sino-Indian war, when Communist Party Of India proudly supported China in the war led to the 1962 split.[citation needed] In fact, the split was leftists vs rightists, rather than internationalists vs nationalists.[citation needed] The presence of nationalists in CPI, and internationalists P. Sundarayya, Jyoti Basu, and Harkishan Singh Surjeet in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) proves this fact.\\r\\nDuring the period 1970ÿ77, CPI was allied with the Congress party. In Kerala, they formed a government together with Congress, with the CPI-leader C. Achutha Menon as Chief Minister. After the fall of the regime of Indira Gandhi, CPI reoriented itself towards cooperation with CPI(M).\\r\\nIn 1986, the CPI's leader in the Punjab and MLA in the Punjabi legislature Darshan Singh Canadian was assassinated by Sikh extremists. Then on 19 May 1987, Deepak Dhawan, General Secretary of Punjab CPI(M), was murdered. Altogether about 200 communist leaders out of which most were Sikhs were killed by Sikh extremists in Punjab.[citation needed]\\r\\nCPI was recognized by the Election Commission of India as a 'National Party'. To date, CPI happens to be the only national political party from India to have contested all the general elections using the same electoral symbol. Owing to a massive defeat in Indian general election, 2014 where the party saw its tally reduce to 1 MP, the Election Commission of India has sent a letter to CPI asking for reasons why its national party status should not be revoked.[33][34][35][36][37] If similar performance is repeated in the next election, the CPI will no longer be a national party.\\r\\nOn the national level they supported the Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government along with other parliamentary Left parties, but without taking part in it. Upon attaining power in May 2004, the United Progressive Alliance formulated a programme of action known as the Common Minimum Programme. The Left bases its support to the UPA on strict adherence to it. Provisions of the CMP mentioned to discontinue disinvestment, massive social sector outlays and an independent foreign policy.\\r\\nOn 8 July 2008, Prakash Karat, General Secretary of CPI(M) announced that the Left was withdrawing its support over the decision by the government to go ahead with the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. The Left parties combination had been a staunch advocate of not proceeding with this deal citing national interests.[38]\\r\\nIn West Bengal it participates in the Left Front. It also participated in the state government in Manipur. In Kerala the party is part of Left Democratic Front. In Tripura the party is a partner of the Left Front, which governed the state till 2018. In Tamil Nadu it is part of the Progressive Democratic Alliance. It is involved in the Left Democratic Front in Maharashtra\\r\\nThe current general secretary of CPI is S. Sudhakar Reddy.\\r\\nThe principal mass organisations of the CPI are:\\r\\n[39][40]\\r\\n*?: 12 seats in Assam and 1 in Meghalaya did not vote.[59]\\r\\nResults from the Election Commission of India website.

The proposal, using a military Redstone missile, was rejected in 1955 by the Eisenhower administration in favor of the Navy's Project Vanguard, using a booster advertised as more civilian in nature.[4][5] Following the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, the initial Project Orbiter program was revived as the Explorer program to catch up with the Soviet Union.[6]\\r\\nExplorer 1 was designed and built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), while a Jupiter-C rocket was modified by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) to accommodate a satellite payload; the resulting rocket known as the Juno I. The Jupiter-C design used for the launch had already been flight-tested in nose cone reentry tests for the Jupiter IRBM, and was modified into Juno I. Working closely together, ABMA and JPL completed the job of modifying the Jupiter-C and building Explorer 1 in 84 days. However, before work was completed, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on November 3, 1957. The U.S. Navy's attempt to put the first U.S. satellite into orbit failed with the launch of the Vanguard TV3 on December 6, 1957.[7]\\r\\nExplorer 1 was designed and built by the California Institute of Technology's JPL under the direction of Dr. William H. Pickering. It was the second satellite to carry a mission payload (Sputnik 2 was the first).\\r\\nThe total weight of the satellite was 13.37 kilograms (30.80?lb), of which 8.3?kg (18.3?lb) were instrumentation. In comparison, the first Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 weighed 83.6?kg (184?lb). The instrument section at the front end of the satellite and the empty scaled-down fourth-stage rocket casing orbited as a single unit, spinning around its long axis at 750 revolutions per minute.\\r\\nData from the scientific instruments was transmitted to the ground by two antennas. A 60 milliwatt transmitter fed a dipole antenna consisting of two fiberglass slot antennas in the body of the satellite operating on 108.03 MHz, and four flexible whips forming a turnstile antenna were fed by a 10 milliwatt transmitter operating on 108.00?MHz.[8][9]\\r\\nBecause of the limited space available and the requirements for low weight, the payload instrumentation was designed and built with simplicity and high reliability in mind, using germanium and silicon transistors in its electronics.[10] A total of 29 transistors were used in Explorer 1, plus additional ones in the Army's micrometeorite amplifier. Electrical power was provided by mercury chemical batteries that made up approximately 40 percent of the payload weight.\\r\\nThe external skin of the instrument section was sandblasted stainless steel with white stripes. Several other color schemes had been tested, resulting in backup articles, models, and photographs showing different configurations, including alternate white and green striping and blue stripes alternating with copper. The final coloration was determined by studies of shadowÿsunlight intervals based on firing time, trajectory, orbit, and inclination.\\r\\nThe Explorer 1 payload consisted of the Iowa Cosmic Ray Instrument without a tape data recorder which was not modified in time to make it onto the spacecraft. The real-time data received on the ground was therefore very sparse and puzzling showing normal counting rates and no counts at all. The later Explorer 3 mission, which included a tape data recorder in the payload, provided the additional data for confirmation of the earlier Explorer?1 data.\\r\\nThe scientific instrumentation of Explorer 1 was designed and built under the direction of Dr. James Van Allen of the University of Iowa containing:[8]\\r\\nThe Juno I rocket was launched January 31, 1958, putting Explorer 1 into orbit with a perigee of 358 kilometers (222?mi) and an apogee of 2,550 kilometers (1,580?mi) having a period of 114.8 minutes.[14][15][16] At about 1:30?a.m. ET, after confirming that Explorer 1 was indeed in orbit, a news conference was held in the Great Hall at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC to announce it to the world.[17]\\r\\nMercury batteries powered the high-power transmitter for 31 days and the low-power transmitter for 105 days. Explorer 1 stopped transmission of data on May 23, 1958[18] when its batteries died, but remained in orbit for more than 12 years. It reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean on March 31, 1970 after more than 58,000 orbits.\\r\\nExplorer 1 changed rotation axis after launch. The elongated body of the spacecraft had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body ends up in the spin state that minimizes the kinetic rotational energy for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis). This motivated the first further development of the Eulerian theory of rigid body dynamics after nearly 200 yearsto address this kind of momentum-preserving energy dissipation.[19][20]\\r\\nSometimes the instrumentation would report the expected cosmic ray count (approximately 30 counts per second) but sometimes it would show a peculiar zero counts per second. The University of Iowa (under James Van Allen) noted that all of the zero counts per second reports were from an altitude of more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200?mi) over South America, while passes at 500?km (310?mi) would show the expected level of cosmic rays. Later, after Explorer 3, it was concluded that the original Geiger counter had been overwhelmed (\\"saturated\\") by strong radiation coming from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by the Earth's magnetic field. This belt of charged particles is now known as the Van Allen radiation belt. The discovery was considered to be one of the outstanding discoveries of the International Geophysical Year.\\r\\nThe acoustic micrometeorite detector detected 145 impacts of cosmic dust in 78,750 seconds. This calculates to an average impact rate of 8.0G10?3 impacts m?2 s?1 over the twelve-day period (29 impacts per hour per square meter).[21]\\r\\nExplorer 1 was the first of the long-running Explorer program. A follow-up to the first mission, Explorer-1 [PRIME], was successfully launched aboard a Delta II rocket in late October, 2011. The PRIME was built using modern satellite construction techniques. The orbiting satellite was a backup, since the initial Explorer-1 PRIME, launched on March 4, 2011, failed to reach orbit due to a problem in the launch vehicle.[22]\\r\\nAn identically constructed flight backup of Explorer 1 is on display in the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, Milestones of Flight Gallery in Washington, DC.\\r\\nLaunch Pad 26 was deactivated in 1963, and was designated for use as a museum in 1964, the Air Force Space and Missile Museum.[23] Here too, a full-scale Explorer 1 is on display, but this one is a mockup.[24] The satellite's legacy is having been the first orbital object sent to return scientific data. Its launch happened to be 100 years to the day that the SS Great Eastern was launched. This ship was much larger than anything that came before it, and it was big enough to accomplish the task of laying out the first lasting transatlantic telegraph cable. Both events served to more closely knit the world together.","input":"When was the first satellite put in space?"},{"output":"nobles","context":"The estates of the realm, or three estates, were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in Christendom (Christian Europe) from the medieval period to early modern Europe. Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.\\r\\nThe best known system is the French Ancien Rgime (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the French Revolution (1789ÿ1799). Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobles (the Second Estate), and peasants and bourgeoisie (the Third Estate). In some regions, notably Scandinavia and Russia, burghers (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights. In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and bishops into one lordly estate with \\"commons\\" as the second estate. This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), ritters (knights), and burghers was used.\\r\\nToday the terms three estates and estates of the realm may sometimes be re-interpreted to refer to the modern separation of powers in government into the legislature, administration, and the judiciary. Additionally the term fourth estate usually refers to forces outside the established power structure (evoking medieval three-estate systems), most commonly in reference to the independent press or media. Historically, in Northern and Eastern Europe, the Fourth Estate meant rural commoners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, advancing to different social classes was uncommon and very difficult.\\r\\nThe medieval Church was an institution where social mobility was most likely up to a certain level (generally to that of vicar general or abbot/abbess for commoners). Typically, only nobility were appointed to the highest church positions (bishops, archbishops, heads of religious orders, etc.), although low nobility could aspire to the highest church positions. Since clergy could not marry, such mobility was theoretically limited to one generation. Nepotism was common in this period.\\r\\nAnother possible way to rise in social position was due to exceptional military or commercial success. Such families were rare and their rise to nobility required royal patronage at some point. However, because noble lines went extinct naturally, some number of ennoblements was necessary.\\r\\n\\"Medieval political speculation is imbued to the marrow with the idea of a structure of society based upon distinct orders,\\" Johan Huizinga observes.[1] The virtually synonymous terms estate and order designated a great variety of social realities, not at all limited to a class, Huizinga concluded applying to every social function, every trade, every recognisable grouping.\\r\\nThere are, first of all, the estates of the realm, but there are also the trades, the state of matrimony and that of virginity, the state of sin. At court there are the 'four estates of the body and mouth': bread-masters, cup-bearers, carvers, and cooks. In the Church there are sacerdotal orders and monastic orders. Finally there are the different orders of chivalry.[1]\\r\\nThis static view of society was predicated on inherited positions. Commoners were universally considered the lowest order. The higher estates' necessary dependency on the commoners' production, however, often further divided the otherwise equal common people into burghers (also known as bourgeoisie) of the realm's cities and towns, and the peasants and serfs of the realm's surrounding lands and villages. A person's estate and position within it were usually inherited from the father and his occupation, similar to a caste within that system. In many regions and realms there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates.\\r\\nLegislative bodies or advisory bodies to a monarch were traditionally grouped along lines of these estates, with the monarch above all three estates. Meetings of the estates of the realm became early legislative and judicial parliaments. Monarchs often sought to legitimize their power by requiring oaths of fealty from the estates. Today, in most countries, the estates have lost all their legal privileges, and are mainly of historical interest. The nobility may be an exception, for instance due to legislation against false titles of nobility; similarly British government well maintains the distinction- witness its House of Lords, and the House of Commons.\\r\\nOne of the earliest political pamphlets to address these ideas was called \\"What Is the Third Estate?\\" (French: Qu'est-ce que le tiers-tat?) It was written by Abb Emmanuel Joseph Sieys in January 1789, shortly before the start of the French Revolution.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, numerous geographic and ethnic kingdoms developed among the endemic peoples of Europe, affecting their day-to-day secular lives; along with those, the growing influence of the Catholic Church and its Papacy affected the ethical, moral and religious lives and decisions of all. This led to mutual dependency between the secular and religious powers for guidance and protection, but over time and with the growing power of the kingdoms, competing secular realities increasingly diverged from religious idealism and Church decisions.\\r\\nThe new lords of the land identified themselves primarily as warriors, but because new technologies of warfare were expensive, and the fighting men required substantial material resources and considerable leisure to train, these needs had to be filled. The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect.\\r\\nIn his book The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined, the French medievalist Georges Duby has shown that in the period 1023-1025 the first theorist who justified the division of European society into the three estates of the realm was Gerard of Florennes, the bishop of Cambrai.[2]\\r\\nAs a result of the Investiture Controversy of the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the powerful office of Holy Roman Emperor lost much of its religious character and retained a more nominal universal preeminence over other rulers, though it varied. The struggle over investiture and the reform movement also legitimized all secular authorities, partly on the grounds of their obligation to enforce discipline.[3]\\r\\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries thinkers argued that human society consisted of three orders: those who pray, those who fight, and those who labour. The structure of the first order, the clergy, was in place by 1200 and remained singly intact until the religious reformations of the 16th century. The very general category of those who labour (specifically, those who were not knightly warriors or nobles) diversified rapidly after the 11th century into the lively and energetic worlds of peasants, skilled artisans, merchants, financiers, lay professionals, and entrepreneurs, which together drove the European economy to its greatest achievements. The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous. Kings took pains to ensure that it did not resist their authority.[4]\\r\\nBy the 12th century, most European political thinkers agreed that monarchy was the ideal form of governance. This was because it imitated on earth the model set by God for the universe; it was the form of government of the ancient Hebrews and the Christian Biblical basis, the later Roman Empire, and also the peoples who succeeded Rome after the 4th century.[3]\\r\\nFrance under the Ancien Rgime (before the French Revolution) divided society into three estates: the First Estate (clergy); the Second Estate (nobility); and the Third Estate (commoners). The king was considered part of no estate.\\r\\nThe First Estate comprised the entire clergy, traditionally divided into \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" clergy. Although there was no formal demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from the families of the Second Estate. In the time of Louis XVI, every bishop in France was a nobleman, a situation that had not existed before the 18th century.[5]\\r\\nAt the other extreme, the \\"lower clergy\\" (about equally divided between parish priests and monks and nuns) constituted about 90 percent of the First Estate, which in 1789 numbered around 130,000 (about 0.5% of the population).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Second Estate (Fr. deuxieme tat) was the French nobility and (technically, though not in common use) royalty, other than the monarch himself, who stood outside of the system of estates.\\r\\nThe Second Estate is traditionally divided into noblesse d'pe (\\"nobility of the sword\\"), and noblesse de robe (\\"nobility of the robe\\"), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government.\\r\\nThe Second Estate constituted approximately 1.5% of France's population.[citation needed] Under the ancien rgime (\\"old rule/old government\\"), the Second Estate were exempt from the corve royale (forced labour on the roads) and from most other forms of taxation such as the gabelle (salt tax) and most important, the taille (the oldest form of direct taxation). This exemption from paying taxes led to their reluctance to reform.\\r\\nThe Third Estate comprised all of those who were not members of the above and can be divided into two groups, urban and rural, together making up 98% of France's population.[citation needed] The urban included wage-labourers. The rural included free peasants (who owned their own land) who could be prosperous and villeins (serfs, or peasants working on a noble's land). The free peasants paid disproportionately high taxes compared to the other Estates and were unhappy because they wanted more rights. In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's unequal status all the more glaring.\\r\\nThere were an estimated 27 million people in the Third Estate when the French Revolution started.\\r\\nThey had the hard life of physical labour and food shortages.[citation needed] Most were born within this group and died as a part of it, too. It was extremely rare for people of this ascribed status to make it out into another estate. Those who did so managed as a result of either being recognized for their extraordinary bravery in a battle or entering religious life.[6] A few commoners were able to marry into the second estate, but this was a rare occurrence.[6]\\r\\nThe first Estates General (not to be confused with a \\"class of citizen\\") was actually a general citizen assembly that was called by Philip IV in 1302.\\r\\nIn the period leading up to the Estates General of 1789, France was in the grip of an unmanageable public debt (nearly 3.56 million livres).[7] In May 1776, finance minister Turgot was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, Jacques Necker, a foreigner, was appointed Comptroller-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.[8]), terrible inflation and widespread food scarcity (a huge famine in the winter of 1788-89). This led to widespread popular discontent and produced a group of Third Estate representatives (612 exactly) pressing a comparatively radical set of reforms, much of it in alignment with the goals of Finance Minister Jacques Necker, but very much against the wishes of Louis XVI's court and many of the hereditary nobles forming his Second Estate allies (at least allies against taking more taxes upon themselves and keeping the unequal taxation on the commoners).\\r\\nWhen he could not persuade them to rubber-stamp his 'ideal program', Louis XVI sought to dissolve the Estates-General, but the Third Estate held out for their right to representation. The lower clergy (and some nobles and upper clergy) eventually sided with the Third Estate, and the King was forced to yield. Thus, the Estate-General meeting was an invitation to revolution.\\r\\nBy June, when continued impasses led to further deterioration in relations, the Estates-General was reconstituted first as the National Assembly (June 17, 1789) seeking a solution for the realm independent of the King's management of the meetings of the Estates General which occasionally continued to meet. These self-organized meetings are today defined as the epoch event beginning the historical epoch (era) of the French Revolution, during which ÿ after several more weeks of civil unrest ÿ the body assumed a new status as a revolutionary legislature, the National Constituent Assembly (July 9, 1789).[9]\\r\\nThis unitary body composed of the former representatives of the three estates stepping up to govern along with an emergency committee in the power vacuum existing after the Bourbon monarchy fled Paris. Among the Assembly was Maximilien de Robespierre, an influential member of the Jacobins who would years later become instrumental in the turbulent period of violence and political upheaval in France known as the Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 ÿ 28 July 1794).[9]\\r\\nWhilst the estates were never formulated in a way that prevented social mobility, the English (subsequently the British) parliament was long based along the classic estate lines being composed on the \\"Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons\\". The tradition where the Lords Spiritual and Temporal sat separately from the Commons began during the reign of Edward III in the 14th century.\\r\\nNotwithstanding the House of Lords Act 1999, the British Parliament still recognises the existence of the three estates: the Commons in the House of Commons, the nobility in the House of Lords, and the clergy in the form of the Church of England bishops also entitled to sit in the upper House as the Lords Spiritual.\\r\\nThe members of the Parliament of Scotland were collectively referred to as the Three Estates (Older Scots: Thre Estaitis), also known as the community of the realm, and until 1690 composed of:\\r\\nThe First Estate was overthrown during the Glorious Revolution and the accession of William III.[10] The Second Estate was then split into two to retain the division into three.\\r\\nA Shire Commissioner was the closest equivalent of the English office of Member of Parliament, namely a commoner or member of the lower nobility. Because the Parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same chamber, as opposed to the separate English House of Lords and House of Commons.\\r\\nThe Parliament also had University constituencies (see Ancient universities of Scotland). The system was also adopted by the Parliament of England when James VI ascended to the English throne. It was believed that the universities were affected by the decisions of Parliament and ought therefore to have representation in it. This continued in the Parliament of Great Britain after 1707 and the Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1950.[11]\\r\\nThe Estates in Sweden (including Finland) and later also Russia's Grand Duchy of Finland were the two higher estates, nobility and clergy, and the two lower estates, burghers and land-owning peasants. Each were free men, and had specific rights and responsibilities, and the right to send representatives to the Riksdag of the Estates. At the Riksdag, each Estate voted as a single body. Since early 18th century, a bill needed the approval of at least three Estates to pass, and constitutional amendments required the approval of all Estates. Prior to the 18th century, the King had the right to cast a deciding vote if the Estates were split evenly.\\r\\nAfter Russia's conquest of Finland in 1809, a Finnish House of Nobility was codified in 1818 in accordance with the old Swedish law of 1723. However the Diet of Finland and its four estates was not convened until 1863.\\r\\nThere was also a population outside the estates. Unlike in other areas, people had no \\"default\\" estate, and were not peasants unless they came from a land-owner's family. A summary of this division is:\\r\\nIn Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property. Nevertheless, many of the leading politicians of the 19th century continued to be drawn from the old estates, in that they were either noblemen themselves, or represented agricultural and urban interests. Ennoblements continued even after the estates had lost their political importance, with the last ennoblement of explorer Sven Hedin taking place in 1902; this practice was formally abolished with the adoption of the new Constitution January 1, 1975, while the status of the House of Nobility continued to be regulated in law until 2003.\\r\\nIn Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772. However, at the start of the 20th century most of the population did not belong to any Estate and had no political representation. A particularly large class were the rent farmers, who did not own the land they cultivated but had to work in the land-owner's farm to pay their rent (unlike Russia, there were no slaves or serfs.) Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system.\\r\\nThe political system was reformed as a result of the Finnish general strike of 1905, with the last Diet instituting a new constitutional law to create the modern parliamentary system, ending the political privileges of the estates. The post-independence constitution of 1919 forbade ennoblement, and all tax privileges were abolished in 1920. The privileges of the estates were officially and finally abolished in 1995,[12] although in legal practice, the privileges had long been unenforceable. As in Sweden, the nobility has not been officially abolished and records of nobility are still voluntarily maintained by the Finnish House of Nobility.\\r\\nIn Finland, it is still illegal and punishable by jail time (up to one year) to defraud into marriage by declaring a false name or estate (Rikoslaki 18 luku  1/Strafflagen 18 kap.  1).\\r\\nThe Low Countries, which until the late sixteenth century consisted of several counties, prince bishoprics, duchies etc. in the area that is now modern Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, had no States General until 1464, when Duke Philip of Burgundy assembled the first States General in Bruges. Later in the 15th and 16th centuries Brussels became the place where the States General assembled. On these occasions deputies from the States of the various provinces (as the counties, prince-bishoprics and duchies were called) asked for more liberties. For this reason, the States General were not assembled very often.\\r\\nAs a consequence of the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and the events that followed afterwards, the States General declared that they no longer obeyed King Philip II of Spain, who was also overlord of the Netherlands. After the reconquest of the southern Netherlands (roughly Belgium and Luxemburg), the States General of the Dutch Republic first assembled permanently in Middelburg, and in The Hague from 1585 onward. Without a king to rule the country, the States General became the sovereign power. It was the level of government where all things were dealt with that were of concern to all the seven provinces that became part of the Republic of the United Netherlands.\\r\\nDuring that time the States General were formed by representatives of the States (i.e. provincial parliaments) of the seven provinces. In each States (a plurale tantum) sat representatives of the nobility and the cities (the clergy were no longer represented; in Friesland the peasants were indirectly represented by the Grietmannen).\\r\\nIn the Southern Netherlands, the last meetings of the States General loyal to the Habsburgs took place in the Estates General of 1600 and the Estates General of 1632.\\r\\nAs a government, the States General of the Dutch Republic were abolished in 1795. A new parliament was created, called Nationale Vergadering (National Assembly). It no longer consisted of representatives of the States, let alone the Estates: all men were considered equal under the 1798 Constitution. Eventually, the Netherlands became part of the French Empire under Napoleon (1810: La Hollande est reunie  l'Empire).\\r\\nAfter regaining independence in November 1813, the name \\"States General\\" was resurrected for a legislature constituted in 1814 and elected by the States-Provincial. In 1815, when the Netherlands were united with Belgium and Luxemburg, the States General were divided into two chambers: the First Chamber and the Second Chamber. The members of the First Chamber were appointed for life by the King, while the members of the Second Chamber were elected by the members of the States Provincial. The States General resided in The Hague and Brussels in alternate years until 1830, when, as a result of the Belgian Revolution, The Hague became once again the sole residence of the States General, Brussels instead hosting the newly founded Belgian Parliament.\\r\\nFrom 1848 on, the Dutch Constitution provides that members of the Second Chamber be elected by the people (at first only by a limited portion of the male population; universal male and female suffrage exists since 1919), while the members of the First Chamber are chosen by the members of the States Provincial. As a result, the Second Chamber became the most important. The First Chamber is also called Senate. This however, is not a term used in the Constitution.\\r\\nOccasionally the First and Second Chamber meet in a Verenigde Vergadering (Joint Session), for instance on Prinsjesdag, the annual opening of the parliamentary year, and when a new king is inaugurated.\\r\\nThe Holy Roman Empire had the Imperial Diet (Reichstag). The clergy was represented by the independent prince-bishops, prince-archbishops and prince-abbots of the many monasteries. The nobility consisted of independent aristocratic rulers: secular prince-electors, kings, dukes, margraves, counts and others. Burghers consisted of representatives of the independent imperial cities. Many peoples whose territories within the Holy Roman Empire had been independent for centuries had no representatives in the Imperial Diet, and this included the Imperial Knights and independent villages. The power of the Imperial Diet was limited, despite efforts of centralization.\\r\\nLarge realms of the nobility or clergy had estates of their own that could wield great power in local affairs. Power struggles between ruler and estates were comparable to similar events in the history of the British and French parliaments.\\r\\nThe Swabian League, a significant regional power in its part of Germany during the 15th Century, also had its own kind of Estates, a governing Federal Council comprising three Colleges: those of Princes, Cities, and Knights.\\r\\nIn the late Russian Empire the estates were called sosloviyes. The four major estates were: nobility (dvoryanstvo), clergy, rural dwellers, and urban dwellers, with a more detailed stratification therein. The division in estates was of mixed nature: traditional, occupational, as well as formal: for example, voting in Duma was carried out by estates. Russian Empire Census recorded the reported estate of a person.\\r\\nThe Parliament of Catalonia was first established in 1283 as the Catalan Courts (Corts Catalanes), according to American historian Thomas Bisson, and it has been considered by several historians as a model of medieval parliament. For instance, English historian of constitutionalism Charles Howard McIlwain wrote that the General Courts of Catalonia, during the 14th century, had a more defined organization and met more regularly than the parliaments of England or France.[13]\\r\\nThe roots of the parliament institution in Catalonia are in the Sanctuary and Truce Assemblies (assemblees de pau i treva) that started in the 11th century. The members of the parliament of Catalonia were organized in the Three Estates (Catalan: Tres Estats):\\r\\nThe parliament institution was abolished in 1716, together with the rest of institutions of Catalonia, after the War of the Spanish Succession.\\r\\nLocation specific:\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"Who are the members of the second estate?"},{"output":"30 September 1947","context":"The United Nations member states are the 193 sovereign states that are members of the United Nations (UN) and have equal representation in the UN General Assembly.[2] The UN is the world's largest intergovernmental organization, ahead of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.[3]\\r\\n The criteria for admission of new members to the UN are set out in Chapter II, Article 4 of the UN Charter:[4]\\r\\nA recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council's fifteen members, with none of the five permanent members using their veto power. The Security Council's recommendation must then be approved in the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority vote.[5]\\r\\nIn principle, only sovereign states can become UN members, and currently all UN members are sovereign states. Although five members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, all subsequently became fully independent between 1946 and 1991. Because a state can only be admitted to membership in the UN by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly, a number of states that are considered sovereign according to the Montevideo Convention are not members of the UN. This is because the UN does not consider them to possess sovereignty, mainly due to the lack of international recognition or due to opposition from one of the permanent members.\\r\\nIn addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states to become observers at the UN General Assembly (currently two: the Holy See and Palestine), allowing them to participate and speak in General Assembly meetings, but not vote. Observers are generally intergovernmental organizations and international organizations and entities whose statehood or sovereignty is not precisely defined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the Republic of China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and a majority of the other signatories.[7] A total of 51 original members (or founding members) joined that year; 50 of them signed the Charter at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, while Poland, which was not represented at the conference, signed it on 15 October 1945.[8][9]\\r\\nThe original members of the United Nations were: France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Byelorussia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.[9]\\r\\nAmong the original members, 49 are either still UN members or had their memberships in the UN continued by a successor state (see table below); for example, the membership of the Soviet Union was continued by the Russian Federation after its dissolution (see the section Former members: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics). The other two original members, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (i.e., the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), had been dissolved and their memberships in the UN not continued from 1992 by any one successor state (see the sections Former members: Czechoslovakia and Former members: Yugoslavia).[9]\\r\\nAt the time of UN's founding, the seat of China in the UN was held by the Republic of China, but as a result of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971, it is now held by the People's Republic of China (see the section Former members: Republic of China (Taiwan)).\\r\\nA number of the original members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, and only gained full independence later:[10]\\r\\nThe current members and their dates of admission are listed below with their official designations used by the United Nations.[12][13]\\r\\nThe alphabetical order by the member states' official designations is used to determine the seating arrangement of the General Assembly sessions, where a draw is held each year to select a member state as the starting point.[14] Several members use their full official names in their official designations and thus are sorted out of order from their common names: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (a provisional reference used for all purposes within the UN, and listed under T), and the United Republic of Tanzania.\\r\\nThe member states can be sorted by their official designations and dates of admission by clicking on the buttons in the header of the columns. See related sections on former members by clicking on the links in the column See also.\\r\\nOriginal members are listed with blue background.\\r\\nThe Republic of China (ROC) joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, and as set out by the United Nations Charter, Chapter V, Article 23, became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[18] In 1949, as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang-led ROC government lost effective control of mainland China and relocated to the island of Taiwan, and the Communist Party-led government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), declared on 1 October 1949, took control of mainland China. The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China; however, the Government of the Republic of China continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of Taiwan and a number of smaller islands compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of mainland China. As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China, proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades, as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members.[citation needed] Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the One-China policy.[19]\\r\\nBy the 1970s, a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count. On 25 October 1971, the 21st time the United Nations General Assembly debated on the PRC's admission into the UN,[20] United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 was adopted, by which it recognized that \\"the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council,\\" and decided \\"to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\\"[21] This effectively transferred the seat of China in the UN, including its permanent seat on the Security Council, from the ROC to the PRC, and expelled the ROC from the UN. From the United Nations' perspective the \\"Republic of China\\" is not a former member. No UN member was expelled in 1971. Rather, the credentials of one Chinese delegation (from Taipei) were rejected and the credentials of another Chinese delegation (from Beijing) were accepted.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition to losing its seat in the UN, the UN Secretary-General concluded from the resolution that the General Assembly considered Taiwan to be a province of China. Consequently, the Secretary-General decided that it was not permitted for the ROC to become a party to treaties deposited with it.[22]\\r\\nIn 1993 the ROC began campaigning to rejoin the UN separately from the People's Republic of China. A number of options were considered, including seeking membership in the specialized agencies, applying for observer status, applying for full membership, or having resolution 2758 revoked to reclaim the seat of China in the UN.[23]\\r\\nEvery year from 1993ÿ2006, UN member states submitted a memorandum to the UN Secretary-General requesting that the UN General Assembly consider allowing the ROC to resume participating in the United Nations.[24] This approach was chosen, rather than a formal application for membership, because it could be enacted by the General Assembly, while a membership application would need Security Council approval, where the PRC held a veto.[23] Early proposals recommended admitting the ROC with parallel representation over China, along with the People's Republic of China, pending eventual reunification, citing examples of other divided countries which had become separate UN member states, such as East and West Germany and North and South Korea. Later proposals emphasized that the ROC was a separate state, over which the PRC had no effective sovereignty. These proposed resolutions referred to the ROC under a variety of names: \\"Republic of China in Taiwan\\" (1993ÿ94), \\"Republic of China on Taiwan\\" (1995ÿ97, 1999ÿ2002), \\"Republic of China\\" (1998), \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\" (2003) and \\"Taiwan\\" (2004ÿ06).\\r\\nHowever, all fourteen attempts were unsuccessful as the General Assembly's General Committee declined to put the issue on the Assembly's agenda for debate, under strong opposition from the PRC.[25]\\r\\nWhile all these proposals were vague, requesting the ROC be allowed to participate in UN activities without specifying any legal mechanism, in 2007 the ROC submitted a formal application under the name \\"Taiwan\\" for full membership in the UN.[26] However, the application was rejected by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs citing General Assembly Resolution 2758,[27] without being forwarded to the Security Council. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon stated that:\\r\\nThe position of the United Nations is that the People's Republic of China is representing the whole of China as the sole and legitimate representative Government of China. The decision until now about the wish of the people in Taiwan to join the United Nations has been decided on that basis. The resolution (General Assembly Resolution 2758) that you just mentioned is clearly mentioning that the Government of China is the sole and legitimate Government and the position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China.[28]\\r\\nResponding to the UN's rejection of its application, the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that since General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN, it does not prevent Taiwan's participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation.[29] The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly,[30] contrary to UN's standard procedure (Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59).[31] On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer, praised that UN's decision \\"was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states' universal adherence to the one-China principle\\".[32] A group of UN member states put forward a draft resolution for that fall's UN General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider the application.[26]\\r\\nThe following year two referendums in Taiwan on the government's attempts to regain participation at the UN did not pass due to low turnout. That fall the ROC took a new approach, with its allies submitting a resolution requesting that the \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\" be allowed to have \\"meaningful participation\\" in the UN specialized agencies.[33] Again the issue was not put on the Assembly's agenda.[25] In 2009, the ROC chose not to bring the issue of its participation in the UN up for debate at the General Assembly for the first time since it began the campaign in 1993.[34]\\r\\nIn May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the World Health Organization to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \\"Chinese Taipei\\". This was the ROC's first participation in an event organized by a UN-affiliated agency since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before.[35]\\r\\nThe Republic of China is officially recognized by?19?UN member states and the Holy See. It maintains unofficial diplomatic relations with around 100 nations, including the United States and Japan.\\r\\nCzechoslovakia joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, with its name changed to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 20 April 1990. Upon the imminent dissolution of Czechoslovakia, in a letter dated 10 December 1992, its Permanent Representative informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic would cease to exist on 31 December 1992 and that the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as successor states, would apply for membership in the UN. Neither state sought sole successor state status. Both states were admitted to the UN on 19 January 1993.[36]\\r\\nBoth the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) were admitted to the UN on 18 September 1973. Through the accession of the East German federal states to the Federal Republic of Germany, effective from 3 October 1990, the territory of the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, today simply known as Germany. Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany continued being a member of the UN while the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist.[36]\\r\\nThe Federation of Malaya joined the United Nations on 17 September 1957. On 16 September 1963, its name was changed to Malaysia, following the formation of Malaysia from Singapore, North Borneo (now Sabah), Sarawak and the Federation of Malaya. Singapore became an independent State on 9 August 1965 and a Member of the United Nations on 21 September 1965.\\r\\nTanganyika was admitted to the UN on 14 December 1961, and Zanzibar was admitted to the UN on 16 December 1963. Following the ratification on 26 April 1964 of the Articles of Union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar, the two states merged to form the single member \\"United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar\\", with its name changed to the United Republic of Tanzania on 1 November 1964.[36][6]\\r\\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, and as set out by the United Nations Charter, Chapter V, Article 23, became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[18] Upon the imminent dissolution of the USSR, in a letter dated 24 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Federation, informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the membership of the USSR in the Security Council and all other UN organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[36]\\r\\nThe other fourteen independent states established from the former Soviet Republics were all admitted to the UN:\\r\\nBoth Egypt and Syria joined the UN as original members on 24 October 1945. Following a plebiscite on 21 February 1958, the United Arab Republic was established by a union of Egypt and Syria and continued as a single member. On 13 October 1961, Syria, having resumed its status as an independent state, resumed its separate membership in the UN. Egypt continued as a UN member under the name of the United Arab Republic, until it reverted to its original name on 2 September 1971. Syria changed its name to the Syrian Arab Republic on 14 September 1971.[36]\\r\\nYemen (i.e., North Yemen) was admitted to the UN on 30 September 1947; Southern Yemen (i.e., South Yemen) was admitted to the UN on 14 December 1967, with its name changed to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen on 30 November 1970, and was later referred to as Democratic Yemen. On 22 May 1990, the two states merged to form the Republic of Yemen, which continued as a single member under the name Yemen.[36]\\r\\nThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, referred to as Yugoslavia, joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945. By 1992, it had been effectively dissolved into five independent states, which were all subsequently admitted to the UN:\\r\\nDue to the dispute over its legal successor states, the member state \\"Yugoslavia\\", referring to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, remained on the official roster of UN members for many years after its effective dissolution.[36] Following the admission of all five states as new UN members, \\"Yugoslavia\\" was removed from the official roster of UN members.\\r\\nThe government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, established on 28 April 1992 by the remaining Yugoslav republics of Montenegro and Serbia,[40] claimed itself as the legal successor state of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia;[41] however, on 30 May 1992, United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 was adopted, by which it imposed international sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its role in the Yugoslav Wars, and noted that \\"the claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted,\\"[42] and on 22 September 1992, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1 was adopted, by which it considered that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations,\\" and therefore decided that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly\\".[43][44] The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to comply with the resolution for many years, but following the ousting of President Slobodan Milo?evi? from office, it applied for membership, and was admitted to the UN on 1 November 2000.[39] On 4 February 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had its official name changed to Serbia and Montenegro, following the adoption and promulgation of the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro by the Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.[45]\\r\\nOn the basis of a referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence from Serbia and Montenegro on 3 June 2006. In a letter dated on the same day, the President of Serbia informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the UN was being continued by Serbia, following Montenegro's declaration of independence, in accordance with the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro.[46] Montenegro was admitted to the UN on 28 June 2006.[47]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the Kosovo War, the territory of Kosovo, then an autonomous province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was put under the interim administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo on 10 June 1999. On 17 February 2008 it declared independence, but this has not been recognised by Serbia. The Republic of Kosovo is not a member of the UN, but is a member of the International Monetary Fund[48] and the World Bank Group,[49] both specialized agencies in the United Nations System. The Republic of Kosovo is recognised by?112?UN member states, including three of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (France, the United Kingdom, and the United States), while the other twoChina and Russiado not recognise Kosovo. On 22 July 2010, the International Court of Justice, the primary judicial organ of the UN, issued an advisory opinion, ruling that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not in violation of international law.[50]\\r\\nA member state may be suspended or expelled from the UN, according to the United Nations Charter. From Chapter II, Article 5:[4]\\r\\nA Member of the United Nations against which preventive or enforcement action has been taken by the Security Council may be suspended from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. The exercise of these rights and privileges may be restored by the Security Council.\\r\\nFrom Article 6:[4]\\r\\nA Member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.\\r\\nSince its inception, no member state has been suspended or expelled from the UN under Articles 5 and 6. However, in a few cases, states were suspended or expelled from participating in UN activities by means other than Articles 5 and 6:\\r\\nSince the inception of the UN, only one member state (excluding those that dissolved or merged with other member states) has unilaterally withdrawn from the UN. During the IndonesiaÿMalaysia confrontation, and in response to the election of Malaysia as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, in a letter dated 20 January 1965, Indonesia informed the United Nations Secretary-General that it had decided \\"at this stage and under the present circumstances\\" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of President Sukarno, in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision \\"to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly\\". On 28 September 1966, the United Nations General Assembly took note of the decision of the Government of Indonesia and the President invited the representatives of that country to take their seats in the Assembly.[36]\\r\\nUnlike suspension and expulsion, no express provision is made in the United Nations Charter of whether or how a member can legally withdraw from the UN (largely to prevent the threat of withdrawal from being used as a form of political blackmail, or to evade obligations under the Charter, similar to withdrawals that weakened the UN's predecessor, the League of Nations),[51] or on whether a request for readmission by a withdrawn member should be treated the same as an application for membership, i.e., requiring Security Council as well as General Assembly approval. Indonesia's return to the UN would suggest that this is not required; however, scholars have argued that the course of action taken by the General Assembly was not in accordance with the Charter from a legal point of view.[53]\\r\\nIn addition to the member states, there are two non-member permanent observer states: the Holy See and the State of Palestine.[54]\\r\\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta, while not a state, has observer status at the UN and maintains diplomatic relations with 107 countries.[66][67]\\r\\nA number of states were also granted observer status before being admitted to the UN as full members (see United Nations General Assembly observers for the full list).[68][69][70] The most recent case of an observer state becoming a member state was Switzerland, which was admitted in 2002.[71]\\r\\nA European Union institution, the European Commission, was granted observer status at the UNGA through Resolution 3208 in 1974. The Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 resulted in the delegates being accredited directly to the EU.[72] It was accorded full rights in the General Assembly, bar the right to vote and put forward candidates, via UNGA Resolution A/RES/65/276 on 10 May 2011.[73] It is the only non-state party to over 50 multilateral conventions, and has participated as a full member in every way except for having a vote in a number of UN conferences.[74]\\r\\nThe sovereignty status of Western Sahara is in dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front. Most of the territory is controlled by Morocco, the remainder (the Free Zone) by the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, proclaimed by the Polisario Front. Western Sahara is listed by the UN as a \\"non-self-governing territory\\".[75]\\r\\nThe Cook Islands and Niue, which are both associated states of New Zealand, are not members of the UN, but are members of specialized agencies of the UN such as WHO[76] and UNESCO,[77] and have had their \\"full treaty-making capacity\\" recognized by United Nations Secretariat in 1992 and 1994 respectively.[78][79] They have since become parties to a number of international treaties which the UN Secretariat acts as a depositary for, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[80] and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,[81] and are treated as non-member states.[82][78] Both the Cook Islands and Niue have expressed a desire to become a UN member state, but New Zealand has said that they would not support the application without a change in their constitutional relationship, in particular their right to New Zealand citizenship.[83][84]","input":"When did pakistan become the member of uno?"},{"output":"Madonna","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna (retitled Madonna: The First Album for the 1985 re-release) is the debut album by American singer Madonna, released on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records. After having established herself as a singer in downtown New York City, Madonna was signed by Sire president Seymour Stein, due to the success of her debut single, \\"Everybody\\" (1982). She became the sole writer for most of the album's tracks, and chose Reggie Lucas as its primary producer. Unhappy with Lucas's production outputs, she invited John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez to complete the album, who remixed three tracks and produced \\"Holiday\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna has an upbeat synthetic disco sound, using new technology of the time, including the Linn drum machine, Moog bass and Oberheim OB-X synthesizer. She sang in a bright, girlish timbre, with lyrics about love and relationships. To promote the album, Madonna performed one-off gigs in clubs and on television in the United States and United Kingdom throughout 1983 and 1984, followed by The Virgin Tour in 1985. Five singles were released, including the international top-ten hits \\"Holiday\\", \\"Lucky Star\\", and \\"Borderline\\". Their accompanying music videos were released on the Madonna video compilation, which became the best-selling videocassette of 1985 in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200, and was certified five-time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies across the United States. It reached the top ten of the charts in Australia, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and sold more than 10?million copies worldwide. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics and was ranked fifth on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \\"Top 100 Best Albums of Past 25 Years\\" in 2008. The album has been credited for setting the standard of dance-pop for decades afterward, and for pointing the direction for numerous female artists of the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, Madonna, aged 24, was living in New York, and trying to set up her music career.[1] She was joined by her Detroit boyfriend Steve Bray who became the drummer of her band, the Breakfast Club, which played generally hard-rock music. Soon they abandoned playing songs in the hard-rock genre, and got signed by a music management company called Gotham Records, planning to move in a new musical direction.[2] They decided to pursue the funk genre, but the record company was not happy with their musical talents and they were dropped from the label; Madonna and Bray left the band also.[1] Meanwhile, she had written and developed some songs on her own. She carried rough tapes of three of the songs, \\"Everybody\\", \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" and \\"Burning Up\\". At that time she was frequenting the Danceteria nightclub in New York. It was here that Madonna convinced the DJ Mark Kamins to play \\"Everybody\\".[1] The song was received positively by the crowd, and Kamins decided that he should get Madonna a record deal, on the understanding that he would get to produce the single.[1] He took her to his boss Chris Blackwell, who owned Island Records, but Blackwell refused to sign Madonna so they approached Sire Records.[3] Michael Rosenblatt, who worked in the artists and repertoire department of Sire, offered Madonna $5,000 in advance, plus $1,000 in royalties, for each song she wrote.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna was ultimately signed for two 12\\" singles by the President of Sire, Seymour Stein, who was impressed by her singing,[4] after listening to \\"Everybody\\" at a hospital in Lenox Hill where he was admitted.[5] The 12\\" version of \\"Everybody\\" was produced by Mark Kamins at Blank Tapes Studios in New York, who took over the production work from Steve Bray.[5] The new recording ran 5:56 on one side and 9:23 for the dub version on the reverse side. Madonna and Kamins had to record the single at their own cost.[6] Arthur Baker, friend of Mark Kamins, guided him through the role of a music producer and provided him with studio musician Fred Zarr who played keyboards on the track.[7] Zarr became one of the common musical threads on the album by eventually performing on every track. Due to restrained budget the recording was done hurriedly. Madonna and Kamins had difficulty in understanding each other's inputs for the sessions. Rosenblatt wanted to release \\"Everybody\\" with \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" on the other side, but later changed his mind and put \\"Everybody\\" on both sides of the vinyl record after hearing the recorded version of \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\".[5] The single was commercially released in October 1982 and became a dance hit in the United States. This led to Sire signing Madonna for an LP and two more singles.[4][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBenitez talking about Madonna and the album.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album was primarily recorded at Sigma Sound Studios in New York City.[11] Madonna opted not to work with either Kamins or Bray, but chose Reggie Lucas, a Warner Bros. producer. Bray decided to push her in the musical direction of pop, and recorded the song \\"Burning Up\\" with her. However, Madonna still did not have enough material to generate a full album. The songs available were, \\"Lucky Star\\", a new version of \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\", \\"Think of Me\\" and \\"I Know It\\". Lucas brought another two songs to the project, \\"Physical Attraction\\" and \\"Borderline\\".[9] As he recorded the tracks he deviated considerably from the original versions of the demos. One such altered song was \\"Lucky Star\\". The song was written by Madonna for Kamins, who previously promised to play the track at Danceteria.[5] However, the track was instead used by Madonna for the album, which she planned to call Lucky Star. She believed that \\"Lucky Star\\", along with \\"Borderline\\", were the perfect foundation for her album.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nProblems arose between her and Lucas during the recording of the songs. Madonna was unhappy with the way the final versions turned out. According to Madonna, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the songs.[12] This led to a dispute between the two and, after finishing the album, Lucas left the project without tailoring the songs to Madonna's specifications; hence she called John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez, a DJ at Funhouse disco, to remix the available tracks. In the meantime, due to a conflict of interest, Bray had sold \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\" to an act on another label, rendering it unavailable for Madonna's project.[9] It was Benitez who discovered a new song, written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of the pop group Pure Energy.[5] The song, titled \\"Holiday\\", had been turned down by Phyllis Hyman and Mary Wilson, formerly of The Supremes.[13] Benitez and Madonna sent the demo to their friend, Fred Zarr so he could embellish the arrangement and program the synthesizer lines.[5] After vocals were recorded by Madonna, Benitez spent four days trying to enhance the commercial appeal of the track before the April 1983 deadline.[9][13] Just before it was completed, Madonna and Benitez met Fred Zarr at Sigma Sound in Manhattan, where Zarr added the now familiar piano solo towards the end of the track.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to AllMusic, Madonnna is a dance-pop and post-disco album.[14][15] The overall sound of the album is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the OB-X synthesizer. This equipment has dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as somewhat harsh.[16] Madonna commented on her debut album: \\"The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realize how crucial it was for me to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [first] album. I wish I could have got a little more variety there.\\"[16] The album starts with the song \\"Lucky Star\\", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps.[16] A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound.[16] The song revolves around the \\"Starlight, starbright\\" hook for more than a minute, before going to the chorus. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Borderline\\" is a sentimental track, talking about a love that is never quite fulfilled.[10] According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernndez and his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the lyrics of the song like \\"Something in the way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free\\" depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism.[17] Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentation.[10] It opens with a keyboard rich intro and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr.[16] Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture.[16] The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as Elton John's musical style during the mid-seventies.[16] The chord sequences cite from BachmanÿTurner Overdrive's song \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\" while the synth phases display her typical musical style.[18] The third track \\"Burning Up\\" has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, single guitar and Linn drum machine.[18] The drum beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer Phil Collins.[18] It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time.[19] The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the bridge consists of a series of double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to do for her lover, and that she is individualistic and shameless.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next track \\"I Know It\\" has a gentler swing to it and features music from piano, a saxophone, synth phrases while having an offbeat chord change.[18] \\"Holiday\\" consists of a four-bar sequence, featuring instrumentation from guitars, electronic drums and handclaps from the Oberheim DMX, cowbell played by Madonna and a synthesized string arrangement. A side-by-side repetitive progression is achieved by making use of the chorus.[20] Towards the end of the song, a change in the arrangement happens, where a piano break is heard. Lyrically, the song expresses the universal sentiment that everybody needs a holiday.[20] In \\"Think of Me\\", Madonna warns her erring lover that he should pay her attention or else she would leave. The song consists of beats from the Linn drum machine and a saxophone interlude. \\"Physical Attraction\\" is a medium paced track, with synth bass, a guitar line, sounds of a brass and Madonna singing in a shrill voice, about the attraction between herself and a boy.[20] The last song on the album is \\"Everybody\\", which starts with a heavily synthesized and spoken introduction, with Madonna taking a loud intake of breath.[21] She displayed her bubblegum-pop like voice in the song, which was also doubletracked.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album was first released in the United States on July 27, 1983 by Sire Records.[22] It was originally slated to be titled Lucky Star, after the track of the same name, but eventually titled simply Madonna, perhaps that this singular name could have star power.[5] The album's artwork was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg.[11][23] The front cover shows Madonna with short-cropped platinum hair, wearing a number of black rubber bangles on her hands and a dog chain around her throat. Her navel is also prominent on the inner sleeve of the album. Madonna commented: \\"The picture inside the dust of sleeve of my first album has me, like, in this Betty Boop pose with my belly button showing. Then when people reviews the album, they kept talking about my cute belly button. [...] I think there are other unobvious places on the body that are sexy and the stomach is kind of innocent.\\"[24] Regarding the album photoshot, Gary Heery recalled:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"[Madonna] arrived at my Broadway studio in New York with a small bag of clothes and jewelery, and no entourage. Then, in front of the camera she was explosive, like a great model, but with her own unique style. She came over the next day to see some prints and the proofs, and there was shot after shot to choose from. We agreed on every choice and whittled it down to the album cover images. I had no idea what I had just been a party to.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album was re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as Madonna: The First Album with a different artwork created by photographer George Holy. The cover features Madonna in similar style of dress to the original cover but this time with crucifix as her earrings. Madonna's trademark style was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and fans, with her crucifix accessories becoming the jewelry of the moment.[5] Madonna said that wearing a crucifix is \\"kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name.\\"[5] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\".[25] Madonna dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good until the release of the album. In an interview with Time magazine, Madonna said: \\"My father had never believed that what I was doing here [in New York] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn't until my first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna had promoted the album throughout 1983ÿ84 by performing a series of \\"track dates\\", one-off gigs. These shows were done at New York City and London clubs like Danceteria and Camden Palace and on American and British television programs like American Bandstand and Top of the Pops.[27] On American Bandstand, Madonna performed the track \\"Holiday\\" and told interviewer Dick Clark that she wanted \\"to rule the world.\\" John Mitchell from MTV said that the appearance \\"remains one of her most legendary.\\"[28] The album's singles were later performed on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It was Madonna's first concert tour and visited North American dates. The Virgin Tour received mixed reception from critics, but was a commercial success. As soon as the tour was announced, tickets were sold out everywhere.[29] Macy's New York department store was flooded with buyers, who bought the tour merchandise like the crucifix earrings and fingerless gloves.[30] After its end, the Virgin Tour was reported to have grossed over $5?million ($11.38?million in 2017 dollars[31]), with Billboard Boxscore reporting a gross of $3.3?million ($7.51?million in 2017 dollars[31]). The tour was recorded and released in VHS, as Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour. Later authors have looked back at the tour and commented that it was clear that \\"[Madonna] was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon.\\"[32] Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss noted the clothes and fashion in the tour and said, \\"Virgin Tour established Madonna as the hottest figure in pop music.\\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna released five singles from the album, although two of those singles actually preceded the album's release by several months. \\"Everybody\\" was released on October 6, 1982, as Madonna's debut single; at this point, the rest of the Madonna album had not yet been recorded or even conceived of. Musically incorporating R&B infused beats, \\"Everybody\\" portrayed the image of Madonna as a black artist, since her picture did not appear on the single cover.[18] However this misconception was cleared later when Madonna convinced Sire executives to allow her to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget music video directed by Ed Steinberg portrayed Madonna and her friends singing and dancing in a club to the song. The video helped to promote the song and Madonna as an artist further.[34] \\"Everybody\\" failed to enter the official Billboard Hot 100 chart and only charted at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles on December 25, 1982.[35] Nevertheless, the single was a hit on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play Chart, peaking at number three.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Burning Up\\" was released as the second single in the US on March 9, 1983, and later issued in some countries as a double A-side single with \\"Physical Attraction\\". The single peaked at number three on the dance chart in the US,[37] and became Madonna's first top twenty hit in Australia.[38] The accompanying music video of the song portrays Madonna writhing passionately on an empty road before her \\"lover\\" approaches in a car from behind. The video ends with Madonna driving the car instead, suggesting that she is ultimately in control.[39] \\"Holiday\\" was released as the third single on September 7, 1983 and became Madonna's first top-ten hit in many countries, including Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. It also became her first entry ever on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 16, and her first number-one hit on the dance chart.[37][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally released in the UK in September 1983, \\"Lucky Star\\" was the fourth single from the album. The single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100.[42] The music video portrayed Madonna dancing in front of a white background, accompanied by her dancers. After the video was released, Madonna's style and mannerisms became a fashion trend among the younger generation. Scholars noted that in the video, Madonna portrayed herself as narcissistic and an ambiguous character. She referred to herself as the \\"lucky star\\", unlike the lyrical meaning of the song.[43] \\"Borderline\\" was the fifth single from the album, and was released on February 15, 1984. In the US the song was released before \\"Lucky Star\\" and became Madonna's first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at ten. Elsewhere, the song reached the top twenty of a number of European nations while peaking the chart in Ireland.[44] The accompanying music video portrayed Madonna, with a Latin man as boyfriend. She was enticed by a British photographer to pose and model for him, but later returned to her original boyfriend. The video generated interest amongst academics, who noted the use of power as symbolism in it.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nA video compilation, titled Madonna, was released by Warner Music Video and Sire Records in November 1984 to promote the album. The singer's first video compilation, it contained three music videos from the album\\"Burning Up\\", \\"Borderline\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\"as well as the then current single \\"Like a Virgin\\".[45] The music video for \\"Lucky Star\\" was a special extended dance mix, and when she says \\"ooh yeah\\" it is echoed three times and her image is repeated three times. \\"Like a Virgin\\" omits the scene where the lion's tongue moves in time with the beat of the music. These videos were later released on the 1990 greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection with these edits changed.[45] The video was promoted at the Cabaret Metro club in Chicago, on February 9, 1985. Dubbed as 'The Virgin Party', the event drew a crowd of around 1,200 and promoted Madonna's LPs, cassettes, CDs and the videocassette. Attendees were encouraged to wear white, and for $5 admission fees, were able to view the Madonna videocassette and the premiere of the music video of her then upcoming single \\"Material Girl\\". The event was organised as a drive to promote music videos, which at that point did not have a large market.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna topped the Music Videocassette chart of Billboard for the period from April 13, 1985 to November 9, 1985. Jim McCullaugh from Billboard attributed the strong sales of the video to Madonna's recent studio album Like a Virgin and The Virgin Tour concert.[47] It placed at number one on the year-end music videocasette chart for 1985.[48] Madonna was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 100,000 units of the video.[49] It won the award for the \\"Best Selling Video Cassette Merchandised as Music Video\\" from the National Association of Recording Merchandisers.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote the album as \\"cleverly incorporated great pop songs with stylish, state-of-the-art beats, and it shrewdly walked a line between being a rush of sound and a showcase for a dynamic lead singer. This is music where all of the elements may not particularly impressive on their own  the arrangement, synth, and drum programming are fairly rudimentary  but taken together, it's utterly irresistible.\\"[51] Tony Power from Blender said that the album consisted of \\"quacking synths, overperky bass and state-of-the-art mechanical disco, with Madonna strapped to the wing rather than holding the controls. It's a breathless, subtlety-free debut, with overtones of Soft Cell and Tom Tom Club.\\"[52] While reviewing the remastered version of the album, released in 2001, Michael Paoletta from Billboard felt that \\"Nearly 20 years after the release of Madonna, such tracks as 'Holiday', 'Physical Attraction', 'Borderline' and 'Lucky Star' remain irresistible.\\"[25]\\r\\n[60] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A, saying \\"[Madonna] might have wound up just another post-disco dolly if [the songs on the album] didn't announce her ability to fuse club beats with peerless pop.\\"[55] In July 2008, the magazine ranked the album at number five in their list of \\"Top 100 Best Albums of Past 25 Years\\".[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Lamb from About.com commented: \\"[The] album is state of the art dance-pop loaded with hits from 'Holiday' and 'Lucky Star' to 'Borderline'. Irresistible pop hooks glide across shimmering synth beats to make this a landmark album of the early 80's.\\"[62] Jonathan Ross from Q said that \\"'Borderline' is sweet and 'Holiday' still fizzes with invention and joie de vivre....this quintessentially '80s dance hit also features a barrelhouse piano solo.\\"[57] Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice, \\"In case you bought the con, disco never died  just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy  essence of electro, the D in DOR.\\"[63] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone was of the opinion that \\"without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance.\\"[64] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine rated the album four and a half out of five stars and commented: \\"Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [Madonna] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago.\\"[19] In March 2012, the publication placed the album at number 33 on their \\"Best Albums of the 1980s\\" list.[65] Michaelangelo Matos from Spin selected the album among \\"The Definitive Guide to Classic Disco\\" and noted that it \\"mashed-up street sounds and reinvigorated disco for a generation that wanted nothing to do with polyester suits, ending an era and birthing a new one.\\"[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the album entered the Billboard 200 albums chart at number?190, the week of September 3, 1983.[37] The album had a slow and steady climb, and peaked at eight on the Billboard 200 on the week ending October 20, 1984, more than a year after its release.[67] It also peaked at twenty on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.[68] Within a year, Madonna had sold 2.8?million copies in the United States.[69] It placed at number twenty-seven on the year-end chart for 1984 and at number?25 on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year 1985.[70][71] After 17 years since its release, the album was certified five-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies across United States.[72] With the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 450,000 copies as of August 2010.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, the album was released on March 10, 1984, and debuted at number 87 on the RPM Albums Chart.[74] After few weeks it re-entered the chart again, at number 95 on August 4, 1984.[75] The album finally reached its peak position of number 16 in its 29th week.[76] It was present on the chart for a total of 47 weeks, and ranked at number 50 on the RPM Top 100 Albums of 1984 list.[77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the album was released on February 11, 1984, and charted on the UK Albums Chart, reaching a peak of thirty-seven and present on the chart for twenty weeks. After a re-release titled Madonna?ÿ The First Album in July 1985, the album charted again on the UK Albums chart. It ultimately reached a peak of number six and was present on the chart for 125 weeks.[79] Six months since the re-release, the album was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 300,000 copies of the album.[80] In Australia, the album reached a peak of ten on the Kent Music Report albums chart and was certified triple platinum.[38] The album reached the top ten of the charts in Netherlands, France and New Zealand; in the last two markets, it was certified Platinum.[81][82][83] It was also certified Platinum in Hong Kong and Gold in Germany and Spain.[84][85][86] Worldwide the album has sold more than 10 million copies.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Thomas Erlewine said that with the album, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of.[51] In the beginning of the 80s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to him, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna \\"launched dance-pop\\" and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades.[51] The staff of Vice magazine stated that the album \\"drew the blueprint for future dance-pop.\\"[88] Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 50 on \\"The 100 Best Albums of the Eighties\\" list, writing that \\"[the album's] assured style and sound, as well as Madonna's savvy approach to videos, helped the singer make the leap from dance diva to pop phenom, and it pointed the direction for a host of female vocalists from Janet Jackson to Debbie Gibson.\\"[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to biographer Andrew Morton, the album made Madonna a household name, and was instrumental in introducing her star power.[90] Martin Charles Strong, author of The Great Rock Discography felt that the album's unprecedented dance-pop and naive appeal served Madonna in establishing her base as an artist.[91] Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly commented: \\"Madonna's sound, and of course her look, would be heavily copied for years to come, but Madonna heralded something much bigger: the arrival of the pop diva as a singular force who put personality above all else.\\"[92] According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernndez, the songs on Madonna reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished arrangement and Madonna's own vocal style. In songs such as \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Burning Up\\", Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic critics Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart, commented in their book The 1980s that \\"the music videos for the singles off the album, was more effective in introducing Madonna to the rest of the world.\\"[94] Author Carol Clerk said that the music videos of \\"Burning Up\\", \\"Borderline\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" established Madonna, not as the girl-next-door, but as a sassy and smart, tough funny woman. Her clothes worn in the videos were later used by designers like Karl Lagerfeld and Christian Lacroix, in Paris Fashion week of the same year.[26] Professor Douglas Kellner, in his book Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern, commented that the videos depicted motifs and strategies which helped Madonna in her journey to become a star.[95] With the \\"Borderline\\" music video, Madonna was credited for breaking the taboo of interracial relationships, and it was considered one of her career-making moments. MTV played the video in heavy rotation, increasing Madonna's popularity further.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the release of the album, Madonna was dismissed by some critics. They called her voice sounding as \\"Minnie Mouse on helium\\", while the other detractors suggested that she was \\"almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers.\\"[96] Madonna said: \\"From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'.\\"[97] She responded to the comment \\"Minnie Mouse on helium\\" by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that \\"such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again.\\"[98] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, \\"The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance.\\"[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdapted from the album's liner notes.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"What is the name of madonna's first album?"},{"output":">12.5 years","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maine Coon is one of the largest domesticated breeds of cat. It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America, specifically native to the state of Maine,[3] where it is the official state cat.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo records of the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of introduction to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and is now one of the more popular cat breeds in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maine Coon is a large and sociable cat, hence its nickname, \\"the gentle giant.\\" It is characterized by a prominent ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an uneven two layered coat with longer guard hairs with a silky satin under layer undercoat, and a long, bushy tail.  The breed's colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree.  Reputed for its intelligence and playful, gentle personality, the Maine Coon is often cited as having \\"dog-like\\" characteristics.[4][5] Professionals notice certain health problems in the breed including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize the frequency of these problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestral origins of the Maine Coon are unknown[6]  there are only speculation and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother folk tale involves Captain Charles Coon, an English seafarer who kept long-haired cats aboard his ships. Whenever Coon's ship would anchor in New England ports, the felines would exit the ship and mate with the local feral cat population. When long-haired kittens began appearing in the litters of the local cat population, they were referred to as one of \\"Coon's cats\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA myth which is trait-based, though genetically impossible,[9] is the idea that the modern Maine Coon descended from ancestors of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail.[10] Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe generally accepted hypothesis among breeders is that the Maine Coon is descended from the pairings of local short-haired domestic cats and long-haired breeds brought overseas by English seafarers (possibly by Captain Charles Coon) or 11th-century Norsemen.[10][11] The connection to the Norsemen is seen in the strong resemblance of the Maine Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat, another breed that is said to be a descendant of cats that traveled with the Norsemen.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first mention of Maine Coons in a literary work was in 1861, in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903). F.R. Pierce, who owned several Maine Coons, wrote a chapter about the breed.[14] During the late 1860s, farmers located in Maine told stories about their cats and held the \\"Maine State Champion Coon Cat\\" contest at the local Skowhegan Fair.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1895, a dozen Maine Coons were entered into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show.[15] The silver collar was purchased by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation with the help of a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, the Maine Coon's popularity began to decline with the introduction of other long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the Middle East. The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland, Oregon. The breed was rarely seen after that. The decline was so severe that the breed was declared extinct in the 1950s, although this declaration was considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time. The Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) was created in the early 1950s by Ethylin Whittemore, Alta Smith and Ruby Dyer in attempts to increase the popularity of the Maine Coon. For 11 years, the CMCC held cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is noted for creating the first written breed standards for the Maine Coon.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maine Coon was denied provisional breed statusone of the three steps required for a breed not yet recognized by the CFA to be able to compete in championship competitions[16]by the CFA three times, which led to the formation of the Maine Coon Cat Club in 1973. The breed was finally accepted by the CFA under provisional status on 1 May 1975, and was approved for championship status on 1 May 1976. The next couple of decades saw a rise in popularity of the Maine Coon, with championship victories and an increase in national rankings. In 1985, the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the official State Cat.[17] Today the Maine Coon is the third most popular cat breed, according to the number of kittens registered with the CFA.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maine Coon is the largest breed of domestic cat. On average, males weigh from 13 to 18?lb (5.9 to 8.2?kg) with females weighing from 8 to 12?lb (3.6 to 5.4?kg).[19] The height of adults can vary between 10 and 16?in (25 and 41?cm) and they can reach a length of up to 48?in (120?cm), including the tail, which can reach a length of 14?in (36?cm)[20] and is long, tapering, and heavily furred, almost resembling a raccoon's tail. The body is solid and muscular, which is necessary for supporting their own weight, and the chest is broad. Maine Coons possess a rectangular body shape and are slow to physically mature; their full potential size is normally not reached until they are three to five years old, while other cats take about one year.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the Guinness World Records accepted a male purebred Maine Coon named \\"Stewie\\" as the \\"Longest Cat\\" measuring 48.5?in (123?cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. Stewie died 4 February 2013, from cancer at his home in Reno, Nevada, at age 8.[22][23] As of 2015 the living record-holder for \\"Longest Cat\\" is \\"Ludo\\", measuring 3?ft 10.59 in (118.33?cm). He lives in Wakefield, UK.[24] Large Maine Coons can overlap in length with Eurasian lynxes, although with a much lighter build and lower height.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maine Coon is a long or medium haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, although texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter on the head and shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation,[26] with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine Coons can have any colors that other cats have. Colors indicating crossbreeding, such as chocolate, lavender, the Siamese pointed patterns or the \\"ticked\\" patterns, are not accepted by some breed standards (the 'ticked' pattern, for example, is accepted by TICA).[8] The most common pattern seen in the breed is brown tabby.[27] All eye colors are accepted under breed standards, with the exception of the occurrence of blue-colored or odd-eyes (i.e. two eyes of different colors) in cats possessing coat colors other than white.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine Coons have several physical adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection when they are walking or sitting on top of wet surfaces of snow or ice.[28] Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface.[29] Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons,[30] facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes.[28] Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight.[29] Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the original Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet).[28] While some sources claim that trait is thought to have occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim.[31] Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards.[32] The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene,[33] which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health.[34] The trait was almost eradicated from the breed due to the fact that it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings.[35] Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine Coons are known as the \\"gentle giants\\"[5] and possess above-average intelligence, making them relatively easy to train.[4] They are known for being loyal to their family and cautiousbut not meanaround strangers, but are independent and not clingy. The Maine Coon is generally not known for being a \\"lap cat\\" but their gentle disposition makes the breed relaxed around dogs, other cats, and children. They are playful throughout their lives, with males tending to be more clownish and females generally possessing more dignity, yet both are equally affectionate.[28] Many Maine Coons have a fascination with water and some theorize that this personality trait comes from their ancestors, who were aboard ships for much of their lives.[6] Maine Coons are also well known for being very vocal cats. They are known for their frequent yowling or howling, trilling, chirping, and making other loud vocalizations.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nA sitting Maine Coon\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale Maine Coon brown tabby, age?6.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Maine Coon kitten at three days old\\r\\n\\r\\nCream shaded Maine Coon\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine Coon silver tabby\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine Coon kitten at 75 days old\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Silver Tabby 7 months old male Maine Coon\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine Coons require ample protein and nutrients in their diets. Since they are a large cat breed with high levels of energy, it is best to feed them quality food. Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nPet insurance data obtained from a study during years 2003ÿ2006 in Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at >12.5 years. 74% lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more.[38] Maine Coons are generally a healthy and hardy breed and have adapted to survive the New England climate. The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease seen in cats, whether pure bred or not. In Maine Coons, it is thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Middle-aged to older cats as well as males are thought to be predisposed to the disease.[39] HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure, paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolization originating in the heart, and sudden death.[40] A specific mutation that causes HCM is seen in Maine Coons for which testing services are offered.[41] Of all the Maine Coons tested for the MyBPC mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine located at Washington State University, approximately one-third tested positive.[42]  Not all cats that tested positive will have clinical signs of the disease and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed. The HCM prevalence was found to be 10.1% (95% CI 5.8 -14.3% ) in this study.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother potential health problem is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes the loss of the spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3ÿ4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nHip dysplasia is an abnormality of the hip joint which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced.[45] X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a slowly progressive disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed with a low incidence in Maine Coons, PKD appears to be a misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study[47] spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6?mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.","input":"What is the average lifespan of a maine coon?"},{"output":"To the Shores of Tripoli","context":"Semper fidelis is a Latin phrase that means \\"always faithful\\" or \\"always loyal\\". It is the motto of the United States Marine Corps usually shortened to Semper fi. It is also in use as a motto for towns, families, schools, and military units.\\r\\nThe earliest definitively recorded use of semper fidelis is as the motto of the French town of Abbeville since 1369. It has also been used by other towns, and is recorded as the motto of various European families since the 16th century, and possibly since the 13th century or earlier. Records show many families in England, France and Ireland using this motto.\\r\\nThe earliest recorded use of semper fidelis by a military unit is by the Duke of Beaufort's Regiment of Foot, raised in south-western England in 1685. This is apparently linked to its use as a motto by the city of Exeter since no later than 1660. Subsequently, a variety of military organisations adopted the motto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis phrase was used in Europe, at least in Great Britain, Ireland and France and probably in other countries as well. A more recent adoption is by Senator Joe Doyle, in arms granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1999.\\r\\nBernard Burke in 1884[1] listed many notable families in Great Britain and Ireland using the motto \\"Semper fidelis\\" in their coats of arms. They include:\\r\\nBurke's full list of families using the motto was: Booker, Barbeson, Bonner, Broadmead, Carney, Chesterman, Dick, Dickins, Duffield, Edge, Formby, Frisby, Garrett, Haslett, Hill, Houlton, Kearney, Lynch, Lund, Marriott, Nicholls, Onslow, Pollexfen, Smith, Steele, Steehler, Steuart, Stirling and Wilcoxon. A large portion of these families were Irish or Scottish.\\r\\nChassant and Tausin (1878, p.?647)[7] list the following French families as using it: D'Arbaud of Jonques, De Bronis, Chevalier of Pontis, Du Golinot of Mauny, De Coynart, De Genibrouse of Gastelpers, Macar of the Province of Liege, Milet of Mureau, Navoir of Ponzac, De Piomelles, De Poussois, De Reymons, and De Rozerou of Mos.\\r\\nThe city of Abbeville in France is recorded by 19th century sources (such as Chassant and Taussin, 1878) as using the motto \\"Semper fidelis,\\" and recent sources[8] state that the city was accorded this motto by Charles V, by letters patent of 19 June 1369, issued at Vincennes. This would make it the earliest recorded user of the motto among cities. However both Louandre (1834, p.?169)[9] and the city's current official website[10] give the motto simply as \\"Fidelis\\", and Sanson (1646, p.?15)[11] claimed that even this was not part of Charles's original grant, but was added later, sometime in the 14th to 17th centuries.\\r\\nIn 1658, Pope Alexander VII declared the city to be Semper fidelis, in recognition of the its key role in defending Europe and Roman Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\\r\\nToday, in Poland, the motto is referenced mainly in connection with the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1919 following the collapse of Austro-Hungary in the wake of World War I, and more especially in connection with the Polish-Bolshevik War that followed.\\r\\nIn Ukraine, the phrase is used much less, and refers to the survival of the Ukrainian Church through the period of Soviet persecution.\\r\\nThe City of Exeter, in Devon, England, has used the motto since at least 1660, when it appears in a manuscript of the local chronicler, Richard Izacke. Izacke claimed that the motto was adopted in 1588 to signify the city's loyalty to the English Crown. According to Izacke, it was Queen Elizabeth I who suggested that the city adopt this motto (perhaps in imitation of her own motto, Semper eadem, \\"Ever the same\\"); her suggestion is said to have come in a letter to \\"the Citizens of Exeter,\\" in recognition of their gift of money toward the fleet that had defeated the Spanish Armada. John Hooker's map of Exeter of around 1586 shows the city's coat of arms without the motto, suggesting that the city's use of the motto is no older than this. However the city archives do not hold any letter relating to the motto, and Grey (2005) argues that the Elizabethan origin of the motto may be no more than a local myth, since it is not recorded in contemporary chronicles, and that it may have been adopted at the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy to compensate for the city's less than total loyalty to the crown during the English Civil War.\\r\\nVarious bodies associated with the city of Exeter also use the motto:\\r\\n\\"Semper fidelis\\" is the motto of the town of St. Malo, in Brittany, France. The date of its adoption is not known, but it appears to have been in use in the 17th century,[13] replacing an earlier motto, \\"Cave canem\\".\\r\\n\\"Civitas Calvi Semper Fidelis\\" may have been the motto of the city of Calvi, Balagna area in Corsica for 500 years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\"Semper Fidelis\\" is the motto of the city of White Plains, in New York, United States.\\r\\nThe south-western English town of Exeter has used the motto semper fidelis since no later than 1660, inspiring its use by several south-western English military units.\\r\\nIn 1685 the motto was used by Duke of Beaufort when The Duke of Beaufort's Regiment of Foot, or Beaufort Musketeers, were raised to defend Bristol against the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion. It was numbered as the 11th Regiment of Foot when the numerical system of regimental designation was adopted in 1751 and was designated the regiment for North Devonshire.\\r\\nThe 1st (Exeter and South Devon) Rifle Volunteer Corps, raised in Exeter in 1852, was using the motto on its cap badge by 1860 at the latest; the Illustrated London News reported its use in its 7 January 1860 issue.[14] The motto was continued by The Devonshire Regiment of the British Army.\\r\\nThe motto was further continued on the badges of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment when the Devonshires were amalgamated into them in 1958. This use of the motto evidently derives from these regiments' close connection with the city of Exeter, where they had a base from their foundation (see the Illustrated London News article referenced above) until their disappearance by amalgamation into the Rifles in 2007.\\r\\nThe Irish units in France used a similar motto, \\"Semper et ubique Fidelis\\", meaning \\"Always and Everywhere Faithful\\". These units, forming the Irish Brigade, were raised in 1690-1 under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick, which ended the war between King James II and King William III in Ireland and Britain. As the native Irish army in exile, \\"Semper et ubique Fidelis\\" was a reference to their fidelity to the Catholic faith, King James II, and to the king of France. For decades the Irish Brigade served as an independent army within the French army, remaining \\"Always and Everywhere Faithful\\" to their native Irish traditions (such as having the men elect their own officers, unheard of in France and England).\\r\\nWalsh's regiment of the Irish Brigade is noted for aiding the American cause in the American Revolution, when they were assigned as marines to John Paul Jones's ship, the Bonhomme Richard.[15]\\r\\nThe involvement of Irish Brigade soldiers serving as marines in the American War of Independence may have inspired the adoption of the motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" by the US Marines. This would be ironic since the Irish Brigade motto referred specifically to their loyalty to Catholicism and Catholic kings, while the American rebels were fighting for a republican form of government for a largely Protestant population.\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Semper Fidelis\\" was made the official motto of the Marine Corps by Charles Grymes McCawley, the eighth Commandant of the Marine Corps, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which had a large Irish Catholic population. McCawley owed his commission[16] to Senator Pierre Soule of Louisiana a Catholic, born and raised in France, who would have been well aware of the Irish Brigade's service as Marines during the American Revolution.[17]\\r\\n\\"Semper fidelis\\" is the motto of the cadets corps of the Dutch Royal Military Academy.[18] The corps was founded on 24 November 1828.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Semper fidelis\\" is also the motto of the 11th Infantry Regiment, which was founded in May 1861 by President Abraham Lincoln.

It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at $100 million in 1962,[2] which is worth nearly $800 million in 2017.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe painting is thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that it would not have been started before 1513.[4][5][6][7] It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic,[9] the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, comes from a description by Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, who wrote \\"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\\"[11][12] Mona in Italian is a polite form of address originating as \\"ma donna\\" ÿ similar to \\"Maam\\", \\"Madam\\", or \\"my lady\\" in English. This became \\"madonna\\", and its contraction \\"mona\\". The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled \\"Mona\\" (as used by Vasari[11]), is also commonly spelled in modern Italian as Monna Lisa (\\"mona\\" being a vulgarity in some Italian dialects) but this is rare in English.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nVasari's account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo's assistant Sala, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume written by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \\"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo. About this we are now certain. Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe model, Lisa del Giocondo,[15][16]\\r\\nwas a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo.[17] The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea.[18] The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means \\"jocund\\" (\\"happy\\" or \\"jovial\\") or, literally, \\"the jocund one\\", a pun on the feminine form of Lisa's married name, \\"Giocondo\\".[17][19] In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore that discovery, scholars had developed several alternative views as to the subject of the painting. Some argued that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, identifying at least four other paintings as the Mona Lisa referred to by Vasari.[20][21]\\r\\nSeveral other women have been proposed as the subject of the painting.[22]\\r\\nIsabella of Aragon,[23] Cecilia Gallerani,[24] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[22] Isabella d'Este, Pacifica Brandano or Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforzaeven Sala and Leonardo himselfare all among the list of posited models portrayed in the painting.[25][26]\\r\\nThe consensus of art historians in the 21st century maintains the long-held traditional opinion, that the painting depicts Lisa del Giocondo.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonardo da Vinci is thought by some to have begun painting the Mona Lisa in 1503 or 1504 in Florence, Italy.[27] Although the Louvre states that it was \\"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\\",[10] the art historian Martin Kemp says there are some difficulties in confirming the actual dates with certainty.[17] In addition, many Leonardo experts, such as Carlo Pedretti [4] and Alessandro Vezzosi,[5] are of the opinion that the painting is characteristic of Leonardos style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.[7] According to Leonardo's contemporary, Giorgio Vasari, \\"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\\".[12] Leonardo, later in his life, is said to have regretted \\"never having completed a single work\\".[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nCirca 1504, Raphael executed a pen and ink sketch, today in the Louvre museum, in which the subject is flanked by large columns,. Experts universally agree it is based on Leonardos portrait of Mona Lisa.[29][30][6][31] Other later copies of the Mona Lisa, such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo and The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was originally thought that the Mona Lisa in the Louvre had side columns and had been cut.[32][33][4][34][35] However, as early as 1993, Z?llner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed.[36] This was confirmed through a series of tests conducted in 2004.[37] In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre museum states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version,[38] while Frank Z?llner states that the sketch brings up the possibility that Leonardo executed another work on the subject of Mona Lisa.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unclear as to who commissioned the painting. Vasari states that the work was painted for Francesco del Giocondo, the husband of Lisa del Giocondo.[39] However, Antonio de Beatis, following a visit with Leonardo in 1517, records that the painting was executed at the instance of Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Fran?ois I to work at the Clos Luc near the king's castle in Amboise. It is believed that he took the Mona Lisa with him and continued to work after he moved to France.[25] Art historian Carmen C. Bambach has concluded that Leonardo probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fate of the painting around Leonardos death and just after it has divided academic opinion. Some, such as Kemp, believe that upon Leonardos death, the painting was inherited with other works by his pupil and assistant Sala and was still in the latters possession in 1525.[17][42] Others believe that the painting was sold to Francis I by Sala, together with The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and the St. John the Baptist in 1518.[43] The Louvre Museum lists the painting as having entered the Royal collection in 1518.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the issue surrounding the dating of the painting, the presence of the flanking columns in the Raphael sketch, the uncertainty concerning the person who commissioned it and its fate around the time of Leonardos death, a number of experts have argued that Leonardo painted two versions of the Mona Lisa.[31][6][45] The first would have been commissioned by Francesco del Giocondo circa 1503, had flanking columns, have been left unfinished and have been in Salais possession in 1525. The second, commissioned by Giuliano de Medici circa 1513, without the flanking columns, would have been sold by Salai to Francis I in 1518 and be the one in the Louvre today.[31][6][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe painting was kept at the Palace of Fontainebleau, where it remained until Louis XIV moved the painting to the Palace of Versailles. After the French Revolution, it was moved to the Louvre, but spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon in the Tuileries Palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War (1870ÿ71) it was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal.[46] During World War II, Mona Lisa was again removed from the Louvre and taken safely, first to Chateau d'Amboise, then to the Loc-Dieu Abbey and Chateau de Chambord, then finally to the Ingres Museum in Montauban.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2015, it was reported that French scientist Pascal Cotte had found a hidden portrait underneath the surface of the painting using reflective light technology.[47] The portrait is an underlying image of a model looking off to the side.[48] Having been given access to the painting by Louvre in 2004, Cotte spent ten years using layer amplification methods to study the painting.[47] According to Cotte, the underlying image is Leonardo's original Mona Lisa.[47][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this portrait does not fit with the description of the painting in the historical records: Both Vasari[11] and Gian Paolo Lomazzo[50] describe the subject as smiling; the subject in Cottes portrait displays no smile. In addition, the portrait lacks the flanking columns drawn by Raphael in his c.1504 sketch of Mona Lisa. Moreover, Cotte admits that his reconstitution had been carried out only in support of his hypotheses and should not be considered a real painting; he stresses that the images never existed.[51] Kemp is also adamant that Cottes images in no way establish the existence of a separate underlying portrait.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 August 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre.[52] The theft was not discovered until the next day, when painter Louis Broud walked into the museum and went to the Salon Carr where the Mona Lisa had been on display for five years, only to find four iron pegs on the wall. Broud contacted the head of the guards, who thought the painting was being photographed for promotional purposes. A few hours later, Broud checked back with the Section Chief of the Louvre who confirmed that the Mona Lisa was not with the photographers. The Louvre was closed for an entire week during the investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench poet Guillaume Apollinaire came under suspicion and was arrested and imprisoned. Apollinaire implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was brought in for questioning. Both were later exonerated.[53][54] Two years later the thief revealed himself. Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia had stolen the Mona Lisa by entering the building during regular hours, hiding in a broom closet, and walking out with it hidden under his coat after the museum had closed.[19] Peruggia was an Italian patriot who believed Leonardo's painting should have been returned for display in an Italian museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeruggia may have been motivated by an associate whose copies of the original would significantly rise in value after the painting's theft. A later account suggested Eduardo de Valfierno had been the mastermind of the theft and had commissioned forger Yves Chaudron to create six copies of the painting to sell in the U.S. while the location of the original was unclear.[55] However, the original painting remained in Europe. After having kept the Mona Lisa in his apartment for two years, Peruggia grew impatient and was caught when he attempted to sell it to directors of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It was exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery for over two weeks and returned to the Louvre on 4 January 1914.[56] Peruggia served six months in prison for the crime and was hailed for his patriotism in Italy.[54] Before its theft, the Mona Lisa was not widely known outside the art world. It was not until the 1860s that some critics, a thin slice of the French intelligentsia, began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1956, part of the painting was damaged when a vandal threw acid at it.[58] On 30 December of that year, a rock was thrown at the painting, dislodging a speck of pigment near the left elbow, later restored.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of bulletproof glass has shielded the Mona Lisa from subsequent attacks. In April 1974, while the painting was on display at the Tokyo National Museum, a woman sprayed it with red paint as a protest against that museum's failure to provide access for disabled people.[60] On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a ceramic teacup purchased at the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure.[61][62] In both cases, the painting was undamaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere.[63] Z?llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \\"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\\"[64] Woods-Marsden cites  Hans Memling's portrait of Benededetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman sits markedly upright in a \\"pozzetto\\" armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer.  The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato). The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood \\"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\\".[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe painting was one of the first portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape, and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.[68] The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side. Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains. Winding paths and a distant bridge give only the slightest indications of human presence. Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nMona Lisa has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes. Some researchers claim that it was common at this time for genteel women to pluck these hairs, as they were considered unsightly.[69][70] In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.[71] Cotte discovered the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the Mona Lisa's face and the direction of her gaze. He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape. For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \\"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\\"[73] Some art historians in Eastern art, such as Yukio Yashiro, argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by Chinese paintings,[74] but this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University said that Mona Lisa's smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as foveal. Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly; however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed likenesses of Mona Lisa's landscapes to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro, Urbino and Rimini.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mona Lisa has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that \\"the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation.\\"[37] This is partly due to a variety of conservation treatments the painting has undergone. A detailed analysis in 1933 by Madame de Gironde revealed that earlier restorers had \\"acted with a great deal of restraint.\\"[37] Nevertheless, applications of varnish made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure. Despite the treatments, the Mona Lisa has been well cared for throughout its history, and although the panel's warping caused the curators \\"some worry\\",[78] the 2004ÿ05 conservation team was optimistic about the future of the work.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point, the Mona Lisa was removed from its original frame. The unconstrained poplar panel warped freely with changes in humidity, and as a result, a crack developed near the top of the panel, extending down to the hairline of the figure. In the mid-18th century to early 19th century, two butterfly-shaped walnut braces were inserted into the back of the panel to a depth of about one third the thickness of the panel. This intervention was skilfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture's theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture is kept under strict, climate-controlled conditions in its bulletproof glass case. The humidity is maintained at 50%?I10%, and the temperature is maintained between 18 and 21?C. To compensate for fluctuations in relative humidity, the case is supplemented with a bed of silica gel treated to provide 55% relative humidity.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the Mona Lisa's poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used in addition to the decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after it was found that the beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004ÿ05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mona Lisa has had many different decorative frames in its history, owing to changes in taste over the centuries. In 1909, the Comtesse de Bhague gave the portrait its current frame,[79] a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of the Mona Lisa. The edges of the painting have been trimmed at least once in its history to fit the picture into various frames, but no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first and most extensive recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, who was responsible for restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Muse Napolon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugne Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to Mona Lisa's left elbow with watercolour.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, a new insect infestation was discovered in the back of the panel as a result of crosspieces installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with carbon tetrachloride, and later with an ethylene oxide treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with carbon tetrachloride as a preventive measure.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 April 2005following a period of curatorial maintenance, recording, and analysisthe painting was moved to a new location within the museum's Salle des tats. It is displayed in a purpose-built, climate-controlled enclosure behind bulletproof glass.[80] Since 2005 the painting has been illuminated by an LED lamp, and in 2013 a new 20 watt LED lamp was installed, specially designed for this painting. The lamp has a colour rendering index up to 98, and minimizes infrared and ultraviolet radiation which could otherwise degrade the painting.[81] The renovation of the gallery where the painting now resides was financed by the Japanese broadcaster Nippon Television.[82] About 6?million people view the painting at the Louvre each year.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday the Mona Lisa is considered the most famous painting in the world, but until the 20th century it was simply one among many highly regarded artworks.[83]\\r\\nOnce part of King Francis I of France's collection, the Mona Lisa was among the first artworks to be exhibited in Louvre, which became a national museum after the French Revolution. From the 19th century Leonardo began to be revered as a genius and the painting's popularity grew from the mid-19th century when French intelligentsia developed a theme that it was mysterious and a representation of the femme fatale.[84]\\r\\nThe Baedeker guide in 1878 called it \\"the most celebrated work of Leonardo in the Louvre\\",[85] but the painting was known more by the intelligentsia than the general public.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa and its subsequent return was reported worldwide, leading to a massive increase in public recognition of the painting. During the 20th century it was an object for mass reproduction, merchandising, lampooning and speculation, and was claimed to have been reproduced in \\"300 paintings and 2,000 advertisements\\".[85] It has been said that the Mona Lisa was regarded as \\"just another Leonardo until early last century, when the scandal of the painting's theft from the Louvre and subsequent return kept a spotlight on it over several years.\\"[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom December 1962 to March 1963, the French government lent it to the United States to be displayed in New York City and Washington, D.C.[87][88] It was shipped on the new liner SS France.[89] In New York an estimated 1.7 million people queued \\"in order to cast a glance at the Mona Lisa for 20 seconds or so.\\"[85] While exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the painting was almost drenched in water because of a faulty sprinkler, but the bullet-proof glass case which encased the painting protected it.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, the painting was exhibited in Tokyo and Moscow.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, 9.3 million people visited the Louvre.[92] Former director Henri Loyrette reckoned that \\"80?percent of the people only want to see the Mona Lisa.\\"[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1962ÿ63 tour, the painting was assessed for insurance at $100?million. The insurance was not bought. Instead, more was spent on security.[94] Adjusted for inflation using the US Consumer Price Index, $100?million in 1962 is around $782 million in 2015[95] making it, in practice, by far the most valued painting in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014 a France 24 article suggested that the painting could be sold to help ease the national debt, although it was noted that the Mona Lisa and other such art works were prohibited from being sold due to French heritage law, which states that \\"Collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and cannot be otherwise.\\"[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore its completion the Mona Lisa had already begun to influence contemporary Florentine painting.  Raphael, who had been to Leonardo's workshop several times, promptly used elements of the portrait's composition and format in several of his works, such as Young Woman with Unicorn (c.?1506[97]), and Portrait of Maddalena Doni (c.?1506).  Celebrated later paintings by Raphael, La velata (1515ÿ16) and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione (c.?1514ÿ15), continued to borrow from Leonardo's painting. Zollner states that \\"None of Leonardo's works would exert more influence upon the evolution of the genre than the Mona Lisa.  It became the definitive example of the Renaissance portrait and perhaps for this reason is seen not just as the likeness of a real person, but also as the embodiment of an ideal.\\"[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly commentators such as Vasari and Andr Flibien praised the picture for its realism, but by the Victorian era writers began to regard the Mona Lisa as imbued with a sense of mystery and romance.  In 1859 Thophile Gautier wrote that the Mona Lisa was a \\"sphinx of beauty who smiles so mysteriously\\" and that \\"Beneath the form expressed one feels a thought that is vague, infinite, inexpressible. One is moved, troubled ... repressed desires, hopes that drive one to despair, stir painfully.\\"  Walter Pater's famous essay of 1869 described the sitter as \\"older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her.\\"[99]  By the early 20th?century some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories,[100] and upon the painting's theft in 1911, Renaissance historian Bernard Berenson admitted that it had \\"simply become an incubus, and I was glad to be rid of her.\\"[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe avant-garde art world has made note of the undeniable fact of the Mona Lisa's popularity. Because of the painting's overwhelming stature, Dadaists and Surrealists often produce modifications and caricatures. Already in 1883, Le rire, an image of a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, by Sapeck (Eugne Bataille), was shown at the \\"Incoherents\\" show in Paris. In 1919, Marcel Duchamp, one of the most influential modern artists, created L.H.O.O.Q., a Mona Lisa parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and goatee. Duchamp added an inscription, which when read out loud in French sounds like \\"Elle a chaud au cul\\" meaning: \\"she has a hot ass\\", implying the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and intended as a Freudian joke.[102] According to Rhonda R. Shearer, the apparent reproduction is in fact a copy partly modelled on Duchamp's own face.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalvador Dal, famous for his surrealist work, painted Self portrait as Mona Lisa in 1954.[104] In 1963 following the painting's visit to the United States, Andy Warhol created serigraph prints of multiple Mona Lisas called Thirty are Better than One, like his works of Marilyn Monroe (Twenty-five Coloured Marilyns, 1962), Elvis Presley (1964) and Campbell's soup (1961ÿ62).[105] The Mona Lisa continues to inspire artists. A French urban artist known pseudonymously as Invader has created versions on city walls in Paris and Tokyo using a mosaic style.[106] A collection of Mona Lisa parodies may be found on YouTube.[107]  A 2014 New Yorker magazine cartoon parodies the supposed enigma of the Mona Lisa smile in an animation showing progressively maniacal smiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nA version of Mona Lisa known as Mujer de mano de Leonardo Abince (\\"Leonardo da Vinci's handy-woman\\") held in Madrid's Museo del Prado was for centuries considered to be a work by Leonardo. However, since its restoration in 2012 it is considered to have been executed by one of Leonardo's pupils in his studio at the same time as Mona Lisa was being painted.[108] Their conclusion, based on analysis obtained after the picture underwent extensive restoration, that the painting is probably by Sala (1480ÿ1524) or by Melzi (1493ÿ1572). This has been called into question by others.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe restored painting is from a slightly different perspective than the original Mona Lisa, leading to the speculation that it is part of the world's first stereoscopic pair.[110][111][112]  However, a more recent report has demonstrated that this stereoscopic pair in fact gives no reliable stereoscopic depth.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nA version of the Mona Lisa known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa and also known as the Earlier Mona Lisa was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by Hugh Blaker, an art connoisseur. The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation.[114]  It is a painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The painting is claimed by a majority of experts to be mostly an original work of Leonardo dating from the early 16th century.[115][29][116][117][118][119][120][31][121][6][7][45] Other experts, including Z?llner and Kemp, deny the attribution.[122][119]\\r\\n\\r\\nCopy of Mona Lisa commonly attributed to Sala\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prado Museum La Gioconda\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Isleworth Mona Lisa\\r\\n\\r\\n16th-century copy at the Hermitage by unknown artist\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nBibliography","input":"What style of painting is the mona lisa?"},{"output":"On average a new series has been released every four months","context":"Minifigures is a 2010 Lego theme based on a set of collectible Lego minifigures.

They are the most common kind of angioma. They are called Campbell de Morgan spots after the nineteenth-century British surgeon Campbell De Morgan, who first noted and described them.\\r\\nThe frequency of cherry angiomas increases with age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCherry angiomas are made up of clusters of capillaries at the surface of the skin, forming a small round dome (\\"papule\\")[citation needed], which may be flat topped[citation needed]. They range in colour from bright red to purple. When they first develop, they may be only a tenth of a millimeter in diameter and almost flat, appearing as small red dots. However, they then usually grow to about one or two millimeters across, and sometimes to a centimeter or more in diameter[citation needed]. As they grow larger, they tend to expand in thickness, and may take on the raised and rounded shape of a dome. Multiple adjoining angiomas are said to form a polypoid angioma. Because the blood vessels comprising an angioma are so close to the skin's surface, cherry angiomas may bleed profusely if they are injured.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne study found that the majority of capillaries in cherry hemangiomas are fenestrated because of staining for carbonic anhydrase activity.[3]\\r\\nCherry angiomas appear spontaneously in many people in middle age but can also, less commonly, occur in young people. They can also occur in an aggressive eruptive manner in any age. The underlying cause for the development of cherry angiomas is not understood.\\r\\nFindings suggest that cherry angioma may occur through two different mechanisms: angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels), and vasculogenesis (the formation of totally new vessels, which usually occurs during embryonic and fetal development).[4]\\r\\nThe first study trying to bring light to the molecular and genetic mechanisms behind cherry/senile hemangioma was published in 2010.[5] The study found that the level of microRNA 424 is significantly reduced in senile hemangiomas compared to normal skin resulting in increased protein expression of MEK1 and cyclin E1. By inhibiting mir-424 in normal endothelial cells they could observe the same increased protein expression of MEK1 and cyclin E1 which, important for the development of senile hemangioma, induced cell proliferation of the endothelial cells. They also found that targeting MEK1 and cyclin E1 with small interfering RNA decreased the number of endothelial cells.\\r\\nChemicals and compounds that have been seen to cause cherry angiomas are mustard gas,[6][7][8][9] 2-butoxyethanol,[10] bromides,[11] and cyclosporine.[12]\\r\\nA significant increase in the density of mast cells has been seen in cherry hemangiomas compared with normal skin.[13]\\r\\nThese lesions generally do not require treatment. If they are cosmetically unappealing or are subject to bleeding angiomas may be removed by electrocautery, a process of destroying the tissue by use of a small probe with an electric current running through it.[14] Removal may cause scarring. More recently pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment has also been used.[15][16]\\r\\nFuture treatment based on a locally acting inhibitor of MEK1 and Cyclin E1 could possibly be an option. A natural MEK1 inhibitor is myricetin[17][18]\\r\\nIn most patients, the number and size of cherry angiomas increases with advancing age. They are harmless, having no relation to cancer at all.[19]\\r\\nCherry angiomas occur in all races, ethnic backgrounds, and sexes.","input":"What causes red blood filled spots on skin?"},{"output":"to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought as the dominant ideology within the Party","context":"","input":"What was the objective of the cultural revolution?"},{"output":"cereals","context":"Agriculture in Scotland includes all land use for arable, horticultural, pastoral or hunting activity in Scotland, or around its coasts. The first permanent settlements and farming date from the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago. From the beginning of the Bronze Age, about 2000 BCE, arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, beginning in the seventh century BCE, there was use of cultivation ridges and terraces. During the period of Roman occupation there was a reduction in agriculture and the early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration resulting in more unproductive land. Most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet, supplemented by hunter-gathering. More oats and barley were grown than corn, and cattle were the most important domesticated animal. From c. 1150 to 1300, the Medieval Warm Period allowed cultivation at greater heights and made land more productive. The system of infield and outfield agriculture may have been introduced with feudalism from the twelfth century. The rural economy boomed in the thirteenth century, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century.\\r\\nThe early modern era saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, which peaked towards the end of the seventeenth century. The closing decade of the seventeenth century saw a slump, followed by four years of failed harvests, in what is known as the \\"seven ill years\\", but these shortages would be the last of their kind. After the Union of 1707 there was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Introductions included haymaking, the English plough, new crops, crop rotation and encloses were introduced. The resulting Lowland Clearances saw hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland forcibly removed. The later Highland Clearances saw the forced displacement much of the population of the Highland as lands were enclosed for sheep farming. Those that remained many were now crofters, living on very small rented farms.\\r\\nIn the twentieth century Scottish agriculture became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in World War II. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming. There was increasing mechanisation and farming became less labour-intensive. UK membership of the European Economic Community from 1972 began a change in orientation for Scottish farming. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.\\r\\nRoughly 79 per cent of Scotlands total land area is under agricultural production. Cereals accounted for 78 per cent of the land area, while livestock numbers have been falling in recent years. Around 15 per cent of the total land area of Scotland is forested, most in public ownership controlled by the Forestry Commission. Total income from farming has been rising since the turn of the millennium. Aquaculture production is focused on the West and North of the country. Some farm businesses rely on sources of income other than from farming. Scottish agriculture employs around 1.5 per cent of the workforce and contributes to around 1 per cent of the Scottish economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England runs.[1] The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width,[2] and contains most of the good quality agricultural land.[3] Scotland is half the size of England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly the same amount of coastline at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level.[4]\\r\\nScotland's soils are diverse for a relatively small country due to the variation in geology, topography, climate, altitude and land use history. There are very productive arable soils in the east of the country, including some of the most productive for wheat and barley of anywhere in the world. Scotland's soils differ from much of the rest of the UK and Europe and they provide valuable habitats for wildlife and flora. They are largely naturally acidic in nature with high concentrations of organic carbon. They are predominantly coarse textured and often exhibit poor drainage.[5]\\r\\nThe climate of Scotland is temperate and very changeable, but rarely extreme.[6] Scotland is warmed by the North Atlantic Drift and given the northerly location of the country, experiences much milder conditions than areas on similar latitudes. Average temperatures are lower than in the rest of Great Britain. Western coastal areas of Scotland are warmer than the east and inland areas, due to the influence of the Atlantic currents, and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea.[7] Rainfall totals vary widely across Scotlandthe western highlands of Scotland are one of the wettest places in the UK with annual rainfall up to 4,577?mm (180.2?in). In comparison, much of eastern Scotland receives less than 870?mm (34.3?in) annually; lying in the rain shadow of the western uplands.[8] Annual average sunshine totals vary from as little as 711ÿ1140 hours in the Highlands and the north-west up to 1471ÿ1540 hours on the extreme eastern and south-western coasts.[9] Wind prevails from the south-west, bringing warm, wet and unstable air from the Atlantic.[6] The windiest areas of Scotland are in the north and west, with parts of the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland experiencing over 30 days with gales per year.[6] Vigorous Atlantic depressions, also known as European windstorms, are a common feature of the autumn and winter in Scotland.[10]\\r\\nMesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments formed the first known settlements in Scotland around 8500 BCE.[12] These were highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers.[13] In the Neolithic period, around 6,000 years ago, there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming.[14] Archaeological evidence indicates that the two main sources of food were grain and cow's milk.[15] From the beginning of the Bronze Age, about 2000 BCE, arable land spread at the expense of forest.[16] From the Iron Age, beginning in the seventh century BCE, there is evidence of hill forts in southern Scotland that are associated with cultivation ridges and terraces.[17] Souterrains, small underground constructions, may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.[18] Aerial photography reveals extensive prehistoric field systems that underlie existing boundaries in some Lowland areas, suggesting that the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture.[17] During the period of Roman occupation there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for five centuries, suggesting a decline of population and agriculture.[16]\\r\\nThe early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration resulting in more land becoming unproductive.[19] Most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family.[20] The climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn[21] and cattle were the most important domesticated animal.[22] In the period c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and made land more productive.[23] Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying areas such as the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands.[24] The system of infield and outfield agriculture, a variation of open field farming widely used across Europe, may have been introduced with feudalism from the twelfth century[17] and would continue until the eighteenth century.[25] Crops were bere (a form of barley), oats and sometimes wheat, rye and legumes. The more extensive outfield was used for oats.[17] By the late Medieval period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers, known as husbandmen.[26] Runrigs usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective and cheaper to feed than horses.[26] Key crops included kale, hemp and flax. Sheep and goats were probably the main sources of milk, while cattle were raised for meat.[27] The rural economy appears to have boomed in the thirteenth century and in the immediate aftermath of the Black Death was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century.[28]\\r\\nAs feudal distinctions declined in the early modern era, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged to form a new identifiable group, the lairds.[29] With the substantial landholders of the yeomen,[30] these heritors were the major landholding orders.[31] Those with property rights included husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants.[32] Many young people, both male and female, left home to become domestic and agricultural servants.[33] The early modern era also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, of colder and wetter weather, which peaked towards the end of the seventeenth century.[34] Almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic.[35] In the early seventeenth century famine was relatively common, with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625. The English invasions of the 1640s had a profound impact on the Scottish economy.[36] Under the Commonwealth, the country was relatively highly taxed, but gained access to English markets.[37] After the Restoration the formal frontier with England was re-established, along with its customs duties. Economic conditions were generally favourable from 1660 to 1688, as land owners promoted better tillage and cattle-raising.[38] The closing decade of the seventeenth century there was a slump in trade with the Baltic and France and changes in the Scottish cattle trade, followed by four years of failed harvests (1695, 1696 and 1698-9), known as the \\"seven ill years\\".[39] The shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind.[40]\\r\\nIncreasing contacts with England after the Union of 1707 led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility.[41] Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down to combat soil acidity, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture.[41] The result of these changes were the Lowland Clearances, by which hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years.[41] The Highland Clearances saw the forced displacement much of the population of the Highland as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions.[42] Of those that remained many were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue.[43] In the 1840 and 1850s Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis,[44] when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846.[45]\\r\\nIn the twentieth century Scottish agriculture became susceptible to the ups and downs of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in World War II. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. After World War II there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production.[46] There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture and farming became less labour-intensive.[46] The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a change in orientation for Scottish farming. Some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage.[47] A dual farm structure emerged, with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.[48]\\r\\nAt the time of the June 2013 agricultural census the total area of agricultural holdings in Scotland was 5.6 million hectares, equal to 73 per cent of Scotlands total land area. Just over half of this was rough grazing, with about a quarter taken up by grass, and about ten per cent used for crops or left fallow. The remainder was made up of woodland, ponds, yards or other uses. There was a further 580,000 hectares of common grazing, which if included made the total area 6.2 million hectares, or 79 per cent of Scotlands total land area.[49] Because of the persistence of feudalism and the land enclosures of the nineteenth century, the ownership of most land is concentrated in relatively few hands (some 350 people own about half the land). As a result, in 2003 the Scottish Parliament passed a Land Reform Act that empowered tenant farmers and communities to purchase land even if the landlord did not want to sell.[50]\\r\\nIn June 2013, of crops grown in Scotland (excluding grass), cereals accounted for 78 per cent of the land area, with nearly three-quarters of that being barley (340,000 hectares). Wheat was also significant (87,000 hectares), along with oilseed rape (34,000 hectares), oats (32,000 hectares) and potatoes (29,000 hectares). Amongst fruit and vegetables, a total of 911 hectares of strawberries were grown, mainly under cover, which was the largest source of income amongst horticulture crops.[49] The major areas of cereal production were Grampian, Tayside, Borders, Lothian and Fife.[51]\\r\\nLivestock numbers have been falling in recent years. The trend began at the turn of the millennium in the case of pigs and sheep and dates to the mid-1970s in the case of cattle. In June 2013 there were 6.6 million sheep, 1.8 million cattle and 308,000 pigs, the lowest numbers since the 1940 and 1950s. Poultry numbers have tended to fluctuate over the last 25 years, but were down to 14.2 million in 2013.[49]\\r\\nAbout 13,340?km2 of land in Scotland is forested[52] representing around 15 per cent of the total land area of Scotland. The majority of forests are in public ownership, with forestry policy being controlled by the Forestry Commission. The biggest plantations and timber resources are to be found in Dumfries and Galloway, Tayside, Argyll and the area governed by Highland Council. The economic activities generated by forestry in Scotland include planting and harvesting as well as sawmilling, the production of pulp and paper and the manufacture of higher value goods. Forests, especially those surrounding populated areas in Central Scotland also provide a recreation resource.[49]\\r\\nTotal income from farming (TIFF) has been rising since the turn of the millennium. It was estimated at S700 million in 2012, being made up of S2.9 billion in outputs and S570 million in support payments, offset by S2.8 billion in costs. The initial estimate of TIFF for 2013 was S830 million, an increase largely linked to the improved weather. TIFF per annual work unit increased to S31,000, similar to the value in 2011.[49]\\r\\nAquaculture production is focused on the West and North of the country. The total output of aquaculture was estimated in 2011 at around S434 million per year, including around S412 million for farmed Atlantic salmon, S14.34 million for rainbow trout and S7.7 million for shellfish. Brown trout, sea trout, halibut and Arctic charr are also farmed in Scotland.[53]\\r\\nSome farm businesses rely on sources of income other than from farming, including contracting work, hosting mobile phone masts, tourism and recreation and financial support from grants and subsidies. Analysis of the Farm Accounts Survey suggests that, excluding support from grants and subsidies, the average farm made a loss of S16,000 in 2012. However, calculations from TIFF suggest that, excluding support, the sector still made a small profit.[49]\\r\\nGovernment figures indicate that in 2013 Scottish agriculture employed around 1.5 per cent of the workforce and contributes around 1 per cent of the Scottish economy.[49] Other studies suggest the employment rate to be around 8 per cent of the total rural population, and in terms of numbers the estimates indicate that around 68,000 people are directly employed or self-employed in agriculture, while around 200,000 people are related to a variety of activities related to agriculture. In the Highlands and Islands, around 10 per cent of the workforce are engaged in agriculture and livestock products contribute around 70 per cent of the output.[54]\\r\\nThe West of Scotland Agricultural College formed in 1899, the East of Scotland Agricultural College in 1901, and the North of Scotland Agricultural College in 1904; these colleges amalgamated to form the Scottish Agricultural College in 1990.[55]\\r\\nSite-specific nature conservations began in the UK with the creation of the Nature Conservancy in 1948, which later became the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC). It moved from a research-based advisory group to become a campaigning body. The 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act excluded Scotland, but introduced the concept of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which were to become a key part of managing nature conservation.[56] A Countryside Commission Scotland (CSS) was established under the Countryside Scotland Act, 1967.[57] The SSSI were strengthened by the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act, which for the first time introduced the concept of payments to farmers for inactivity in relation to specific sites and shifted the burden of proof from conservationist having to prove harm, to landholders having to prove that harm was not taking place. The NCC was broken up in 1991 and in Scotland was merged with CSS to produce Scottish National Heritage (SNH), under a UK-wide Joint Nature Conservation Committee. SNH has a remit for both land and nature conservation and a responsibility towards sustainability and to the consideration of the needs of the Scottish people.[56]\\r\\nIn Scotland, a right of way is a route over which the public has been able to pass unhindered for at least 20 years.[58] The route must link two \\"public places\\", such as villages, churches or roads. Unlike in England and Wales there is no obligation on Scottish local authorities to signpost or mark a right of way. However, the charity Scotways, formed in 1845 to protect rights of way, records and signs the routes.[59] The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives everyone statutory access rights to most land and inland water in Scotland, to non-motorized traffic, making the existence of rights of way less important in terms of access to land in Scotland. Certain categories of land are excluded from this presumption of open access, such as railway land, airfields and private gardens.[60]","input":"What kind of crops are grown in scotland?"},{"output":"American control","context":"The Capture of Guam was a bloodless event between the United States and the Kingdom of Spain during the SpanishÿAmerican War. The U.S. Navy sent a single cruiser, the USS?Charleston, to capture the island of Guam, then under Spanish control. However, the Spanish garrison on the island had no knowledge of the war and no real defenses. They surrendered without resistance and the island passed into American control. The event was the only conflict of the SpanishÿAmerican War on Guam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGuam had been under Spanish control since 1668. By the time of the war, however, Guam had been neglected and there were only light defenses. The last message the authorities on Guam had received from Spain was dated April 14, 1898 a month before war was declared. Henry Glass, captain of the cruiser Charleston, was en route from California to Manila when in Honolulu he was joined by three transport ships, the City of Peking, the City of Sydney, and the Australia.[1] Then in the Pacific he opened his sealed orders that read,\\r\\nNAVY DEPARTMENT\\r\\nWashington, May 10, 1898.\\r\\nSIR:\\r\\nUpon the receipt of this order, which is forwarded by the steamship City of Pekin to you at Honolulu, you will proceed, with the Charleston and the City of Pekin in company, to Manila, Philippine Islands. On your way, you are hereby directed to stop at the Spanish Island of Guam. You will use such force as may be necessary to capture the port of Guam, making prisoners of the governor and other officials and any armed force that may be there. You will also destroy any fortifications on said island and any Spanish naval vessels that may be there, or in the immediate vicinity. These operations at the Island of Guam should be very brief, and should not occupy more than one or two days. Should you find any coal at the Island of Guam, you will make such use of it as you consider desirable. It is left to your discretion whether or not you destroy it. From the Island of Guam, proceed to Manila and report to Rear-Admiral George Dewey, U.S.N., for duty in the squadron under his command.\\r\\nVery respectfully,\\r\\nJOHN D. LONG\\r\\nSecretary Commanding Officer U.S.S. Charleston.[2]\\r\\nThe message created intense excitement and enthusiasm among the seamen. Many of them immediately went to the ship's library and eagerly scrutinized charts, geographies, histories, and encyclopedias for information.[2] While the sailors were in the ship's library learning this information about the island of Guam, Captain Glass altered the direction of the cruiser toward the new destination. The soldiers and sailors on the transports were stirred when they noticed the change in direction, and rumors started instantly. Some thought the expedition was to hoist the American flag over the Caroline Islands and remain there until reinforcements arrived for a stronger descent upon Manila. Others guessed that the Charleston was sailing to some mysterious island of Spain, complete with impregnable fortifications, a formidable force of Spanish soldiers, and vast quantities of coal. The rumor mongering stopped the next day, when the correct news was wigwagged to the transports.[3]\\r\\nAlong with the sealed orders were warnings of possible Spanish men of war in San Luis d'Apra, the main port of Guam, and notification of it being protected by a heavy battery of guns. The existence of the heavy armament was verified by reputable travelers who had visited the island within the two or three years before 1898. Definite information of the size of the Spanish garrison was not given, and in the absence of direct knowledge, the captain of the cruiser had to assume that there might be more than a thousand fighting men on the island who were thoroughly familiar with the terrain. Glass held a conference on the Australia, and invited General Anderson, Commander William C. Gibson, naval officer in charge of the transports, and the captains of the three troop carriers were invited to participate in the discussions. Also present at the meeting was T. A. Hallet, third officer of the Australia and a former whaling captain, who had been to the Mariana Islands many times. Hallet told the group that on his last visit to Guam, San Luis d'Apra was strongly fortified. Fort Santa Cruz and the battery on Point Orote, he stated, were efficiently manned and equipped. After a complete appraisal of all the known and unknown factors in the impending battle, the officers completed the arrangements for the attack on Guam.[3]\\r\\nIt was soon noticed by the troops that the Charleston expected a fight, since the cruiser began firing subcaliber ammunition at boxes tossed from the City of Peking. This mild training continued until the afternoon of June 15, when the American cruiser started circling and firing service charges at pyramidal cloth targets set adrift from the cruiser herself. The range was about 2?mi (1.7?nmi; 3.2?km), and the gun crews, which were composed largely of the green recruits under the command of Second Lieutenant John Twiggs Myers, were shooting accurately enough to cause Captain Glass to smile pleasantly. By the time the convoy crossed the 180th meridian, the officers and men felt they were ready for the enemy.[4]\\r\\nOn June 20, Captain Glass arrived off the shore of Guam, and he noticed that the only ship in the harbor was a Japanese ship that was trading copra. Many of the men on the USS Charleston were disappointed that there were no Spanish ships to engage.[4]\\r\\nAs the cruiser proceeded on its way, a small group of curious inhabitants gathered on the shores of Piti, a landing place down the bay. These locals were aware of the presence of the American vessels, for they had been sighted early that morning. All of the important citizens of Guam were there with the exception of the governor, Don Juan Marina. The chief officials present were a lieutenant commander of the navy and captain of the port, Don Francisco Gutirrez, Don Jos Romero, naval surgeon, and Captain Pedro Duarte Anducar of the marine corps, and Jos Sixto, civil paymaster. Among the prominent civilians at the beach were Francisco Portusach, the leading merchant of Guam, and his brother Jos Portusach. While the gathering was looking curiously at the cruiser and the three transports, the Charleston fired 13 rounds at the old Spanish fortress from three of her guns. There was no return fire, and there was no apparent damage to the fort.[5] Pedro Duarte turned to his companions and said that the ship must be saluting the fort, so he hurriedly dispatched a messenger to Agana, the capital, which was about 6?mi (9.7?km) away, requesting the governor to send artillery to Piti to return the salute. The captain of the port, the naval surgeon, and a native Chamorro named Jos Paloma got into a boat furnished by Francisco Portusach and went out to welcome the visitors. Jos Portusach went along with the party to act as interpreter. When they finally got aboard the deck of the Charleston, Glass immediately informed them that war had been declared between the U.S. and Spain.[5]\\r\\nThe Spanish officials were amazed when they heard this and the news that they were now prisoners of war, because no dispatches or mail had arrived since April 9 to enlighten them. They were then paroled for the day when they promised to return to Agana to inform the governor of the war and notify him to appear on board the American ship immediately. The party then went below deck into the captain's cabin to discuss the surrender of the island.[6]\\r\\nAs they were going below, Francisco Portusach sailed across the bow of the Charleston in a whaleboat with the American flag at the topmast. A loud voice from the ship called, \\"Frank, come on board.\\" Portusach looked up to the deck and saw Captain Hallett, a man whom he had known years before. The skipper of the whaleboat then went to the lee side of the cruiser and clambered aboard. When he reached the deck, he was surprised to find a reporter with whom he was acquainted, a representative of the San Francisco Chronicle. While the reporter and the old whaling captain were talking about old times, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther, the navigator, walked up to Portusach and demanded to know by what right he was hoisting the American flag at the topmast of the little boat. The Guam merchant merely grinned and replied the flag was being flown legally. The lieutenant promptly requested proof, and Portusach produced American naturalization papers from an inside coat pocket and handed them to the doubting Braunersreuther who looked at them and said, \\"Well! Twenty-second of October, 1888, Chicago, Cook County, State of Illinois.\\" The navigator examined the document more thoroughly and requested Portusach to accompany him to visit Glass. The \\"welcoming party\\" had just departed for shore, so the two men entered the captain's cabin, and the lieutenant handed the naturalization papers to Glass who looked at them for a few moments. He had already heard from Jos Portusach that Francisco possessed some lighters and boats, so he greeted the merchant by inquiring if it was possible to obtain the use of two lighters and a boat to transfer coal from the City of Peking to the bunkers of the Charleston and offered to pay for the service. Portusach agreed to furnish the boats without compensation since he felt an obligation, as the only United States citizen on the island, to aid his country in time of war.[6]\\r\\nFrancisco Portusach returned to Piti where his brother was waiting for him, and was informed that the Spanish officers were under arrest, but had been paroled with the understanding that they would deliver themselves on board the Charleston so they might be taken to Manila as prisoners of war. Francisco then ordered his head boatman, Tiburcio de los Santos, and several of his men to deliver the lighters and boats to the Charleston early in the morning. The two brothers got into their buggy and started for Agana. On the road home they met several soldiers who were struggling with two small artillery pieces which had been turned back by Captain Duarte since it was not necessary to salute the American cruiser.[6]\\r\\nWhen they arrived home, a letter was waiting for Francisco from Governor Marina which said: \\"If you give any assistance to the American men of war, you will be executed tomorrow morning at the beach.\\" After reading the note, Guam's leading merchant laughed. His wife, an American woman he had married in San Francisco, asked what was in the message, and became apprehensive when he told her. Jose warned him to be careful, especially when he learned that boats had already been promised to the Americans. His brother replied that the boats would be delivered in the morning regardless of the threatening message.[7]\\r\\nLater that afternoon, Francisco Portusach, despite the display of bravado, was worried, so he returned to the Charleston with the threatening note from Marina and showed it to Glass. They had conferred less than half an hour when the governor's secretary came back to the cruiser with a letter which said:\\r\\nAgana, June 20, 1898.\\r\\nMr. Henry Glass,\\r\\nCaptain of the North American Cruiser Charleston:\\r\\nBy the captain of the port in which you have cast anchor I have been courteously requested, as a soldier, and, above all, as a gentleman, to hold a conference with you, adding that you have advised him that war has been declared between our respective nations, and that you have come for the purpose of occupying these Spanish islands.\\r\\nIt would give me great pleasure to comply with his request and see you personally, but, as the military laws of my country prohibit me from going on board a foreign vessel, I regret to have to decline this honor and to ask that you will kindly come on shore, where I await you to accede to your wishes as far as possible, and to agree as to our mutual situations. Asking your pardon for the trouble I cause you, I guarantee your safe return to your ship.\\r\\nVery respectfully,\\r\\nJUAN MARINA\\r\\nThe Governor [7]\\r\\nBy this time, Glass suspected that the governor was perpetrating a trick. An ultimatum was prepared for delivery to the governor of Guam and arrangements were made for a presentation of it on the following morning. At 08:00 the next morning, Lieutenant Braunersreuther was waiting to take command of a landing party composed of the Marine guard of the Charleston, the Marines from City of Peking, and two companies of the Oregon volunteer regiment on the Australia. He was had specific instructions to go ashore and capture the governor, his officers, and any armed forces on the island.[7]\\r\\nThe men had difficulty in getting the boats ready, so the lieutenant left without them in a small boat, merely taking with him Ensign Waldo Evans, four sailors, and two newspaper reporters, Douglas White and Sol Sheridan. He landed at the harbor of Piti under a flag of truce and there he was met by Governor Marina and his staff. After formal introduction, Braunersreuther handed the governor this ultimatum from Captain Glass: \\"Sir: In reply to your communication of this date I have now, in compliance with the orders of my government, to demand the immediate surrender of the defenses of the Island of Guam, with arms of all kinds, all officials and persons in the military service of Spain now in this island. This communication will be handed you tomorrow morning by an officer who is ordered to wait not over one half hour for your reply.\\"[8]\\r\\nThen Braunersreuther called the governor's attention to the fact that only 30 minutes were allowed for a reply, and casually reminded him of the three transports loaded with troops and the formidable war vessel in the harbor. Marina and his advisers went into a nearby boatshed for consultation. Twenty-nine minutes later, they reappeared and handed the lieutenant a sealed envelope addressed to the commanding officer of the Charleston. The captain's emissary, amid vigorous protestations from the governor, broke the seal and read the message which contained a notification of the surrender of the island of Guam. He then said, \\"Gentlemen, you are now my prisoners; you will have to repair on board the Charleston with me.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe governor protested, claiming that he had not expected such action. He accused the lieutenant of treachery, as the Americans had come ashore under a flag of truce, before making the Spaniards prisoners of war. Braunersreuther replied that he had merely been instructed to deliver a letter and since he was now in possession of an offer of complete surrender, the Americans were permitted to make any demand they wished. The Spanish officials were allowed to write letters to their families. Afterward, Marina and his staff were taken to City of Sydney after sending an order to Agana for the Spanish soldiery and native militia to be at Piti landing no later than four o'clock that afternoon.[8]\\r\\nBraunsreuther then returned to the ships, obtained the marine guard, and returned to shore. There, according to agreement, the Spanish soldiers were lined up awaiting surrender. Lieutenant John Twiggs Myers, later known for his command during the Boxer Rebellion, marched the Marines through the boathouse and lined them up so that the Spanish and native troops were between the Americans and the ocean.[8] The 54 Spanish regulars and two lieutenants were disarmed, placed in a sampan, and transported to the City of Sydney.\\r\\nGlass went ashore and raised an American flag over the fortifications while the bands aboard the Australia and Peking played \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". His orders included destroying the island's forts, but Glass decided that they were in such disrepair that he left them as they were.[1]\\r\\nFrancisco Portusach and his workers finally completed transferring the coal from City of Peking to Charleston on June 22. Afterward, Glass took him to his cabin, and appointed him Governor of the island, until the arrival of proper American authority.

(katholou), meaning \\"on the whole\\", \\"according to the whole\\" or \\"in general\\", and is a combination of the Greek words ϫ? meaning \\"about\\" and ?? meaning \\"whole\\".[3][4] The term Catholic (usually written with uppercase C in English) was first used to describe the Christian Church in the early 2nd century to emphasize its universal scope. In the context of Christian ecclesiology, it has a rich history and several usages.\\r\\nThe word in English can mean either \\"of the Roman Catholic faith\\" or \\"relating to the historic doctrine and practice of the Western Church\\".[5][note 1] Many Christians use it to refer more broadly to the whole Christian Church or to all believers in Jesus Christ regardless of denominational affiliation;[6][7] it can also more narrowly refer to Catholicity, which encompasses several historic churches sharing major beliefs. \\"Catholicos\\", the title used for the head of some churches in Eastern Christian traditions, is derived from the same linguistic origin.\\r\\nIn non-ecclesiastical use, it derives its English meaning directly from its root, and is currently used to mean the following:\\r\\nThe term has been incorporated into the name of the largest Christian communion, the Roman Catholic Church (also called the Catholic Church). All of the three main branches of Christianity in the East (Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and Church of the East) had always identified themselves as Catholic in accordance with Apostolic traditions and the Nicene Creed. Anglicans, Lutherans, and some Methodists also believe that their churches are \\"Catholic\\" in the sense that they too are in continuity with the original universal church founded by the Apostles. However, each church defines the scope of the \\"Catholic Church\\" differently. For instance, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox churches, and Church of the East, each maintain that their own denomination is identical with the original universal church, from which all other denominations broke away.\\r\\nDistinguishing beliefs of Catholicity, the beliefs of most Christians who call themselves \\"Catholic\\", include the episcopal polity, that bishops are considered the highest order of ministers within the Christian religion,[9] as well as the Nicene Creed of AD 381. In particular, along with unity, sanctity, and apostolicity, catholicity is considered one of Four Marks of the Church,[10] found the line of the Nicene Creed: \\"I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.\\"\\r\\nDuring the medieval and modern times, additional distinctions arose regarding the use of the terms Western Catholic and Eastern Catholic. Before the EastÿWest Schism, those terms had just the basic geographical meanings, since only one undivided Catholicity existed, uniting the Latin speaking Christians of West and the Greek speaking Christians of the East. After the split of 1054 terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and confronting terminological systems.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek adjective katholikos, the origin of the term \\"catholic\\" means \\"universal\\". Directly from the Greek, or via Late Latin catholicus, the term catholic entered many other languages, becoming the base for the creation of various theological terms such as catholicism and catholicity (Late Latin catholicismus, catholicitas).\\r\\nThe term \\"catholicism\\" is the English form of Late Latin catholicismus, an abstract noun based on the adjective \\"catholic\\". The Modern Greek equivalent ϫĲ?? (katholikismos) is back-formed and usually refers to the Catholic Church.\\r\\nThe terms \\"catholic\\", \\"catholicism\\" and \\"catholicity\\" is closely related to the use of the term Catholic Church. The earliest evidence of the use of that term is the Letter to the Smyrnaeans that Ignatius of Antioch wrote in about 108 to Christians in Smyrna. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their bishop, he wrote: \\"Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\\"[12][13]\\r\\nFrom the second half of the second century, the word \\"catholic\\" began to be used to mean \\"orthodox\\" (non-heretical), \\"because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local\\".[14] In 380, Emperor Theodosius I limited use of the term \\"Catholic Christian\\" exclusively to those who followed the same faith as Pope Damasus I of Rome and Pope Peter of Alexandria.[15] Numerous other early writers including Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315ÿ386), Augustine of Hippo (354ÿ430) further developed the use of the term \\"catholic\\" in relation to Christianity.\\r\\nThe earliest recorded evidence of the use of the term \\"Catholic Church\\" is the Letter to the Smyrnaeans that Ignatius of Antioch wrote in about 107 to Christians in Smyrna. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their bishop, he wrote: \\"Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\\"[12][16][17]\\r\\nOf the meaning for Ignatius of this phrase J.H. Srawley wrote:\\r\\nThis is the earliest occurrence in Christian literature of the phrase 'the Catholic Church' (? ϫĲ? ?ٰҿ?ϫ). The original sense of the word is 'universal'. Thus Justin Martyr (Dial. 82) speaks of the 'universal or general resurrection', using the words ? ϫĲ? ??ϫ?. Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the particular Church of Smyrna. Ignatius means by the Catholic Church 'the aggregate of all the Christian congregations' (Swete, Apostles Creed, p. 76). So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed to all the congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place. And this primitive sense of 'universal' the word has never lost, although in the latter part of the second century it began to receive the secondary sense of 'orthodox' as opposed to 'heretical'. Thus it is used in an early Canon of Scripture, the Muratorian fragment (circa 170 A.D.), which refers to certain heretical writings as 'not received in the Catholic Church'. So too Cyril of Jerusalem, in the fourth century, says that the Church is called Catholic not only 'because it is spread throughout the world', but also 'because it teaches completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the knowledge of men'. This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local.[18][19]\\r\\nBy Catholic Church Ignatius designated the universal church. Ignatius considered that certain heretics of his time, who disavowed that Jesus was a material being who actually suffered and died, saying instead that \\"he only seemed to suffer\\" (Smyrnaeans, 2), were not really Christians.[20]\\r\\nThe term is also used in the Martyrdom of Polycarp (155) and in the Muratorian fragment (about 177).\\r\\nAs mentioned in the above quotation from J.H. Srawley, Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315ÿ386), who is venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion, distinguished what he called the \\"Catholic Church\\" from other groups who could also refer to themselves as an ?ٰҿ?ϫ (assembly or church):\\r\\nSince the word Ecclesia is applied to different things (as also it is written of the multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians, And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly (Acts 19:14), and since one might properly and truly say that there is a Church of evil doers, I mean the meetings of the heretics, the Marcionists and Manichees, and the rest, for this cause the Faith has securely delivered to you now the Article, \\"And in one Holy Catholic Church\\"; that you may avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy Church Catholic in which you were regenerated. And if ever you are sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son of God(Catechetical Lectures, XVIII, 26).[21]\\r\\nTheodosius I, Emperor from 379 to 395, declared \\"Catholic\\" Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, declaring in the Edict of Thessalonica of 27 February 380:\\r\\nIt is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our clemency and moderation, should continue the profession of that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, let us believe in the one Deity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title Catholic Christians; but as for the others, since in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give their conventicles the name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation, and in the second the punishment which our authority, in accordance with the will of heaven, will decide to inflict.[22] Theodosian Code XVI.i.2\\r\\nOnly slightly later, Saint Augustine of Hippo (354ÿ430) also used the term \\"Catholic\\" to distinguish the \\"true\\" church from heretical groups:\\r\\nIn the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of the Apostle Peter, to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge to feed His sheep (Jn 21:15ÿ19), down to the present episcopate.\\r\\nAnd so, lastly, does the very name of Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.\\r\\nSuch then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should ... With you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me... No one shall move me from the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion... For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.?St. Augustine (354ÿ430): Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental, chapter 4: Proofs of the Catholic Faith.\\r\\nA contemporary of Augustine, St. Vincent of Lerins, wrote in 434 (under the pseudonym Peregrinus) a work known as the Commonitoria (\\"Memoranda\\"). While insisting that, like the human body, church doctrine develops while truly keeping its identity (sections 54-59, chapter XXIII),[24] he stated:\\r\\nIn the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all. For that is truly and in the strictest sense 'catholic,' which, as the name itself and the reason of the thing declare, comprehends all universally. This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one faith to be true, which the whole church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and determinations of all, or at the least of almost all priests and doctors.\\r\\nDuring early centuries of Christian history, majority of Christians who followed doctrines represented in Nicene Creed were bound by one common and undivided Catholicity that was uniting the Latin speaking Christians of West and the Greek speaking Christians of the East. In those days, terms \\"eastern Catholic\\" and \\"western Catholic\\" had their basic geographical meanings, generally corresponding to existing linguistic distinctions between Greek East and Latin West. In spite of various and quite frequent theological and ecclesiastical disagreements between major Christian sees, common Catholicity was preserved until the great disputes that arose between 9th and 11th century. After the EastÿWest Schism, the notion of common Catholicity was broken and each side started to develop its own terminological practice.[11]\\r\\nAll major theological and ecclesiastical disputes in the Christian East or West have been commonly accompanied by attempts of arguing sides to deny each other the right to use the word \\"Catholic\\" as term of self-designation. After the acceptance of Filioque clause into the Nicene Creed by the Rome, Orthodox Christians in the East started to refer to adherents of Filioquism in the West just as \\"Latins\\" considering them no longer to be \\"Catholics\\".[11]\\r\\nThe dominant view in the Eastern Orthodox Church, that all Western Christians who accepted Filioque interpolation and unorthodox Pneumatology ceased to be Catholics, was held and promoted by famous Eastern Orthodox canonist Theodore Balsamon who was patriarch of Antioch. He wrote in 1190:\\r\\nFor many years the once illustrious congregation of the Western Church, that is to say, the Church of Rome, has been divided in spiritual communion from the other four Patriarchates, and has separated itself by adopting customs and dogmas alien to the Catholic Church and to the Orthodox ... So no Latin should be sanctified by the hands of the priests through divine and spotless Mysteries unless he first declares that he will abstain from Latin dogmas and customs, and that he will conform to the practice of the Orthodox.[26]\\r\\nOn the other side of the widening rift, Eastern Orthodox were considered by western theologians to be Schismatics. Relations between East and West were further estranged by the tragic events of the Massacre of the Latins in 1182 and Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Those bloody events were followed by several failed attempts to reach reconciliation (see: Second Council of Lyon, Council of Florence, Union of Brest, Union of Uzhhorod). During the late medieval and early modern period, terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and confronting terminological systems that exist today in all of their complexity.\\r\\nDuring the Early Modern period, a special term \\"Acatholic\\" was widely used in the West to mark all those who were considered to hold heretical theological views and irregular ecclesiastical practices. In the time of Counter-Reformation the term Acatholic was used by zealous members of the Catholic Church to designate Protestants as well as Eastern Orthodox Christians. The term was considered to be so insulting that the Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church, held in Temeswar in 1790, decided to send an official plea to emperor Leopold II, begging him to ban the use of the term \\"Acatholic\\".[27]\\r\\nThe Augsburg Confession found within the Book of Concord, a compendium of belief of the Lutheran Churches, teaches that \\"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\\".[28] When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530, they believe to have \\"showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils\\".[28]\\r\\nThe term \\"Catholic\\" is commonly associated with the whole of the church led by the Roman Pontiff, the Catholic Church. Other Christian churches that use the description \\"Catholic\\" include the Eastern Orthodox Church and other churches that believe in the historic episcopate (bishops), such as the Anglican Communion.[29][30] Many of those who apply the term \\"Catholic Church\\" to all Christians object to the use of the term to designate what they view as only one church within what they understand as the \\"whole\\" Catholic Church. In the English language, the first known use of the term is in Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland, \\"He was a constant Catholic/All Lollard he hated and heretic.\\"[31]\\r\\nThe Catholic Church, led by the Pope in Rome, usually distinguishes itself from other churches by calling itself the \\"Catholic\\", however has also used the description \\"Roman Catholic\\". Even apart from documents drawn up jointly with other churches, it has sometimes, in view of the central position it attributes to the See of Rome, adopted the adjective \\"Roman\\" for the whole church, Eastern as well as Western, as in the papal encyclicals Divini illius Magistri and Humani generis. Another example is its self-description as \\"the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church\\"[32] (or, by separating each adjective, as the \\"Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church\\"[33]) in the 24 April 1870 Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith of the First Vatican Council. In all of these documents it also refers to itself both simply as the Catholic Church and by other names. The Eastern Catholic Churches, while united with Rome in the faith, have their own traditions and laws, differing from those of the Latin Rite and those of other Eastern Catholic Churches.\\r\\nThe contemporary Catholic Church has always considered itself to be the historic Catholic Church, and consider all others as \\"non-Catholics\\". This practice is an application of the belief that not all who claim to be Christians are part of the Catholic Church, as Ignatius of Antioch, the earliest known writer to use the term \\"Catholic Church\\", considered that certain heretics who called themselves Christians only seemed to be such.[34]\\r\\nRegarding the relations with Eastern Christians, Pope Benedict XVI stated his wish to restore full unity with the Orthodox. The Roman Catholic Church considers that almost all of the ancient theological differences have been satisfactorily addressed (the Filioque clause, the nature of purgatory, etc.), and has declared that differences in traditional customs, observances and discipline are no obstacle to unity.[35]\\r\\nRecent historic ecumenical efforts on the part of the Catholic Church have focused on healing the rupture between the Western (\\"Catholic\\") and the Eastern (\\"Orthodox\\") churches. Pope John Paul II often spoke of his great desire that the Catholic Church \\"once again breathe with both lungs\\",[36][37] thus emphasizing that the Roman Catholic Church seeks to restore full communion with the separated Eastern churches.[38]\\r\\nAll of the three main branches of Christianity in the East (Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and Church of the East) are continuing to identify themselves as Catholic in accordance with Apostolic traditions and the Nicene Creed.[39] The Eastern Orthodox Church firmly upholds the ancient doctrines of Eastern Orthodox Catholicity and commonly uses the term Catholic, as in the title of The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church. So does the Coptic Orthodox Church that belongs to Oriental Orthodoxy and considers its communion to be \\"the True Church of the Lord Jesus Christ\\".[40] Non of the Eastern Churches, Orthodox or Oriental, have any intention to abandon ancient traditions of their own Catholicity.\\r\\nMost Reformation and post-Reformation churches use the term Catholic (often with a lower-case c) to refer to the belief that all Christians are part of one Church regardless of denominational divisions; e.g., Chapter XXV of the Westminster Confession of Faith refers to the \\"catholic or universal Church\\". It is in line with this interpretation, which applies the word \\"catholic\\" (universal) to no one denomination, that they understand the phrase \\"one holy catholic and apostolic Church\\" in the Nicene Creed, the phrase the Catholic faith in the Athanasian Creed and the phrase \\"holy catholic church\\" in the Apostles' Creed.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe term is used also to mean those Christian churches that maintain that their episcopate can be traced unbrokenly back to the apostles and consider themselves part of a catholic (universal) body of believers. Among those who regard themselves as Catholic but not Roman Catholic are Anglicans[citation needed] and Lutherans,[28] who stress that they are both Reformed and Catholic. The Old Catholic Church and the various groups classified as Independent Catholic Churches also lay claim to the description Catholic. Traditionalist Catholics, even if they may not be in communion with Rome, consider themselves to be not only Catholics but the \\"true\\" Roman Catholics.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome use the term \\"Catholic\\" to distinguish their own position from a Calvinist or Puritan form of Reformed-Protestantism. These include a faction of Anglicans often also called Anglo-Catholics, 19th century Neo-Lutherans, 20th century High Church Lutherans or evangelical-Catholics and others.\\r\\nMethodists and Presbyterians believe their denominations owe their origins to the Apostles and the early church, but do not claim descent from ancient church structures such as the episcopate. However, both of these churches hold that they are a part of the catholic (universal) church. According to Harper's New Monthly Magazine:\\r\\nThe various Protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no intercommunion...each Protestant Church, whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever, is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic; and in this respect, consequently, the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority, except in the point of numbers. As a further necessary consequence, it is plain that the Roman Church is no more Catholic in any sense than a Methodist or a Baptist.[41]\\r\\nAs such, according to one viewpoint, for those who \\"belong to the Church,\\" the term Methodist Catholic, or Presbyterian Catholic, or Baptist Catholic, is as proper as the term Roman Catholic.[42] It simply means that body of Christian believers over the world who agree in their religious views, and accept the same ecclesiastical forms.[42]\\r\\nSome Independent Catholics accept that, among bishops, that of Rome is primus inter pares, and hold that conciliarism is a necessary check against ultramontanism. They are however, by definition, not recognised by the Catholic Church.\\r\\nSome Protestant churches avoid using the term completely, to the extent among many Lutherans of reciting the Creed with the word \\"Christian\\" in place of \\"catholic\\".[43][44][45] The Orthodox churches share some of the concerns about Roman Catholic papal claims, but disagree with some Protestants about the nature of the church as one body.","input":"When was the term catholic church first used?"},{"output":"approximately 2800 BC","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia has a road network of over 5,603,293 kilometres (3,481,725?mi) as on 31 March 2016, the second largest road network in the world.[1] At 1.70?km of roads per square kilometre of land, the quantitative density of India's road network is higher than that of Japan (0.91) and the United States (0.67), and far higher than that of China (0.46), Brazil (0.18) or Russia (0.08).[1] Adjusted for its large population, India has approximately 4.63?km of roads per 1000 people.

Private builders and highway operators are also implementing major projects - for example, the Yamuna Expressway between Delhi and Agra was completed ahead of schedule and within budget,[5] while the KMP Expressway started in 2006 is far behind schedule, over budget and incomplete.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 2009 estimates by Goldman Sachs, India will need to invest US$1.7 trillion on infrastructure projects before 2020 to meet its economic needs, a part of which would be in upgrading India's road network.[7] The investment in national highways increased from ?14,095.87 crore (US$2.1?billion) in 2005-06 to ?98,988.06 crore (US$14?billion) in 2015-16.[1]\\r\\nDuring the same period the total investment in national highways was ?476,589.37 crore (US$69?billion). The Government of India is attempting to promote foreign investment in road projects.[7][8][9] Foreign participation in Indian road network construction has attracted 45 international contractors and 40 design/engineering consultants, with Malaysia, South Korea, United Kingdom and United States being the largest players.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first evidence of road development in the Indian subcontinent can be traced back to approximately 2800 BC from the ancient cities of Harrapa and Mohenjodaro of the Indus Valley Civilization. Ruling emperors and monarchs of ancient India had constructed roads to connect the cities. Archaeological excavations give us fresh information about road connectivity in ancient India. The Grand Trunk Road was built by Sher Shah Suri in 1540-45 connecting Sonargaon near Dhaka in Bangladesh with Peshawar in modern-day Pakistan linking several cities from in India.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1830s the East India Company started a programme of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes. The Grand trunk road, from Calcutta, through Delhi to Peshawar was rebuilt at a cost of S1000 / mile, roads from Bombay to Pune Camp, Bombay to Agra, and Bombay to Madras, were constructed, and a Public Works Department, and the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee founded, to train and employ local surveyors, engineers, and overseers, to perform the work, and maintain the roads. The programme resulted in an estimated 2,500?km (1,600 miles) of metalled roads being constructed by the 1850s[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1934 the Indian Road Congress (IRC) was formed, on the recommendations of the Indian Road Development Committee (Jayakar Committee) of the Government of India. They proposed a twenty-year plan, in 1943, to increase the road network from 350,000?km (220,000 miles), to 532,700?km (331,000 miles) by 1963, to achieve a road density of 16?km, per 100 km2 of land. The construction was to be paid in part through the duty imposed, since 1939, on petrol sales, and became known as the Nagpur Plan. The construction target was achieved in the late 1950s.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1956 a Highways Act was passed, and a second twenty-year plan proposed for the period 1961-1981, with the ambition of doubling road density to 32?km, per 100 km2. This second plan became known as the Bombay Road Plan.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia inherited a poor road network infrastructure at the time of its independence in 1947. Beyond that, between 1947 and 1988, India witnessed no new major projects, and the roads were poorly maintained. Predominantly all roads were single lane, and most were unpaved. India had no expressways, and less than 200 kilometers of 4-lane highways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, an autonomous entity called the National Highways Authority of India was established in India by an Act of Parliament, and came into existence on 15 June 1989. The Act empowered this entity to develop, maintain and manage India's road network through National Highways. However, even though the Authority was created in 1988, not much happened till India introduced widespread economic liberalization in the early 1990s. Since 1995, the authority has privatized road network development in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most ambitious projects to improve roads in India was under the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) started in the year 1998 by then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The flagship project of the  NHDP is the Golden Quadrilateral, a total of 5,846?km long  4/6 laned highways connecting the four major cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Total cost of the project is Rs.300 billion (US$6.8 billion), funded largely by the governments special petroleum product tax revenues and government borrowing. In January 2012, India announced the four-lane GQ highway network as complete.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important road project is the 7,142?km long 4/6 laned NorthÿSouth and EastÿWest Corridor comprising national highways connecting four extreme points of the country. The NorthÿSouth and EastÿWest Corridor connects Srinagar in the north to Kanyakumari in the south, including spur from Salem to Kanyakumari (via Coimbatore and Kochi) and Silchar in the east to Porbandar in the west. As of 31 October 2016, 90.99% of the project had been completed, 5.47% of the project work is under Implementation and 3.52% of the total length is left.[19] As of May 2017, under NHDP about 28,915 kilometers of 4/6 lane highways has been constructed (including the GQ and E-W/N-S Corridor), while a total of 48,793?km of road has been planned to be 4/6 laned under the NHDP.[20]\\r\\nRoad transport is vital to India's economy. It enables the country's transportation sector to contribute 4.7 percent towards Indias gross domestic product, in comparison to railways that contributed 1 percent, in 2009ÿ2010. Road transport has gained its importance over the years despite significant barriers and inefficiencies in inter-state freight and passenger movement compared to railways and air. The government of India considers road network as critical to the country's development, social integration and security needs of the country.[21] India's road network carries over 65 percent of its freight and about 85 percent of passenger traffic.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian road network is administered by various government authorities, given India's federal form of government. The following table shows the total length of India's road network by type of road as on 31 March 2016.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, roads in India are primarily bitumen-based macadamised roads.  However, a few of the National Highways have concrete roads too. In some locations, such as in Kanpur, British-built concrete roads are still in use. Concrete roads were less popular prior to the 1990s because of low availability of cement then. However, with large supplies of cement in the country and the virtues of concrete roads, they are gaining popularity. Concrete roads are durable, weather-proof and require lower maintenance compared to bituminous roads. Moreover, new concrete pavement technology has developed such as cool pavement, quiet pavement and permeable pavement, which has rendered it more attractive and eco-friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia road building rate has accelerated in recent years and averaged about 12 kilometres (7.5?mi) kilometers per day in 2014-15 to 27 kilometres (17?mi) per day in 2017-18.[23] The country targets to build 40 kilometers of highways every day.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBharatmala, a centrally-sponsored and funded road and highways project of the Government of India [25] with a target of constructing 83,677?km (51,994?mi)[26] of new highways at an estimated cost of ?5.35 trillion (US$78?billion) has been started in 2017.  Bharatmala Phase -I plans to construct 34,800?km of highways (including remaining projects under NHDP) at an estimated cost of Rs.5,35,000 crore by 2021-22.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mumbai-Pune Yashwant Rao Chavan Expressway is India's first expressway. It is built with cement and its total valuation to date is ?90,000 crore (US$13?billion)[citation needed].\\r\\nExpressways make up approximately 1,208?km (751?mi) of India's road network, as of 2013.[28][29] These high-speed roads are four-lane or six-lane, predominantly access controlled. The 165 kilometer Yamuna Expressway, a six-laned controlled-access opened on 9 August 2012.[30] On 21 November 2016, India's longest expressway - the 302?km long six-laned Agra Lucknow Expressway was opened.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the start of several expressway projects such as the Ganga Expressway have been delayed for 3 or more years, because of litigation and bureaucratic procedures. The government has drawn up a target to lay 18,637 kilometre network of brand new expressways by 2022.[33] Most of the existing expressways in India are toll roads.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main highways running through the length and breadth of the country connecting major ports, state capitals, large industrial and tourist centres, etc. National Highways in India are designated as NH followed by the highway number. Indian national highways are further classified based on the width of carriageway of the highway. As of March 2016, India had completed and placed in use 1,01,011?km of national highways.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is the authority responsible for the development, maintenance and management of National Highways entrusted to it. The NHAI is undertaking the developmental activities under National Highways Development Project (NHDP) in 5 phases. From 2018, the pending projects under NHDP will be subsumed under Bharatmala.  The NHAI is also responsible for implementing other projects on National Highways, primarily road connectivity to major ports in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nState Governments have the authority and responsibility to build road networks and state highways. Most of the state highways are developed by State PWD. The State Highways provide linkages with the National Highways, district headquarters, important towns, tourist centers and minor ports and carry the traffic along major centers within the state. As of 31 March 2016, the total length of state highways was 176,166?km.[34] As of 31 March, 2016  Maharashtra has the largest share in the total length of SH roads (22.14%), followed by Karnataka (11.11%), Gujarat (9.76%), Rajasthan (8.62%) and Tamil Nadu (6.67%).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent of the NHDP program, state governments have been implementing a number of state highway projects since 2000. By 2010, state highway projects worth $1.7 billion had been completed, and an additional $11.4 billion worth of projects were under implementation.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are important roads within a district connecting areas of production with markets and connecting them with the State Highways & National Highways and are maintained by the Zila Parishad. District roads are sub-classified into - Major District Roads and Other District Roads. As per the classification of roads broadly the MDRs are to have a minimum width of 15 metres with traffic density of less than 10,000 PCUs but more than 5000 PCUs. It also connects Taluka headquarters and rural areas to District headquarters within the state. As on 31 March 2016, the total length of district roads was approximately 561,940?km of which 94.93% of the total length were surfaced.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rural roads in India forms a substantial portion of the Indian road network, constituting 70.23 percent of the total roads in India (as of March 2016). As of March 2016, the percentage of surfaced rural roads to the total rural road length (excluding 9 lakh kilometres of JRY) was 66.15%.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese roads are in poor shape, affecting the rural population's quality of life and Indian farmers' ability to transfer produce to market post-harvest. Over 30 percent of Indian farmers' harvests spoil post-harvest because of the poor infrastructure. Many rural roads are of poor quality, potholed, and unable to withstand the loads of heavy farm equipment. These roads are also far from all-season, good quality 2-lane or 4-lane highways, making economic resource flow slow, and logistical costs between different parts of India one of the highest in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the development of these rural roads, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (or \\"Prime Minister Rural Roads Scheme\\"), was launched in December 2000 by the Indian government to provide connectivity to unconnected rural habitations. The scheme envisions that these roads will be constructed and maintained by the village panchayats. In some parts of India, where the government has attempted to manage it directly as a local social spending program, this program has produced limited results and no lasting change over 10 years, in either the quality or quantity of rural road network.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other parts of India, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and a sister program named Bharat Nirman (or Build India) have privatized the rural road construction projects and deployed contractors. The effort has aimed to build all-season, single lane, paved asphalted roads that connect India's rural and remote areas. A significant portion of funding for these projects has come from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.[38] This has produced results, which are presented in the table below.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2011 report, The Economist noted the rural road scheme and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee to be India's biggest single welfare project, costing over $8 billion a year. Alone, it eats up over 3% of all public spending in India. The report claims Jairam Ramesh, the minister in charge of the central government department administering the program, criticises uneven, patchy implementation of the scheme. He describes wasteful construction of items such as roads that quickly crumble away. The results, in many areas, fall short of the huge sums spent. The funds aimed to employ local villagers through their panchayats is not changing the quality of rural roads, rather ending up in wasteful spending and corrupt government officials pockets. The gloomiest estimates suggest two-thirds of allocated scheme funds is being squandered. A review published by the Ministry in September 2011 found that skilled technicians were unavailable at almost every site. There were rules banning the use of machinery or contractors, labour is usually by shovel, resulting in patchy construction of roads, drains, ponds, dams and other assets that are of very poor quality. The government scheme has failed to improve India's awful rural infrastructure. These rural roads get washed away each monsoon, only to be rebuilt, badly, the following year.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main roads in India are under huge pressure and in great need of modernisation in order to handle the increased requirements of the Indian economy. In addition to maintenance, the expansion of the network and widening of existing roads is becoming increasingly important. This would then enable the roads to handle increased traffic, and also allow for a corresponding increase in the average movement speed on India's roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, lane capacity was low and only about 16% of India's roads were four lanes or above.[8] A 2007 study found that the congestion on India's highways reduced average truck and bus speeds to 30ÿ40?km/h (19ÿ25?mph); road maintenance was under-funded, and some 40 percent of villages in India lacked access to all-weather roads.[2] While the PMGSY rural road program mentioned above has, by 2011, connected 90 percent of villages identified in 2005 as without access,[36] many remote villages in India were still without access to a single lane, paved road as of May 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intra-city vehicle speed is one of the lowest in the world. As per a study by Ola Cabs, in 2017, average traffic speed in Bengaluru was 17.2 kmph, while Delhi had the highest traffic speeds in India at 25 kmph.[40] Amongst the other major cities, the average traffic speed in Mumbai was 20.7 kmph, Kolkata (19.2 kmph), Hyderabad (18.5 kmph) and Chennai (18.9 kmph).[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Health Organization compilation of road network safety data for major economies found India to have the highest number of road fatalities in the World, with 105,000 road-accident caused deaths in 2006.[41] However, adjusted for India's larger population, the accident and fatalities rates are similar to major economies. Over 2004ÿ2007, India had a road fatality rate of 132 deaths per million citizens, compared to 131 deaths per million citizens in the United States. Non-fatal accident rates reported on Indian roads was 429 accidents per million citizens, compared to 412 accidents per million citizens in China, and 1101 accidents per million citizens in the United States. The report notes that not all accidents in India and China are reported and recorded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe low road densities per 1000 people has created significant congestion and slow speeds on existing roads inside cities. Because of the congestion, the fuel efficiency of the vehicles in India is very low. This increases the overall fuel consumption per equivalent kilometer travelled, besides resulting in heavy pollution since the engines run very inefficiently at such low speeds.[42] Pollutants from poor road network and resultant poor fuel efficiencies include hydrocarbons, NOx, SOx, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide ÿ all of which cause health problems, adverse climate effects and related environmental damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to rising prices of petroleum, a non-renewable resource, some have urged the Indian government to focus instead on improving public transport like the Indian Railways and rapid transit systems.[43] Many cities have proposed, or are implementing metros and mass transit systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's recent efforts to build modern highways and improve its road network has made a significant difference in trucking logistics. According to DHL, a global logistics company, the average time to truck shipments from New Delhi to Bengaluru (Bangalore), a 2000+ kilometre journey, had dropped in 2008, to about five days.[44] By 2010, the average time to complete a road trip from New Delhi to Mumbai, a 1400+ kilometer journey, had dropped to about 35 hours. In contrast, a similar journey takes about half the time in China, and one third in European Union countries. In a 2010 report, KPMG ÿ one of the world's largest audit and advisory services company ÿ noted marked improvements in Indian road network and logistics efficiency in recent years.[45] The report also identified the competitive challenges faced by India. Some findings of this report include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe KPMG report also notes that India's road network logistics and transportation bottlenecks hinder its GDP growth by one to two percent (US$16 billion ÿ US$32 billion). In India's 2010 per capita income basis, this is equivalent to a loss of about 10 million new jobs every year. Poor rural roads and traffic congestion inside the cities remains a challenge in India. The planned addition of over 12,000 kilometers of expressways in the next 10 years may help address some of such issues. The constraints and issues with Indian road network differ from one state to another. Some states, such as Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, have remarkably better road network than others.","input":"When was the first road built in india?"},{"output":"202,523 vehicles","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (also referred to as the Verrazano Bridge and formerly the Narrows Bridge) is a double-decked suspension bridge that connects the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn.  It spans the Narrows, a body of water linking the relatively enclosed Upper New York Bay with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The bridge carries thirteen lanes of Interstate 278 on two levels: 7 on the upper level and 6 on the lower level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineer David B. Steinman first proposed a bridge across the Narrows in 1927. Subsequent proposals of vehicular crossings across the Narrows were deferred over the next twenty years. A 1920s attempt to build a rail tunnel across the Narrows was aborted, as was another 1930s plan for vehicular tubes underneath the Narrows. Discussion of a tunnel resurfaced in the mid-1930s and early 1940s, but were again denied. In the late 1940s, urban planner Robert Moses championed a bridge across the Narrows as a way to connect Staten Island with the rest of the city. Various issues delayed the start of construction until 1959. The upper deck opened in November 21, 1964, followed by the lower deck in June 1969.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has a central span of 4,260 feet (1,298?m). It was the longest suspension bridge in the world from 1964 until it was surpassed by the Humber Bridge in the United Kingdom in 1981. The bridge has the 13th longest main span in the world, as well as the longest in the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is named for the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, who in 1524 became the first documented European explorer to enter New York Harbor and the Hudson River. Due to a mistake in naming, the bridge's name is spelled with only one \\"z\\", despite the explorer's name having two \\"z\\"s.[2] The bridge marks the gateway to New York Harbor. All ships arriving at the Port of New York and New Jersey pass underneath the bridge and must therefore be built to accommodate the clearance under it.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA bridge across the Narrows had been proposed as early as 1927, when structural engineer David B. Steinman brought up the possibility of such a crossing.[3] At the time, Staten Island was isolated from the rest of New York City, and its only direct connection to the other four boroughs was via the Staten Island Ferry to South Ferry in Manhattan, or 39th and 69th Streets in Brooklyn.[4] In 1928, when the chambers of commerce in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, and Staten Island announced that the Interboro Bridge Company had proposed the future construction of the \\"Liberty Bridge\\" to United States Department of War. The bridge's towers would be 800 feet (240?m) high and it would cost $60 million in 1928 dollars.[5]  In November 1929, engineers released plans for the 4,500-foot (1,400?m) Liberty Bridge spanning the Narrows,[6] with 800-foot-tall towers.[7]  It was hoped that the new construction would spur development on Staten Island, along with the Outerbridge Crossing and the Bayonne Bridge, which were under construction at the time.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Liberty Bridge would carry vehicles from Bay Ridge to an as-yet-undetermined location on Staten Island.[8] On the Brooklyn side, the city planned to connect the Liberty Bridge to a \\"Crosstown Highway\\", spanning Brooklyn and Queens and connecting to the proposed Triborough Bridge in northwestern Queens. The city also envisioned a possible connection to the preexisting Manhattan Bridge, connecting Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA prior attempt to link Brooklyn and Staten Island, using the Staten Island Tunnel, had commenced in 1923 but was canceled two years later.[10][11]  That tunnel would have extended subway service from Brooklyn to Staten Island.[12] This proposal was also revived with the announcement of the Liberty Bridge.[8][13] One of the alternative proposals had the subway tunnel going from St. George, Staten Island, to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, before continuing to Governors Island and then Lower Manhattan.[13] Simultaneously, engineers proposed a set of vehicular tunnels from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to 97th Street, Brooklyn.[14] The tubes were being planned in conjunction with the Triborough Tunnel (the modern-day Queens Midtown Tunnel), which would connect Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.[15] The city appropriated $5 million for the tunnels in July 1929,[16] and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also pledged funding for the vehicular tunnels.[17] Planning for the vehicular tubes started that month.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce simultaneously considered all three projectsthe bridge, the vehicular tunnels, and the subway tunnel. Community groups on both sides of the Narrows disagreed on which projects should be built first, if at all.[13] Residents of Bay Ridge opposed any plans involving a bridge because its construction would almost definitely require the demolition of part of the neighborhood.[18] Boring work for the vehicular tunnels started in November 1930. The 11,000-foot (3,400?m) twin tunnels, projected to be completed by 1937, were to connect Hylan Boulevard on Staten Island with 86th Street in Brooklyn once they were completed.[19] In January 1932, construction of these tunnels was put on hold indefinitely due to a lack of money.[20] The construction work did not go beyond an examination of shoreline on the Brooklyn side.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1933, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill authorizing the construction of a suspension bridge across the Narrows.[22] With this approval, the Interboro Bridge Company hoped to start constructing the bridge by the end of the year, thereby creating jobs for 80,000 workers.[23] Structural engineer Othmar H. Ammann, who was building the Triborough Bridge, Midtown Tunnel, and Golden Gate Bridge at the time, showed interest in designing the proposed Narrows bridge, which would be the world's longest bridge if it were built.[24] However, in April 1934, the War Department announced its opposition to the bridge's construction, setting back plans for the Narrows Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey did not have a public position regarding the Narrows Bridge plan, other than a request that it be allowed to operate the future bridge.[25] The War Department's opposition to the bridge plan was based on the fact that a bridge could create a blockage during wartime, a rationale it gave for opposing a Brooklyn-Battery Bridge connecting Red Hook, Brooklyn, with Lower Manhattan.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city approved the construction of a rapid transit tunnel under the Narrows in December 1933. This tunnel was approved in conjunction with the proposed BrooklynÿBattery Tunnel connecting Red Hook with Lower Manhattan.[27] Following the War Department's announcement that they would oppose the Narrows bridge, private interests began studying the feasibility of the tunnel.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1936, the plan for a Narrows crossing was brought up again when New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia gained authorization to petition Congress for a bridge across the Narrows.[28] Under the new plan, the proposed bridge would charge tolls for motorists, and its $50 million cost would be paid off using federal bonds.[29] LaGuardia preferred a tunnel instead, and so the next year he requested the  New York City Tunnel Authority to review the feasibility of such a crossing.[30] The New York City Planning Commission was amenable to constructing either a bridge or a tunnel across the Narrows, and in 1939, put forth a plan to expand New York City's highway system.[31][26] In March of the same year, as a bill for the Battery Bridge was being passed, Staten Island state legislators added a last-minute amendment to the bill, providing for a Narrows bridge.[32] The Narrows crossing was not included in the final version of the Planning Commission's plan, which was approved in 1941.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1943, the New York City Board of Estimate allocated $50,000 toward a feasibility study of the tunnel.[34] By this time, Bay Ridge residents now opposed the tunnel plan as well, because they feared that the tunnel's construction would lower the quality of life in that neighborhood.[35] After the war ended in 1945, the Planning Commission estimated that construction of the Narrows Tunnel would cost $73.5 million.[36] However, by then, La Guardia had turned against the tunnel, saying that \\"it is not my time\\" to construct the tunnel.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cancellation of plans for the Narrows tunnel brought a resurgence of proposals for a bridge across the Narrows. In September 1947, Robert Moses, the chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, announced that the city was going to ask the War Department for permission to build a bridge across the Narrows.[37] Moses and Mayor William O'Dwyer both supported the Narrows Bridge plan, which was still being referred to as \\"Liberty Bridge\\".[38] The city submitted its request in July 1948,[39] and a commission composed of three United States Armed Forces branches was convened to solicit the public's opinions on the proposed span.[40]\\r\\nU.S. Representative Donald Lawrence O'Toole, whose constituency included Bay Ridge, opposed the proposal for the bridge because he believed it would damage the character of Bay Ridge, and because the bridge might block the Narrows in case of a war.[41][42] He cited a poll showing that for every Bay Ridge resident who supported the bridge's construction, 33 more were opposed.[43] The  U.S. military approved the proposal in May 1949, over the vociferous opposition of Bay Ridge residents, on the condition that construction start within five years.[44][43] By that time, plans for the 6,540-foot (1,990?m) span had been finalized, and the project only needed $78 million in financing in order to proceed. This financing was not set to be awarded until 1950, when the Battery Tunnel was completed. Preliminary plans showed the bridge as being 237 feet (72?m) above the mean high water level, enough for the 215-foot (66?m) RMS Queen Mary to pass under it.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses and acting Port Authority Chairman Bayard F. Pope were agreeable to letting either of their respective agencies construct and operate the proposed Narrows Bridge, as long as that agency could do so efficiently. In 1954, the two agencies started conducting a joint study on the logistics of building and constructing the bridge. Because of restrictions by the TBTA's bondholders, construction could not begin until at least 1957.[46] Frederick H. Zurmuhlen, the Commissioner of Public Works, estimated that the Narrows Bridge would cost $200 million total.[47] He encouraged the TBTA to start construction on the bridge as soon as possible in order to reduce congestion on East River crossings to the north.[48] Staten Islanders viewed the project cautiously, since the Narrows Bridge would provide a connection to the rest of the city, but could also cause traffic congestion through the borough.[49] Moses had only a positive view of the bridge's proposed effects on Staten Islanders, saying that it was vital for the borough's future.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1954, the Army's permit for starting construction on the Narrows Bridge lapsed.[51] The Army granted a two-year extension for the start of construction.[52] In a measure passed in March 1955, the city gained control over the approval process for several tasks related to the Narrows bridge's construction, including land acquisition.[53] A little more than a month later, New York Governor W. Averell Harriman signed a $600 million spending bill authorizing the construction of the Narrows Bridge; the construction of the Throgs Neck Bridge between Queens and the Bronx; and the addition of a second level to the George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey.[54] Later that year, it was announced that the Narrows Bridge would be part of an expansion to the Interstate Highway System.[55] Although a study on the viability of adding transit service to the Narrows Bridge was commissioned in early 1956,[56] Moses rejected the idea of adding subway tracks onto the new bridge, saying that it would be too costly.[57] In April of that year, New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner signed a bill that allowed the Port Authority to build the Narrows Bridge and lease it to the TBTA, who would operate the bridge.[58] The TBTA would buy the bridge from the Port Authority in 1967 as part of the agreement.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Brooklyn side, the Narrows Bridge was originally supposed to connect to the Circumferential (Belt) Parkway, but in early 1957, Harriman vetoed a bill that stipulated that the main approach connect to the Belt Parkway.[60] By May 1957, an updated location for the Brooklyn anchorage had been agreed on. The anchorage was now to be located at Fort Lafayette, an island coastal fortification built next to Fort Hamilton at the southern tip of Bay Ridge.[61] Moses also proposed expanding Brooklyn's Gowanus Expressway and extending it to the Narrows Bridge by way of Seventh Avenue, which would require cutting through the middle of Bay Ridge. This proposal drew opposition from the community, who wanted the approach to follow the Belt Parkway along the Brooklyn shore.[62] These opponents said that the Seventh Avenue alignment would displace over 1,500 families.[63]  In February 1958, the New York State Legislature approved a bill to change the Brooklyn approaches back to Belt Parkway, which was almost identical to the bill Harriman had vetoed.[64] However, the city approved the Seventh Avenue bridge approach in August 1958.[65] The next month, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. said that the city was committed to building a bridge across the Narrows, but was not committed to the construction of the Seventh Avenue approach. In response, Moses wrote to Wagner that any continuing delays would cause the bridge to be canceled. The bridge's cost had now risen to $320 million.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter holding a hearing for concerned Bay Ridge residents, the Board of Estimate affirmed the Narrows Bridge plan in October 1958,[63] without any objections.[67]:752 At the same time, it rejected plans for a tunnel under the Narrows, as well as a bridge or tunnel from Brooklyn directly to Jersey City, New Jersey.[63] The Board was set to vote on the Seventh Avenue approach in mid-December, but the federal government stated that it would only agree to the bridge's construction if the Seventh Avenue approach had 12 lanes, with six on each level.[68] The federal government was already paying for two highway improvements on both sides of the proposed bridge: the Clove Lakes Expressway on Staten Island, and the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn.[63] On December 31 of that year, the Board of Estimate voted to approve plans for the Seventh Avenue approach, having delayed that vote several times.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe approval of the Seventh Avenue approach angered Bay Ridge residents since the construction of the approach would displace 7,500 people.[70] This amount of opposition was not matched in Staten Island, even though more than twice as many people were being displaced there, because the Staten Island Ferry was the only way to get between the island and the rest of the city. On the contrary, the bridge's announcement was welcomed because it sparked a rise in real-estate prices on the island.[71]:18ÿ20 The State Legislature drafted a bill in an effort to change the approach's location to Belt Parkway.[72] However, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller vetoed the Belt Parkway bill,[73] and in March 1959, the Board of Estimate officially condemned land along Seventh Avenue to make way for the Gowanus Expressway extension to the Narrows Bridge.[74] The only tasks remaining before the start of construction were to finalize the design of the Narrows Bridge, and to speed up the construction schedule to meet a 1964 deadline.[75] In April 1959, the bridge was officially renamed after the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano.[76] This sparked a controversy because the proposed bridge's name only had one \\"z\\" while the explorer's name had two \\"z\\"s.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nSurveying work for the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge began in January 1959.[71]:29 The official construction on the bridge began on August 14, 1959, with a groundbreaking ceremony on the Staten Island anchorage. Those in attendance included New Jersey Governor Meyner, New York City Mayor Wagner, and TBTA Chairman Moses. Although New York Governor Rockefeller had been invited to the event, neither he nor Assembly Speaker Joseph F. Carlino showed up.[59][71]:30 In December 1959, the TBTA was put in charge of funding and building the bridge.[78]  To raise money for construction, Rockefeller signed a bill that would remove the 4% ceiling on the interest rates for the securities that the TBTA was selling to pay for the bridge. This ceiling would be lifted until June 1965. In essence, this meant that the TBTA could sell securities at much higher interest rates to raise the $320 million that was needed.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swiss-born engineer Othmar Ammann was named as the senior partner for the project.[59] Other notable figures involved chief engineer Milton Brumer;[80][81] project engineers Herb Rothman and Frank L. Stahl;[82] design engineer Leopold Just;[83] Safety Engineer Alonzo Dickinson,[84] and engineer of construction John West Kinney.[82] Meanwhile, John \\"Hard Nose\\" Murphy supervised the span's and cables' construction.[71]:52[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore starting actual work on the bridge, the TBTA destroyed the structures at the future locations of the anchorages.[59] The agency acquired 36 acres (15?ha) of the 138 acres (56?ha) within Fort Hamilton, in return for paying for a $12 million renovation of the Army installation and giving up 10.8 acres (4.4?ha) of land in Dyker Beach Park.[86] A 1,000-ton World War I monument on the Brooklyn side, within the path of the future Seventh Avenue approach, was placed atop rolling logs and shifted 370 feet (110?m).[87] The right-of-way for the Seventh Avenue approach was also being cleared, and despite initial opposition to the clearing work, all of the residents within the approach's path eventually acquiesced to moving elsewhere.[71]:24 To prevent contractors from delaying work on the expressways on either side of the bridge, Moses warned them of steep fines if the expressways were not completed by the time the bridge was finished.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn anchorage was built on each side of the Narrows, with each anchorage measuring 229 feet (70?m) long by 129 feet (39?m) wide, with sixty-six large holes for the cables.[71]:54[89] Foundation work for the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was well underway by 1960, as visitors were able to see the anchorages.[90]  Then, two caissons were sunk into the channel close to either shoreline. The Staten Island side's caisson was sunk 105 feet (32?m) into the water, and necessitated the dredging of 81,000 cubic yards (62,000?m3) of sand and assorted muck.[71]:54 This caisson required 47,000 cubic yards (36,000?m3) of concrete, and in March 1961, it became the first of the two caissons to be sunk.[89] The Brooklyn side's caisson required even more work, since it was 170 feet (52?m) deep, displaced 145,000 cubic yards (111,000?m3) of muck, and used 83,000 cubic yards (63,000?m3) of concrete.[71]:54[89] A concrete workers' strike in mid-1961 threatened the timely completion of the Staten Island anchorage, which had only been partially filled with concrete.[91] This strike lasted several months and affected many projects under the city.[92] The process of constructing the anchorages and caissons took just over two years, and it was complete by the end of 1961.[71]:54\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterward, two separate companies constructed the modules that would make up the 693-foot-tall (211?m) suspension towers. The Staten Island tower was built  by Bethlehem Steel, and the Brooklyn tower was built by the Harris Structural Company.[71]:55 The first piece of the towers, a 300-foot piece of the tower on the Staten Island side, was lifted into place in October 1961,[93] and this tower was topped out by September 1962.[94] The Brooklyn tower started construction in April 1962.[95] When the towers were fully erected, workers began the process of spinning the bridge's cables. The American Bridge Company was selected to construct the cables and deck.[71]:53 The cable-spinning process began in March 1963 and took six months, since 142,520 miles (229,360?km) of bridge cables had to be strung 104,432 times around the bridge.[96] The main cables were hung on both sides of the span, and then suspender cables were hung from the bridge's main cables.[71]:58 The main cables were fully spun by August.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1963, builders started receiving the rectangular pieces that would make up the roadway deck. The components for the sixty 40-ton slabs were first created in an assembly line in Jersey City.[98] Then, these components were combined in a Bayonne steelworks 5 miles (8.0?km) from the bridge site, and after the pieces of each slab were assembled, they were floated to the Narrows via barge.[99] Each piece measured 28 feet (8.5?m) high by approximately 115 feet (35?m) wide and long. These pieces of the deck were then hung from the suspender cables.[71]:94ÿ95 The first piece of the deck was lifted onto the bridge in October 1963.[100] By early 1964, the span was nearly finished, and all that remained was to secure the various parts of the bridge.[71]:133 By this point, plans for new development on Staten Island were well underway,[101] and tourists had come to observe the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.[102] The bridge had been scheduled to open in 1965, but owing to the faster-than-anticipated rate of progress, the TBTA decided to open the bridge in November 1964.[103] In preparation for the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge's opening, the TBTA fully repainted the structure.[104] The construction process of the bridge had employed an average of 1,200 workers a day for five years, excluding those who had worked on the approaches; around 10,000 individuals had worked on the bridge throughout that five-year period.[67]:736\\r\\n\\r\\nThree men died during the construction of the bridge.[71]:91 The first fatality was 58-year-old Paul Bassett, who fell off the deck and struck a tower in August 1962.[105] Irving Rubin, also 58 years old, died in July 1963 when he fell off of the bridge approach.[106][71]:91 The third worker who died was 19-year-old Gerard McKee, who fell into the water in October 1963 after slipping off the catwalk.[71]:91[107][108] After McKee's death, workers participated in a five-day strike in December 1963. The strike resulted in temporary safety nets being installed underneath the deck.[71]:98[109][110] These nets had not been provided during the four years prior to the strike.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction of the bridge was chronicled by the writer Gay Talese in his 1964 book The Bridge: The Building of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. He also wrote several articles about the bridge's construction for the New York Times.[111] The book also contains several drawings by Lili Rthi and photographs by Bruce Davidson.[71]:Cover Page\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Staten Island approach to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was the first part of the new project to be completed, and it opened in January 1964.[112] The upper deck was opened on November 21, 1964, at a cost of $320?million in 1964 dollars, equivalent to $2,525?million in present dollars.[113] Politicians at all levels of the government, from Brooklyn Borough President Abe Stark to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, wrote speeches paying tribute to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.[114] The opening ceremony was attended by over 5,000 people, including 1,500 official guests. Several dignitaries, involving the mayor, the governor, and the borough presidents of Brooklyn and Staten Island, cut the gold ribbon. They then joined a motorcade to mark the official opening of the bridge. A 35-cent toll was charged to all motorists crossing the bridge.[115][113] The Verrazano Bridge's opening was celebrated across Staten Island.[116] Moses did not invite any of the 12,000 workers to the opening,[110] so they boycotted the event and instead attended a mass in memory of the three workers who died during construction.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening was accompanied by the release of a commemorative postage stamp, which depicted a ship sailing underneath the new span.[117] The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) created a bus route across the bridge to connect Victory Boulevard in Staten Island with the Bay Ridgeÿ95th Street subway station in Brooklyn.[118] This bus service initially saw low patronage, with only 6,000 daily passengers using the route.[119] Five days after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, the ferry from Staten Island to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, stopped running, as it was now redundant to the new bridge.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the first two months of the bridge's opening, 1.86 million vehicles had used the new crossing, ten percent more than originally projected, and this netted the TBTA almost $1 million in toll revenue. The Goethals Bridge, which connected New Jersey to the Staten Island Expressway and the Verrazano Bridge, saw its daily average use increase by 75%, or approximately 300,000 trips total, compared to before the Narrows Bridge opened. The Holland Tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan, and the Staten Island Ferry from Staten Island to Manhattan, both saw decreased vehicle counts after the bridge opened.[121] In summer 1965, Staten Island saw increased patronage at its beaches, facilitated by the opening of the new bridge.[122] By the time of the bridge's first anniversary, 17 million motorists had crossed the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, paying $9 million in tolls.[123] The bridge had seen 34% more trips than planners had projected.[124] Conversely, 5.5 million fewer passengers and 700,000 fewer vehicles rode the Staten Island Ferry to Manhattan.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verrazano Bridge was the last project designed by Ammann, who had designed many of the other major crossings into and within New York City. He died in 1965, the year after the bridge opened.[126] The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was also the last great public works project in New York City overseen by Moses.[127] The urban planner envisioned that the Verrazano and Throgs Neck Bridges would be the final major bridges in New York City for the time being, since they would complete the city's expressway system.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the bridge was constructed with only one 6-lane roadway, Ammann had made provisions for a second 6-lane deck below it, in the form of extra trusses.[129] These trusses, which were used to strengthen the bridge, were a design alteration that was added to many bridges in the aftermath of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse in 1940.[71]:45 The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge became so popular among motorists that in March 1969, the TBTA decided to erect the lower deck[130] at a cost of $22 million.[67]:1130 The Verrazano Bridge had not been expected to carry enough traffic to necessitate a second deck until 1978, but traffic patterns over the previous five years had demonstrate the need for extra bridge capacity. By contrast, a lower deck on the George Washington Bridge, connecting New Jersey and Upper Manhattan, had not been built until thirty-one years after the bridge's 1931 opening.[131] The new six-lane deck opened on June 28, 1969.[132] Originally, the Verrazano Bridge's Brooklyn end was also supposed to connect to the planned Cross-Brooklyn Expressway, New York State Route 878, and JFK Airport, but the Cross-Brooklyn Expressway project was canceled in 1969.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 26, 1976, to celebrate the United States' 200th anniversary, workers placed a very large U.S. flag on the side of the Verrazano Bridge. The flag was described as having the area of \\"a football field and a half\\"[134] and billed as the world's largest flag,[135] and at the time, it was the largest U.S. flag ever made.[110] The flag was supposed to withstand wind speeds of 30 miles per hour (48?km/h), but it ripped apart three days later, when there was a wind speed of 16 miles per hour (26?km/h).[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TBTA's successor, MTA Bridges and Tunnels, stopped collecting tolls for Brooklyn-bound drivers in 1986, and doubled the toll for Staten Island-bound drivers.[136] This was a result of a bill introduced by Guy V. Molinari, the U.S. Representative for Staten Island, as part of an initiative to reduce traffic that accumulated at the toll booth on Staten Island.[137] The one-way toll was initially intended to be part of a six-month pilot program,[138] but resulted in permanent changes to traffic flows on the Verrazano Bridge. The crossing saw more Brooklyn-bound traffic and less Staten Island-bound traffic as a result.[139] This unidirectional collection is still in effect as of  March 2017[update].[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2008, all 262 of the mercury vapor fixtures in the bridge's necklace lighting were replaced with energy-efficient light-emitting diodes. This retrofit was completed in 2009, years before LED street lights were installed in the rest of the city.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the city began a $1.5 billion reconstruction project on the bridge. At the time, it was expected to take up to 25 years.[142] The first phase, which cost $235 million and lasted until 2017, included replacing ramps, removing the divider on the upper deck, and adding a seventh lane on the upper deck, which was to be used as a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane.[143] The parts for this deck were ordered from China because the parts that the MTA required were no longer manufactured in the United States.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the upper deck was replaced, parts of the lower deck are to be replaced, but this necessitates the closure of the lower deck during construction. Hence, the MTA opted to replace the upper deck first to add more capacity. The Brooklyn ramps to the bridge are also being rebuilt.[142] The upper level's new HOV lane opened in July 2017.[145] Simultaneously, the MTA dismantled the Staten Island-bound toll booths to speed up westbound traffic.[146] This work was done in advance of the reconstruction of tracks around Penn Station, which severely limited rail service into that station and created more vehicular traffic at crossings to Manhattan.[147] Eventually, the Verrazano Bridge might also contain a bicycle and pedestrian path.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is owned by Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority bondholders who paid for the bridge at its construction.[149] It is operated by the TBTA's successor, MTA Bridges and Tunnels, which is an affiliate agency of the MTA.[150] The bridge carries Interstate?278, which continues onto the Staten Island Expressway to the west and the Gowanus Expressway to the northeast. The Verrazano, in combination with the Goethals Bridge and the Staten Island Expressway, created a new way for commuters and travelers to reach Brooklyn, Long Island, and Manhattan by car from New Jersey.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the two towers contains 1?million bolts and 3?million rivets.[2] The diameters of each of the four main suspension cables is 36 inches (914?mm). Each main cable is composed of 26,108 wires amounting to a total of 142,520 miles (229,364?km) in length.[2][96] Because of the height of the towers (693?ft or 211?m) and their distance apart (4,260?ft or 1,298?m), the curvature of the Earth's surface had to be taken into account when designing the bridgethe towers are 1?5?8 inches (41.275?mm) farther apart at their tops than at their bases; they are not parallel to each other.[67]:752[2][152] The bridge's two towers are the tallest structures in New York City outside of Manhattan.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of opening, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world, with a center span of 4,260 feet (1,300?m), surpassing the length of the Golden Gate Bridge's center span by 60 feet (18?m).[71]:5 In 1981, it was surpassed by the Humber Bridge in England, which has a center span of 4,626 feet (1,410?m).[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of thermal expansion of the steel cables, the bridge roadway is 12 feet (3.66?m) lower in summer than in winter.[2][110][154] The bridge is affected by weather more than any other bridge in the city because of its size and isolated location close to the open ocean; it is occasionally closed, either partially or entirely, during strong wind and snow storms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Narrows is the only entry point for cruise ships and container ships that dock in New York City. As a result, they must be built to accommodate the clearance under the bridge. At mean high water, that clearance is 228 feet (69?m).[81] The RMS Queen Mary?2, one such vessel built to Verrazano-Narrows Bridge specifications, was designed with a flatter funnel to pass under the bridge, and has 13 feet (3.96?m) of clearance under the bridge during high tide.[2][155]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous birds nest or roost on the bridge, most notably breeding peregrine falcons.[156] The falcons nest at the top of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge's towers, as well as on the Throgs Neck and Marine Parkway Bridges. As the falcons are endangered, the city places bands on each bird and examines the birds' nesting sites each year. The falcons were discovered on the top of the Verrazano Bridge in 1983, though they had been breeding there for several years prior.[157][158]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the planning stages, the bridge was originally named simply the \\"Narrows Bridge\\".[159] The co-naming of the bridge for Verrazzano (with two \\"z\\"s) was controversial. It was first proposed in 1951 by the Italian Historical Society of America, when the bridge was in the planning stage. After Robert Moses turned down the initial proposal, the society undertook a public relations campaign to re-establish Verrazzano's largely forgotten reputation and to promote the idea of naming the bridge for him. The society's director, John N. LaCorte, successfully lobbied several governors of states along the U.S.'s East Coast to proclaim April 17, the anniversary of Verrazzano's arrival in the harbor, as Verrazzano Day. LaCorte then approached the TBTA again, but was turned down a second time. The manager of the authority, backed by Moses, said the name was too long and that he had never heard of Verrazzano.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian Historical Society later succeeded in lobbying to get a bill introduced in the New York State Assembly that would name the bridge for the explorer. After the introduction of the bill, the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce joined the society in promoting the name. In April 1958, Governor W. Averell Harriman announced that he would propose naming the Narrows Bridge after Verrazzano in honor of the explorer's voyage to the New York Harbor in 1524.[161] His successor, Nelson Rockefeller put his support behind the one-\\"z\\" \\"Verrazano\\" name in April 1959, saying that it was the Americans' standard way of spelling the explorer's name.[76] Although the \\"Verrazano\\" name was not finalized yet, the New York Times noted that the Staten Island Ferry boat carrying dignitaries to the bridge's August 1959 groundbreaking ceremony was named the \\"Verrazzano\\". The Times further stated that former Governor Harriman and Mayor Wagner had respectively proposed a \\"Verrazzano Bridge\\" and proclaimed a \\"Verrazzano Day\\".[77] The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce opposed the Verrazano name altogether, saying that the proper name of the bridge should be \\"Staten Island Bridge\\" because there was also a \\"Brooklyn Bridge\\", a \\"Manhattan Bridge\\", a \\"Queens Bridge\\", and a \\"Bronx Bridge\\".[162] The Italian Historical Society was reportedly perplexed about the opposition to the \\"Verrazano\\" name.[163] In response to the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce's opposition, the TBTA offered to add a hyphen between \\"Verrazano\\" and \\"Narrows\\".[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nRockefeller signed the \\"Verrazano\\" name into law in March 1960, which officially changed the name of the Narrows Bridge to \\"Verrazano-Narrows Bridge\\".[164] The naming issue did not encounter any more controversy until 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This prompted a series of suggestions to rename structures, monuments, and agencies across the United States after the late president.[165] A petition to rename the Verrazano Bridge for Kennedy received thousands of signatures.[166] In response, LaCorte contacted the president's brother, United States Attorney General Robert Kennedy, who told LaCorte that he would assure that the bridge would keep the \\"Verrazano\\" name.[160] Ultimately, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge kept its name, while Idlewild Airport in Queens was renamed after Kennedy.[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn part due to discrimination against Italian-Americans, the bridge's official name was widely ignored by local news outlets at the time of the dedication. Some radio announcers and newspapers omitted any reference to Verrazzano, referring to the bridge as the Narrows Bridge, or the BrooklynÿStaten Island Bridge. The society continued its lobbying efforts to promote the name in the following years until the name became firmly established. Another ethnic slur for bridge was its nickname as the \\"Guinea Gangplank\\", referring to the Italian-Americans who subsequently moved from Brooklyn to Staten Island.[71]:33\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2016, St. Francis College student Robert Nash[168] started a petition to correctly spell Giovanni da Verrazzano's name on the bridge. The petition has gained support from politicians including Senator Martin Golden and Senator Andrew Lanza. The petition has also been supported by actors and celebrities Robert DeNiro, Tony Gemignani, and Joe D'Onofrio.[169] The results of the petition are ongoing.[170][171][172] In December 2016, Senators Golden and Lanza sent letters to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority CEO Thomas F. Prendergast, in which they recommended that the bridge's name be spelled correctly. An MTA spokesperson said the agency was reviewing the letter.[169][173]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of March 19, 2017, drivers pay the one-way toll (paid westbound into Staten Island only) $17.00 per car or $7.00 per motorcycle. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E ZPass Customer Service Center pay $11.52 per car or $5.00 per motorcycle; a five-axle truck pays $92, or $56.80 with NY E-ZPass. There is a Staten Island Resident Program that provides a discounted rate of $5.50 to registered residents of Staten Island using E-ZPass. Holders of transponders issued elsewhere get no discount. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass Customer Service Center are required to pay the Toll-by-mail rates.[140] The $17 tolls for passenger cars, imposed in 2017, were higher than for most other tolled crossings in the U.S. Tolls for trucks ranged up to $132, or $79.52 with E-ZPass depending on the number of axles. As of  2017[update], the tolls from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge grossed the MTA $417 million per year, and about 85% of bridge motorists use the discounted toll rate.[174]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn urban legend has it that tolls were to be abolished once the bridge's construction bonds were paid off, but this has been debunked by the Staten Island Advance.[175][176] Originally, all drivers paid the same standard toll to cross the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, regardless of whether they were Staten Island residents. They were the only residents of New York City who had to pay a toll in order to enter their home borough, since all four of Staten Island's vehicular crossings collected tolls. This put Staten Island motorists at a financial disadvantage compared to drivers who lived in other boroughs.[177][178][174] A bill to reduce the tolls for Staten Islanders was introduced in the New York City Council in 1975.[177] Governor Mario Cuomo signed another law to give Staten Island residents discounted tolls in 1983, after years of petitioning and opposition from his two predecessors.[178]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom its opening until 1986, the toll was collected in both directions.  In 1985, U.S. Representative Guy V. Molinari co-sponsored a bill that would require the MTA to collect the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge's toll in the Staten Island-bound direction only. This came after Staten Island residents had complained about pollution from idling vehicles.[137] In December of that year, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that prohibited the MTA from collecting tolls from Brooklyn-bound vehicles,[179] under penalty of a loss of highway funding.[139] Accordingly, in March 1986, the MTA started a pilot program where it charged a $3.50 toll for Staten Island-bound vehicles rather than charging a $1.75 toll in both directions.[136][180] The pilot program was extended to six months, but it was controversial due to the dubious benefits involved.[138] The new toll plan not only caused a drop in revenues,[181] but also caused congestion in Manhattan and Brooklyn[182] and air pollution in Manhattan. Canal Street in Lower Manhattan, which connected to the Holland Tunnel to New Jersey, saw the most severe congestion, as drivers would go through New Jersey and use the Bayonne Bridge to pay a cheaper toll to enter Staten Island.[183] Fatal accidents involving pedestrians in Lower Manhattan also increased greatly as a result.[184] In 1987, the MTA supported removing the one-way toll because it reduced MTA revenues by $7 million a year.[185] At that point, Cuomo proposed reinstating an eastbound toll for trucks.[186] In 1990, it was noted that about 455,000 more eastbound vehicles per year were using the bridge's eastbound lanes compared to before the toll reconfiguration, but that this was heavily outweighed by the 1.5 million fewer westbound vehicles per year.[139] Residents of Manhattan and Brooklyn wanted the tolls changed so that either eastbound vehicles only, or both directions, would be tolled.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite not collecting tolls in the eastbound direction since 1986, the MTA did not do anything with the unused booths for a quarter-century.[188] In 2010, eight of the eleven Brooklyn-bound toll booths were removed as part of the first phase of a project to improve traffic flow at the toll plaza.[189][188] Two years later, the last of the eastbound tollbooths was removed.[190][191] To this day, tolls are still collected only in the Staten Island-bound direction, and congestion within Lower Manhattan persists due to the bridge's one-way westbound toll.[140][174]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen-road cashless tolling began on July 8, 2017.[146] The westbound tollbooths were also dismantled, and drivers were no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries near where the booths were located.[192][193] Drivers without E-ZPass will have a picture of their license plate taken, and the toll will be mailed to them. For E-ZPass users, sensors will detect their transponders wirelessly.[192][193]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, an average of 202,523 vehicles used the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge daily in both directions. As of  2015[update], the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge carries more traffic than the Outerbridge Crossing, the Bayonne Bridge, and the Goethals Bridge. These three bridges, which connect Staten Island with New Jersey, were used by a combined  168,984 vehicles in both directions.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Transportation for America rated the bridge as New York's most dangerous, because of the combination of deterioration and the amount of people who cross it per day.[194] The MTA responded that the bridge, which was the state's newest large bridge and its longest, was structurally sound, and that the bridge had passed its most recent inspection. The MTA attributed Transportation for America's results to a \\"misinterpretation of inspection records\\".[195]\\r\\n\\r\\nSigns at both ends of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge forbid photography and video taping while on the bridge. These signs were installed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when the MTA started taking away film from individuals who were caught filming MTA crossings. However, the ban had been in place long before the attacks in order to prevent people from taking close-up pictures of the bridge.[196]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree local bus routes operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations use the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge: the S53 local route, the S79 Select Bus Service route, and the S93 limited-stop route. The bridge also carries 17 express bus routes that connect Staten Island with Manhattan and are also operated by New York City Transit. They are the X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X7, X8, X9, X10, X11, X12, X14, X15, X17, X19, X31, and X42.[197]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubway tracks were proposed for the bridge early in the planning process,[56] but Moses rejected them over cost concerns.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was not built with a pedestrian walkway, due to concerns over cost, as well as an effort to prevent possible suicide jumps.[198] Non-motorized transportation is limited to using the bridge during the New York City Marathon and Five Boro Bike Tour.[199][200] In 1976, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was designated as the starting point of the New York City Marathon. The 1976 marathon was the first year in the marathon's six-year history that the New York City Marathon course went outside Manhattan.[201] Since then, the marathon has started at the Verrazano Bridge's Staten island end every year.[202] The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is not open to pedestrians or bikers outside of the marathon and the bike tour.[199]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lack of a walkway did not stop suicides completely, since by 1975, four people had died after jumping off the bridge.[203] The number of suicides has increased over time, despite efforts at deterrence. A sign that says \\"Life Is Worth Living\\" is located on the Staten Island approach. In 2008, the MTA also installed six suicide hotlines on the bridge.[204]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been calls for a walkway or bike lane on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge since its opening, when several people protested over the lack of bike lanes at the bridge's opening ceremony.[205] In 1977, as a temporary solution, the city modified three buses to fit 12 bikes and 20 passengers each, then operated these buses on a new \\"S7 Verrazano Bridge\\" route.[206] In 1993, the New York City Department of City Planning called for a footpath across the bridge as part of their Greenway Plan for New York City.[207] The next year, the city sought a $100,000 federal grant to fund a feasibility study into a Verrazano Bridge pedestrian and bike path.[208] In 1997, the DCP released its study, which found that two footpaths running between the suspender ropes along the upper level, separated for pedestrian and cyclist use, would cost a minimum of $26.5 million.[209][210] The MTA at the time expressed concern about the \\"safety and liability inherent in any strategy that introduces pedestrian and bicycle access\\" to the bridge.[209]\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal residents on both side of the bridge started advocating for the construction of a walkway or bikeway on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 2002. Dave Lutz, the director of the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition nonprofit, stated that after the September 11 attacks, Staten Islanders walked home along the bridge's roadway.[211] Mayor Michael Bloomberg promised to look into the possibility in October 2003.[212]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Harbor Ring Committee was formed in 2011 to advocate for the completion of the Harbor Ring route, which would create a 50-mile (80?km) around New York Harbor, including a footpath across the Verrazano.[210] In spring 2013 the committee began an online petition that generated more than 2,500 signatures, as well as an organizational sign-on letter with the support of 16 regional and local advocacy and planning organizations.[213]  That year, the MTA announced that it would include conduct a three-year feasibility study for installing a pathway on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.[210][214] The MTA considered plans for a bike lane in 2015, during the reconstruction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.[148]","input":"How many cars drive over the verrazano bridge?"},{"output":"sugar","context":"Triangular trade or triangle trade is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has export commodities that are not required in the region from which its major imports come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying trade imbalances between the above regions.\\r\\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of winds and currents during the age of sail. For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going south of 30 N latitude and reaching the so-called \\"trade winds\\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the North American mainland. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the Gulf Stream in a northeasterly direction using the westerlies. A similar triangle to this, called the volta do mar was already being used by the Portuguese, before Christopher Columbus' voyage, to sail to the Canary Islands and the Azores. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic slave trade, that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between West Africa, Caribbean or American colonies and the European colonial powers, with the northern colonies of British North America, especially New England, sometimes taking over the role of Europe.[1] The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial cash crops, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the sea lane west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called Middle Passage.[2]\\r\\nA classic example is the colonial molasses trade. Sugar (often in its liquid form, molasses) from the Caribbean was traded to Europe or New England, where it was distilled into rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase manufactured goods, which were then shipped to West Africa, where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar, which was shipped to Europe, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\\r\\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as copper, cloth, trinkets, slave beads, guns and ammunition.[3] When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the Middle Passage from Africa to the New World. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the slave ships. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,[4] from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from Virginia, tobacco and hemp. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.\\r\\nHowever, because of several disadvantages that slave ships faced compared to other trade ships, they often returned to their home port carrying whatever goods were readily available in the Americas and filled up a large part or all of their capacity with ballast. Other disadvantages include the different form of the ships (to carry as many humans as possible, but not ideal to carry a maximum amount of produce) and the variations in the duration of a slave voyage, making it practically impossible to pre-schedule appointments in the Americas, which meant that slave ships often arrived in the Americas out-of-season. When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage. Due to the slaves being transported in tight, confined spaces, a small percentage of the group that started perished at the hands of disease and lack of nourishment.[5] Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back mitigating the impact the slaves involvement brought forth. The Triangular trade is a trade model, not an exact description of the ship's route.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2017 study provides evidence for the hypothesis that the export of gunpowder technology to Africa increased the transatlantic slave trade by making it easier for Africans to enslave each other: \\"A one percent increase in gunpowder set in motion a 5-year gun-slave cycle that increased slave exports by an average of 50%, and the impact continued to grow over time.\\"[7]\\r\\nNew England also benefited from the trade, as many merchants from New England, especially the state of Rhode Island, replaced the role of Europe in the triangle. New England also made rum from the Caribbean sugar and molasses, which it shipped to Africa as well as within the New World.[8] Yet, the \\"triangle trade\\" as considered in relation to New England was a piecemeal operation. No New England traders are known to have completed a sequential circuit of the full triangle, which took a calendar year on average, according to historian Clifford Shipton.[9] The concept of the New England Triangular trade was first suggested, inconclusively, in an 1866 book by George H. Moore, was picked up in 1872 by historian George C. Mason, and reached full consideration from a lecture in 1887 by American businessman and historian William B. Weeden.[10] The song \\"Molasses to Rum\\" from the musical 1776 vividly describes this form of the triangular trade.\\r\\nThe term \\"triangular trade\\" also refers to a variety of other trades.","input":"What did the european export from the caribbean?"},{"output":"Richard Crispin Armitage","context":"Richard Crispin Armitage (born 22 August 1971) is an English film, television, theatre and voice actor. He received notice in the UK with his first leading role as John Thornton in the British television programme North & South (2004).[1] But it was his role as dwarf prince and leader Thorin Oakenshield in Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation of The Hobbit[2] that first brought him international recognition. Other notable roles include John Proctor in Ya?l Farbers stage production of Arthur Miller's The Crucible, Francis Dolarhyde in the American TV series Hannibal,[3] Lucas North in the British TV drama Spooks,[4] John Porter in the British TV drama Strike Back,[5] and Guy of Gisborne in the British TV drama Robin Hood.[4] He more recently voiced Trevor Belmont in the Netflix adaptation of Castlevania.\\r\\nAfter graduating from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), Armitage initially sought theatre work and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). He turned to film and television roles when he noticed that leading stage roles went to actors with name recognition who could bring in patrons to fill venues. After twelve years away and having earned that name recognition, Armitage returned to the stage in 2014 taking his first leading role in a major production. He played John Proctor in the highly successful and critically acclaimed production of The Crucible at The Old Vic,[6][7] and earned an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor.[8]\\r\\nOne of Armitage's trademarks is his baritone voice, which he has employed as a voice actor since 2006. While working on the TV series Robin Hood, he was asked to record audiobooks for the first season of that series. Since then, Armitage has recorded many notable audiobooks and has worked as a narrator on many TV and radio shows and adverts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArmitage was born in Leicester, England, the younger son of Margaret, a secretary, and John Armitage, an engineer. Richard has an older brother named Chris.[9] He attended Huncote Community Primary School in Huncote, Blaby District, Leicestershire and began secondary school at the local comprehensive school, Brockington College in Enderby.\\r\\nAt Brockington, Armitage pursued his interest in music - playing the cello in school and local orchestras, and learning how to play the flute. By fourteen, having secured a grant from the Leicestershire Authority, he successfully persuaded his mother to allow him to transfer to Pattison College in Coventry, an independent boarding school specialising in the Performing Arts so that he could focus on drama and dance.[10][11][12]\\r\\nArmitage has expressed gratitude for the lessons and opportunities Pattison College provided, saying \\"It...instilled me with a discipline that has stood me in good stead - never to be late, to know your lines and to be professional.\\"[13] By the time he finished school, he had achieved A Levels in music and English,[14] and acting experience in local amateur and professional productions such as Showboat, Half a Sixpence, Orpheus and the Underworld (as Bacchus) and The Hobbit (as an elf) at the New Alexandra Theatre (aka \\"The Alex\\"), Birmingham.[13]\\r\\nAfter completing the programme at Pattison College in 1988, Armitage joined the Nachtcircus in Budapest for six months to obtain his Equity Card, a requirement at the time for entertainment professionals to work in the UK.[15][16] Returning to England, he pursued a career in musical theatre ÿ working as an assistant choreographer to Kenn Oldfield and performing in various productions, including the ensembles of 42nd Street, My One and Only, Nine, Annie Get Your Gun and as Admetus and Macavity in Cats.[17] Armitage was also pursuing acting in dramatic theatre productions, including The Real Thing, Six Degrees of Separation and Death of a Salesman.\\r\\nBy 1992, he began to doubt if musical theatre was the right career path, so he enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) in 1993 to further study acting.[18][19] \\"I needed to do something a bit more truthful than musical theatre. For me it was a bit too theatrical and all about standing on stage and showing off. I was looking for something else, so thats why I went back to drama school.\\"[20]\\r\\nAfter completing LAMDA's three-year programme, he returned to the stage as a supporting player with the Royal Shakespeare Company's productions of Macbeth and The Duchess of Malfi, as well as Hamlet and Four Alice Bakers with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre while taking a series of small roles in television and films.[21] In 2002 he starred in the Charm Offensive's production of Use Me As Your Cardigan.[22]\\r\\nThat same year Armitage appeared in his first major television role, as John Standring in the BBC drama Sparkhouse (2002).[23] \\"It was the first time I went to an audition in character. It was a minor role but it was something I really got my teeth into... I couldn't go back. I knew I had to approach everything the same way.\\"[24] After this he took supporting roles in the TV productions of Between the Sheets,[25] Cold Feet (series 5),[26] and Ultimate Force (series 2).[14][25]\\r\\nIn Spring 2004, Armitage landed his first leading role as textile mill owner John Thornton in the BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's North & South.[27] The director and producers took a chance casting a little-known actor for their leading man (he was the first actor to audition for the role and the last person cast),[28] but their instincts proved correct. North & South was an unexpected success and Armitage became an overnight sensation in the UK.[29] The BBC message boards crashed shortly after the telecast as a result of chatter about him[18] and he was hailed as the new \\"Mr. Darcy\\"[30][31] (referring to Colin Firth's \\"Mr Darcy\\" whom many regard as the definitive romantic leading man). Armitage never perceived John Thornton as the ideal romantic leading man role and was surprised by the overwhelming response.[32] Instead, he said that he felt personally drawn to the role, as his father's family had been weavers. He cited Thornton's dualism as drawing him to the character. \\"The dichotomy between the powerful, almost monstrous, entrepreneur and this kind of vulnerable boy is exciting for me to look at.\\"[28]\\r\\nIn 2005, he played Peter MacDuff in Macbeth in the BBC's ShakespeaRe-Told series and appeared as a recovering gambling addict in one episode of Inspector Lynley Mysteries.[33] He starred in The Impressionists, playing the young Claude Monet,[34] and as Dr Alec Track in ITV's The Golden Hour, a medical series based on the London Air Ambulance.[35] His first substantial role in movies was in the independent film Frozen.[36]\\r\\nIn 2006, Armitage was cast as Guy of Gisborne in the BBC series Robin Hood, which was filmed entirely in Hungary.[18] \\"In order to sustain the character of Guy, you have to find the conflict within him. He's constantly pulled between good and evil, between who he wants to be and who he actually is. He could have been a good man, but he is forever dragged down by his fatal flaw ÿ that he wants glory at all costs.\\"[37] Approaching the third series, he said, \\"I do love playing him, but with a character like Gisborne, if you give him what he needs, then in a way, it's over. That character is only interesting when he isn't getting what he wants, whether it's power, money or the girl.\\"[38] The third and final series of Robin Hood started on 28 March 2009.\\r\\nArmitage appeared in a two-part 2006/07 Christmas/New Years special of The Vicar of Dibley, as Harry Kennedy, the vicar's new love interest (and eventual husband). He reprised the role in 2007 for Red Nose Day. On 8 April 2007, he played biker Ricky Deeming in the detective drama George Gently with Martin Shaw and Lee Ingleby. On 9 May 2007, he appeared in the BBC Four production of Miss Marie Lloyd ÿ Queen of The Music Hall playing Marie Lloyd's first husband, Percy Courtenay. He also appeared in the Granada TV production of Agatha Christie's novel Ordeal by Innocence as the character Philip Durrant.\\r\\nArmitage joined the cast of Spooks as the character Lucas North for series 7, which began on 27 October 2008 in the UK.[4] Armitage notes that the character, who spent eight years in a Russian prison, has a personable exterior, but is psychologically damaged. \\"I love films with a combination of action and good characters. That's why Lucas is interesting as I get to play someone with a complex psychology who goes out there and tries to save the world.\\"[39] During the filming of series 7 Armitage allowed himself to be subjected to waterboarding to film a flashback sequence.[40] In July 2010, Armitage completed filming of series 9, his final series. In this last series, his character's real name was revealed as John Bateman, who had murdered the real Lucas North shortly before North began employment with MI5. Bateman had stolen North's identity and taken his place.[41]\\r\\nOn 20 May 2009, Armitage appeared in the BBC1 drama Moving On as John Mulligan.\\r\\nIn May 2010, Armitage starred as former S.A.S. trooper John Porter in Strike Back (also known as Chris Ryan's Strike Back) for Sky1.[5] Filmed in South Africa, Armitage found the main challenge of the role was to show how the character resolved being a trained killer with having a family and home life.[42] \\"In the end it was the character I was attracted to, the story of a man who makes a decision under pressure and that decision has a knock-on effect on his whole life,\\" he said. \\"He goes in search of atonement still believing he did the right thing even though it cost the lives of three of his friends... There's anger and there's injustice. It's like, 'I did the right thing, with the wrong outcome.'\\"[43] By the time Sky1 and Cinemax decided to commission a second series of Strike Back called Strike Back: Project Dawn, Armitage had already committed to The Hobbit and was unable to continue in the series. However, he appeared as a guest star in the first episode to resolve John Porters fate.[44][45]\\r\\nIronically, it was his role as John Porter that led to his casting in Captain America: The First Avenger. US casting agents noticed posters of him as John Porter all over London. Although unknown to them, they offered him the role of Nazi spy Heinz Kruger because he looked the part. Armitage accepted and shot his scenes in the autumn of 2010, after filming wrapped on Spooks, series 9. (The film was released in July 2011).[46][47]\\r\\nOn 21 October 2010, Peter Jackson announced Armitage was cast as Thorin Oakenshield in the three-film production of The Hobbit.[2] Principal photography in New Zealand ran from March 2011 to July 2012 (broken into three filming blocks with breaks in-between) and pick-ups were shot in the summer of 2013 .[48] All three films were released in December, starting with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in 2012, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug in 2013 and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies in 2014. Armitage thought it was a wonderful opportunity, as he grew up reading the books. Coincidentally, one of his first stage roles was playing an elf in a production of The Hobbit at the \\"Alex\\" Theatre in Birmingham.[49] He describes the character of Thorin as being complex and flawed, \\"somebody that had doubts and that had fears, and there was a gentle side to him and a very perhaps lonely side to him.\\"[50] He notes the scene with Balin in Bag End shows the character's inner sensitivity and fear of failure, \\"failing where his father and his grandfather had failed as well.\\"[50]\\r\\nImmediately after filming wrapped on The Hobbit, Armitage flew to Detroit, Michigan to film Into the Storm from July to September 2012.[51][52] He starred as Gary Fuller, a high school Vice Principal with two teenage sons.[53] The film from New Line was released in August 2014.[54]\\r\\nIn March 2014, Armitage began the eight-week shoot of an adaptation of Bernard Hare's memoir Urban Grimshaw and the Shed Crew in Leeds, UK.[55][56][57] He played \\"Chop\\" (the author's nickname), an ex-social worker, drunk and drug addict in Britain's lowerclass who befriends the hardened young delinquent Urban.[55][58] Armitage explained his attraction to this role: it ticks a few boxes for me: its based on a really interesting piece of literature, but also based on living people, who have been working with us on set.[59] Urban and the Shed Crew premiered at the Leeds International Film Festival (LIFF) on 7 November 2015.[60]\\r\\nArmitage next appeared as John Proctor in The Old Vic's production of Arthur Miller's The Crucible. Directed by Ya?l Farber and performed in the round, the play ran from 21 June to 13 September 2014.[61] The production drew an unprecedented number of 5-star reviews and was a commercial success. For his performance, Armitage was awarded Best Leading Actor in a New Production of a Play by Broadway World:UK Awards 2014[62] and a Best Actor nomination for an Olivier Award.[8] Due to overwhelming worldwide demand to see the production, Digital Theatre captured the live performance to bring The Crucible to cinemas and for digital download. It was screened at cinemas on 4 and 7 December 2014 in the UK and Ireland, with further screenings in other selected territories in February and March 2015.[6][7] (Copyright issues prevented the film from being screened at North American cinemas.[63]) Digital Theatre made the digital download available worldwide on 17 March 2015.[64]\\r\\nIn a September 2014 interview, Armitage revealed he would film his cameo role of King Oleron in Alice Through the Looking Glass in London after The Crucible closed.[65][66] The film was released in May 2016.\\r\\nArmitage spent four weeks in October 2014 filming Sleepwalker in the greater Los Angeles area. In this psychological thriller, Armitage plays Dr. Scott White, a senior MD at a sleep research centre. No release date has been set.[67][68]\\r\\nDeLaurentiis Company tweeted on 13 January 2015 that Armitage was cast as Francis Dolarhyde (aka The Tooth Fairy) in their acclaimed TV production of Hannibal,[69] written and co-produced by Bryan Fuller. Dolarhyde is a serial killer, a character type which Armitage had expressed interest in portraying.[70] He filmed the series in Toronto, Canada from January[71] to April,[72] and the series aired from 4 June to 29 August 2015.[73] Armitage appeared in the last six episodes of season 3,[74][75] earning high praise, wide acclaim[76][77][78] and several award nominations, including two wins.[79][80][81]\\r\\nImmediately after wrapping on Hannibal in late April 2015, Armitage joined his fellow Pilgrimage castmates[82] who had already begun filming in Connemara, Ireland two weeks prior.[83] He plays Sir Raymond De Merville, a 13th-century French Norman who is intent on foiling a group of monks escorting a sacred relic from Ireland to Rome.[84][85] The cast and crew later moved to the Ardennes region of Belgium to complete filming,[86] with Armitage wrapping one week earlier than the official film wrap at the end of May.[87][88]\\r\\nNews broke on 13 May 2015 that Armitage would star in Clearance, the first English language film by Finnish director Aku Louhimies and set to film in South Africa in November 2015.[89] It is an action drama about a hardened mine expert named Ray (Armitage) and his pregnant partner (Naomi Harris) who are kidnapped in South Sudan. Sources differ on whether Ray is forced to cross a vast minefield to gain his freedom[90] or if Ray and his partner make their escape across a vast minefield.[89]\\r\\nIn a June 2015 interview,[91] Armitage mentioned his next projects included an Edith Wharton film and a true Irish tragic drama. Per agent David Higham, Bridget Cleary is likely the Irish drama.[92]\\r\\nOn 12 July 2015, Armitage revealed he was about to start filming Brain on Fire in Vancouver, Canada.[93] Subsequent news outlets provided more details about his role as \\"Big Man\\" Tom Cahalan, father of the protagonist in the true-life story of young journalist Susannah Cahalan's sudden descent into inexplicable madness and the eleventh-hour diagnosis by one doctor.[94] Filming began 13 July 2015. Brain on Fire premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on 14 September 2016.[95]\\r\\nArmitage landed the lead role of Daniel Miller in Berlin Station, an original spy series for Epix. His character, a cerebral analyst from Langley, is a newly anointed undercover CIA officer tasked with finding a mole in Berlin. Filmed in Berlin from November 2015 to April 2016, with some additional filming in the Canary Islands, the series premiered on Epix in the fall of 2016.[96][97]\\r\\nOn 13 July 2016, Roundabout Theatre Company announced Armitage was cast as Kenneth in the American premiere of Love, Love, Love by playwright Mike Bartlett. Love, Love, Love also marks Armitage's first leading role in a theatrical play on an American stage. The off-Broadway play ran from 22 September to 18 December 2016 at the intimate Laura Pels Theater in New York City.[98]\\r\\nIn January 2017, Armitage joined the cast of Ocean's 8.[99]\\r\\nArmitage was first introduced to voice work while working on the TV drama Robin Hood in 2006. The BBC was publishing novels of the first four episodes of series one and asked Armitage to record the audiobook versions. In recent years, Armitage has also performed a great deal of voice work, such as reading poetry for various radio programmes and starring as Robert Lovelace in BBC Radio 4's production of Clarissa: A History of a Young Lady in April 2010. He has recorded eleven audio books: six based on BBC's Robin Hood, Bernard Cornwell's The Lords of the North, three Georgette Heyer novels for Naxos AudioBooks (Sylvester, or the Wicked Uncle, Venetia, and The Convenient Marriage) and Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: A Novel. He has narrated television documentaries such as Homes from Hell, Empire's Children, Too Poor for Posh School?, The Great Sperm Race, Forest Elephants: Rumble in the Jungle, Surgery School, and Elsa: The Lioness That Changed the World. In 2011, he provided the narration for a series about the Royal Navy flagship HMS Ark Royal,[100] 125 Years of Wimbledon: You Cannot Be Serious, and Fraud Squad. He has also provided the voice-over for many TV and radio advertisements.\\r\\nArmitage was hoping to star in a drama based on Richard III. Armitage was born on the anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth Field, where Richard III was killed and has said \\"I believe it is a great story, a socio-political thriller, a love story and a dynastic tragedy\\".[101] He thinks the story has the potential to be told as a twenty-episode miniseries. A script has been in development since 2010 and \\"a lot of people... are interested [in producing it], but there is no one that will step on the gas.\\"[102] Recently Armitage stated that he is still interested in the project, though he has reservations that he might be too tall and too old to play Richard III.\\r\\nArmitage has described himself as a method actor. \\"Yeah, I suppose I am. In a way it's slightly lazy because it means you don't have to pretend ÿ you just have to believe. As much as it's possible to be like that I suppose I kind of do step in and out, I'm not one of these people that can't talk to other people because I'm in my character, but I kind of do stay with the character, yeah. He's always there. It's like marinating something ÿ you're sitting in a marinade the whole time.\\"[103] He has also spoken of dreaming in character while playing John Porter and Thorin Oakenshield.[104][105] However, recently he rejected the label of \\"method actor\\". \\"I think I'm a concentrating actor. So in order to do my work in the course of a day, particularly with a character like this I have to concentrate. So it's about staying in the scene, staying with my head in the scene and attempting to keep the character with me. It doesn't mean I can't have a conversation or go and make a cup of coffee. But I actually stay with the character for 18 months.\\"[106]\\r\\nHe frequently speaks of developing and being drawn to dualism in his characters.[102] \\"If I'm offered the role of the hero, I immediately look for the antihero within!... I see everything in terms of an outer skin and an inner skin.\\"[107] He creates \\"character diaries\\" with entire biographies for the characters he plays. \\"It was important to me to put in a background for my character that would be useful for the whole journey. A lot of that is secret and no one gets to read that. It's what is useful to me. If you are playing something long-running and a role that has a future [beyond the initial series], it's almost like you have to plant a garden which you will need to come back to at some point. If you don't put in early, it can jar with you.\\"[20]","input":"Who is the actor that plays thorin oakenshield?"},{"output":"Victoria Claflin Woodhull","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nVictoria Claflin Woodhull, later Victoria Woodhull Martin (September 23, 1838?ÿ June 9, 1927), was an American leader of the women's suffrage movement.  In 1872, she ran for President of the United States. While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States, some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run. They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35. However, election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue; this may, however, be due to the fact that no one took the candidacy seriously (Woodhull's 35th birthday was in September 1873, seven months after the March inauguration).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn activist for women's rights and labor reforms, Woodhull was also an advocate of \\"free love\\", by which she meant the freedom to marry, divorce and bear children without social restriction or government interference.[2] \\"They cannot roll back the rising tide of reform,\\" she often said. \\"The world moves.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull twice went from rags to riches, her first fortune being made on the road as a fraudulent magnetic healer[4] before she joined the spiritualist movement in the 1870s.[5] Authorship of many of her articles is disputed (many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull, her backers, and her second husband, Colonel James Blood[6]). However, despite her ethical problems, her role as a representative of these movements was powerful. Together with her sister, Tennessee Claflin, she was the first woman to operate a brokerage firm on Wall Street, making a second, and more reputable fortune.[7] They were among the first women to found a newspaper in the United States, Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, which began publication in 1870.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull was politically active in the early 1870s, when she was nominated as the first woman candidate for the United States presidency. Woodhull was the candidate in 1872 from the Equal Rights Party, supporting women's suffrage and equal rights; her running mate was black abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass. A check on her activities occurred when she was arrested on obscenity charges a few days before the election. Her paper had published an account of the alleged adulterous affair between the prominent minister Henry Ward Beecher and Elizabeth Tilton which had rather more detail than was considered proper at the time. However, it all added to the sensational coverage of her candidacy.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was born Victoria California Claflin, the seventh of ten children (six of whom survived to maturity),[10] in the rural frontier town of Homer, Licking County, Ohio.  Her mother, Roxanna \\"Roxy\\"[10] Hummel Claflin, was illegitimate and illiterate.[11]  She had become a follower of the Austrian mystic Franz Mesmer and the new spiritualist movement.[citation needed]  Her father, Reuben \\"Old Buck\\"[10] Buckman Claflin,[12][13] was a con man and snake oil salesman.[10]  He came from an impoverished branch of the Massachusetts-based Scots-American Claflin family, semi-distant cousins to Massachusetts Governor William Claflin.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull was whipped by her father, according to biographer Theodore Tilton.[14]  Biographer Barbara Goldsmith claimed she was also starved and sexually abused by her father when still very young.[15] She based her incest claim on a quote from Theodore Tilton's biography: \\"But the parents, as if not unwilling to be rid of a daughter whose sorrow was ripening her into a woman before her time, were delighted at the unexpected offer.\\"[16][17] Biographer Myra MacPherson disputes Goldsmith's claim that \\"Vickie often intimated that he sexually abused her\\" as well as the accuracy of Goldsmith's quote that \\"Years later, Vickie would say that Buck made her 'a woman before my time.'\\"[15] Macpherson wrote, \\"Not only did Victoria not say this, there was no 'often' involved, nor was it about incest.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull believed in spiritualism ÿ she referred to \\"Banquo's Ghost\\" from Shakespeare's Macbeth ÿ because it gave her belief in a better life.  She said that she was guided in 1868 by Demosthenes to what symbolism to use supporting her theories of Free Love.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they grew older, Victoria became close to her sister Tennessee Celeste Claflin (called Tennie), seven years her junior and the last child born to the family. As adults they collaborated in founding a stock brokerage and newspaper in New York City.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy age 11, Woodhull had only three years of formal education, but her teachers found her to be extremely intelligent.  She was forced to leave school and home with her family when her father, after having \\"insured it heavily,\\"[4] burned the family's rotting gristmill.  When he tried to get compensated by insurance, his arson and fraud were discovered; he was run off by a group of town vigilantes.[4] The town held a \\"benefit\\" to raise funds to pay for the rest of the family's departure from Ohio.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she was 14, Victoria met 28-year-old Canning Woodhull (listed as \\"Channing\\" in some records), a doctor from a town outside Rochester, New York. Her family had consulted him to treat the girl for a chronic illness.  Woodhull practiced medicine in Ohio at a time when the state did not require formal medical education and licensing. By some accounts, Woodhull abducted Victoria to marry her.[20] Woodhull claimed to be the nephew of Caleb Smith Woodhull, mayor of New York City from 1849 to 1851; he was in fact a distant cousin.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were married on November 20, 1853.[22][23] Their marriage certificate was recorded in Cleveland on November 23, 1853, when Victoria was two months past her 15th birthday.[4][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nVictoria soon learned that her new husband was an alcoholic and a womanizer.  She often had to work outside the home to support the family. She and Canning had two children, Byron and Zulu (later called Zula) Maude Woodhull.[25]  Byron was born with an intellectual disability in 1854, a condition Victoria believed was caused by her husband's alcoholism.[26] Another version recounted that her son's disability was caused by a fall from a window.  After their children were born, Victoria divorced her husband and kept his surname.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 1866,[27] Woodhull married Colonel James Harvey Blood, who also was marrying for a second time. He had served in the Union Army in Missouri during the American Civil War, and had been elected as city auditor of St. Louis, Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull's support of free love likely started after she discovered the infidelity of her first husband, Canning. Women who married in the United States during the 19th century were bound into the unions, even if loveless, with few options to escape. Divorce was limited by law and considered socially scandalous. Women who divorced were stigmatized and often ostracized by society. Victoria Woodhull concluded that women should have the choice to leave unbearable marriages.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull believed in monogamous relationships, although she also said she had the right to change her mind. The choice to have sex or not was, in every case, the woman's choice, since this would place her in an equal status to the man, who had the capacity to rape and physically overcome a woman, whereas a woman did not have that capacity with respect to a man.[29]\\r\\nWoodhull said:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo woman, by nature, belongs the right of sexual determination. When the instinct is aroused in her, then and then only should commerce follow. When woman rises from sexual slavery to sexual freedom, into the ownership and control of her sexual organs, and man is obliged to respect this freedom, then will this instinct become pure and holy; then will woman be raised from the iniquity and morbidness in which she now wallows for existence, and the intensity and glory of her creative functions be increased a hundred-fold . . .[30]\\r\\nIn this same speech, which became known as the \\"Steinway speech,\\" delivered on Monday, November 20, 1871, in Steinway Hall, New York City, Woodhull said of free love:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Yes, I am a Free Lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please, and with that right neither you nor any law you can frame have any right to interfere.\\"[31]\\r\\nWoodhull railed against the hypocrisy of society's tolerating married men who had mistresses and engaged in other sexual dalliances. In 1872, Woodhull publicly criticized well-known clergyman Henry Ward Beecher for adultery. Beecher was known to have had an affair with his parishioner Elizabeth Tilton, who had confessed to it, and the scandal was covered nationally. Woodhull was prosecuted on obscenity charges for sending accounts of the affair through the federal mails, and she was briefly jailed. This added to sensational coverage during her campaign that autumn for the United States presidency.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke out in person against prostitution and considered marriage for material gain a form of it. But in her journal, Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, Woodhull expressed support for the legalization of sex work.[33]  A personal account from one of Colonel Blood's friends suggests that Tennessee was held against her will in a brothel until Woodhull rescued her, but this story remains unconfirmed.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Woodhull's earlier radicalism had stemmed from the Christian socialism of the 1850s, for most of her life, she was involved in Spiritualism and didn't use religious language in her public speeches. However, in 1875, Woodhull began publicly  espousing Christianity and changed her political stances.[34]:240 She exposed Spiritualist frauds in her periodical, alienating her Spiritualist followers.[34]:240f She wrote articles against promiscuity, calling it a \\"curse of society\\".[35] Woodhull repudiated her earlier views on free love, and began idealizing purity, motherhood, marriage, and the Bible in her writings.[36][37]:30[34]:247 She even claimed that some works had been written in her name without her consent.[38] Historians doubt Woodhull's claim in this matter.[37]:222\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull, with sister Tennessee (Tennie) Claflin, became the first female stockbrokers and in 1870 they opened a brokerage firm on Wall Street. Wall Street brokers were shocked. Petticoats Among the Bovine and Ursine Animals,\\" the New York Sun headlined.[39] Woodhull, Claflin & Company opened in 1870, with the assistance of the wealthy Cornelius Vanderbilt, an admirer of Woodhull's skills as a medium; he is rumoured to have been her sister Tennie's lover, and to have seriously considered marrying her.[40]  Woodhull made a fortune on the New York Stock Exchange by advising clients like Vanderbilt.  On one occasion she told him to sell his shares short for 150 cents per stock, which he duly followed, and earned millions on the deal.  Newspapers such as the New York Herald hailed Woodhull and Claflin as \\"the Queens of Finance\\" and \\"the Bewitching Brokers.\\"[41] Many contemporary men's journals (e.g., The Days' Doings) published sexualized images of the pair running their firm (although they did not participate in the day-to-day business of the firm), linking the concept of publicly minded, un-chaperoned women with ideas of \\"sexual immorality\\" and prostitution.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the date of May 14, 1870, Woodhull and Claflin used the money they had made from their brokerage to found a newspaper, the Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, which at its height had national circulation of 20,000. Its primary purpose was to support Victoria Claflin Woodhull for President of the United States. Published for the next six years, feminism was the Weekly's primary interest, but it became notorious for publishing controversial opinions on taboo topics, advocating among other things sex education, free love, women's suffrage, short skirts, spiritualism, vegetarianism, and licensed prostitution. History often states the paper advocated birth control, but some historians disagree. The paper is now known for printing the first English version of Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto in its edition of December 30, 1871, and the paper argued the cause of labor with eloquence and skill.  James Blood and Stephen Pearl Andrews wrote the majority of the articles, as well as other able contributors.[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1872, the Weekly published a story that set off a national scandal and preoccupied the public for months. Henry Ward Beecher, a renowned preacher of Brooklyn's Plymouth Church, had condemned Woodhull's free love philosophy in his sermons. But a member of his church, Theodore Tilton, disclosed to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a colleague of Woodhull, that his wife had confessed Beecher was committing adultery with her. Provoked by such hypocrisy, Woodhull decided to expose Beecher. He ended up standing trial in 1875, for adultery in a proceeding that proved to be one of the most sensational legal episodes of the era, gripping the attention of hundreds of thousands of Americans: the trial ended with a hung jury; but the church won the case hands down.[44] On November 2, 1872, Woodhull, Claflin and Col. Blood were arrested and charged with publishing an obscene newspaper and circulating it through the United States Postal Service. In the raid, 3,000 copies of the newspaper were found. It was this arrest and Woodhull's acquittal that propelled Congress to pass the 1873 Comstock Laws.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Francis Train once defended her. Other feminists of her time, including Susan B. Anthony, disagreed with her tactics in pushing for women's equality. Some characterized her as opportunistic and unpredictable; in one notable incident, she had a run-in with Anthony during a meeting of the National Women's Suffrage Association (NWSA). (The radical NWSA later merged with the conservative American Women's Suffrage Association [AWSA] to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull learned how to infiltrate the all-male domain of national politics and arranged to testify on women's suffrage before the House Judiciary Committee.[27] Woodhull argued that women already had the right to vote? all they had to do was use it? since the 14th and 15th Amendments guaranteed the protection of that right for all citizens.[47] The simple but powerful logic of her argument impressed some committee members.  Learning of Woodhull's planned address, suffrage leaders postponed the opening of the 1871 National Woman Suffrage Association's third annual convention in Washington in order to attend the committee hearing. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Isabella Beecher Hooker, saw Woodhull as the newest champion of their cause.  They applauded her statement: \\"[W]omen are the equals of men before the law, and are equal in all their rights.\\"[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the power of her first public appearance as a woman's rights advocate, Woodhull moved to the leadership circle of the suffrage movement. Although her Constitutional argument was not original, she focused unprecedented public attention on suffrage. Woodhull was the first woman ever to petition Congress in person. Numerous newspapers reported her appearance before Congress. Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper printed a full-page engraving of Woodhull, surrounded by prominent suffragists, delivering her argument.[27][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull joined the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the First International.  She supported its goals by articles in her newspaper.  In the United States, many Yankee radicals, former abolitionists and other progressive activists, became involved in the organization, which had been founded in England. German-American and ethnic Irish nearly lost control of the organization, and feared its goals were going to be lost in the broad-based, democratic egalitarianism promoted by the Americans. In 1871, the Germans expelled most of the English-speaking members of the First International's U.S. sections, leading to the quick decline of the organization, as it failed to attract the ethnic working class in America.[49] Karl Marx commented disparagingly on Woodhull in 1872, and expressed approval of the expulsions.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull announced her candidacy for President by writing a letter to the editor of the New York Herald on April 2, 1870.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull was nominated for President of the United States by the newly formed Equal Rights Party on May 10, 1872, at Apollo Hall, New York City. A year earlier, she had announced her intention to run. Also in 1871, she spoke publicly against the government being composed only of men; she proposed developing a new constitution and a new government a year thence.[52] Her nomination was ratified at the convention on June 6, 1872. They nominated the former slave and abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass for Vice President. He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination.  He served as a presidential elector in the United States Electoral College for the State of New York. This made her the first woman candidate.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States, some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run. They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35.  However, election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue.  The presidential inauguration was in March 1873. Woodhull's 35th birthday was in September 1873.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull's campaign was also notable for the nomination of Frederick Douglass, although he did not take part in it. His nomination stirred up controversy about the mixing of whites and blacks in public life and fears of miscegenation. The Equal Rights Party hoped to use the nominations to reunite suffragists with African-American civil rights activists, as the exclusion of female suffrage from the Fifteenth Amendment two years earlier had caused a substantial rift between the groups.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving been vilified in the media for her support of free love, Woodhull devoted an issue of Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly (November 2, 1872) to an alleged adulterous affair between Elizabeth Tilton and Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent Protestant minister in New York. He supported female suffrage but had lectured against free love in his sermons.  Woodhull published the article to highlight what she saw as a sexual double standard between men and women.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat same day, a few days before the presidential election, U.S. Federal Marshals arrested Woodhull; her second husband, Colonel James Blood; and her sister Tennie on charges of \\"publishing an obscene newspaper\\" because of the content of this issue.[53] The sisters were held in the Ludlow Street Jail for the next month, a place normally reserved for civil offenses but that contained more hardened criminals as well. The arrest was arranged by Anthony Comstock, the self-appointed moral defender of the nation at the time. Opponents raised questions about censorship and government persecution. The three were acquitted on a technicality six months later, but the arrest prevented Woodhull from attempting to vote during the 1872 presidential election. With the publication of the scandal, Theodore Tilton, Elizabeth's husband, sued Beecher for \\"alienation of affection.\\" The later trial in 1875 was sensationalized across the nation and eventually resulted in a hung jury.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull received no electoral votes in the election of 1872, an election in which six different candidates received at least one electoral vote, and an unknown (but negligible) percentage of the popular vote. An unrelated man in Texas admitted to voting for her, saying he was casting his vote against Grant.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull again tried to gain nominations for the presidency in 1884 and 1892. Newspapers reported that her 1892 attempt culminated in her nomination by the \\"National Woman Suffragists' Nominating Convention\\" on September 21. Marietta L. B. Stow of California was nominated as the candidate for vice president.  The convention was held at Willard's Hotel in Boonville, New York, and Anna M. Parker was its president.  Some woman's suffrage organizations repudiated the nominations, however, claiming that the nominating committee was unauthorized. Woodhull was quoted as saying that she was \\"destined\\" by \\"prophecy\\" to be elected president of the United States in the upcoming election.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1876, Woodhull divorced her second husband, Colonel Blood. After Cornelius Vanderbilt's death in 1877, William Henry Vanderbilt paid Woodhull and her sister Claflin $1,000 (equivalent to $23,000 in 2017[55]) to leave the country because he was worried they might testify in hearings on the distribution of the elder Vanderbilt's estate. The sisters accepted the offer and moved to Great Britain in August 1877.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made her first public appearance as a lecturer at St. James's Hall in London on December 4, 1877. Her lecture was called \\"The Human Body, the Temple of God,\\" a lecture which she had previously presented in the United States. Present at one of her lectures was the banker John Biddulph Martin. They began to see each other and married on October 31, 1883. His family disapproved of the union but eventually gave in.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom then on, she was known as Victoria Woodhull Martin. Under that name, she published the magazine The Humanitarian from 1892 to 1901 with help from her daughter, Zula Woodhull. After her husband died in 1901, Martin gave up publishing and retired to the country, establishing residence at Bredon's Norton, where she built a village school with Tennessee and Zula. Through her work at the Bredon's Norton school, she became a champion for education reform in English village schools with the addition of kindergarten curriculum.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer opposition to abortion is frequently cited by opponents of abortion when writing about first wave feminism. The most common Woodhull quotations cited by opponents of abortion are:\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull also promoted eugenics which was popular in the early 20th century prior to World War II.  Her interest in eugenics might have been motivated by the profound intellectual impairment of her son.  She advocated, among other things, sex education, \\"marrying well,\\" and pre-natal care as a way to bear healthier children and to prevent mental and physical disease.  Her writings demonstrate views closer to those of the anarchist eugenists, rather than the coercive eugenists like Sir Francis Galton.  In 2006, publisher Michael W. Perry discovered, and published in his book \\"Lady Eugenist\\", that Woodhull supported the forcible sterilization of those she considered unfit to breed.  He cited a New York Times article from 1927 in which she concurred with the ruling of the case Buck v. Bell. This was a stark contrast to her earlier works in which she advocated social freedom and opposed government interference in matters of love and marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodhull-Martin died on June 9, 1927 at Norton Park in Bredon's Norton, Worcestershire.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nA cenotaph of Victoria Woodhull is located at Tewkesbury Abbey.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a historical marker located outside the Homer Public Library in Licking County, Ohio to mark Woodhull as the \\"First Woman Candidate For President of the United States.\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1980 Broadway musical Onward Victoria was inspired by Woodhull's life.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership was founded by Naomi Wolf and Margot Magowan in 1997.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Victoria Woodhull was inducted posthumously into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woodhull Sexual Freedom Alliance is an American human rights and sexual freedom advocacy organization, founded in 2003, and named in honor of Victoria Woodhull.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was honored by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President in March 2008 and was included in a map of historical sites related or dedicated to important women.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 26, 2008, she posthumously received the \\"Ronald H.

Under the Constitution, the president is also the Supreme Commander of the Mexican armed forces. The current President is Enrique Pe?a Nieto, who took office on December 1, 2012.\\r\\nCurrently, the office of the President is considered to be revolutionary, in that the powers of office are derived from the Revolutionary Constitution of 1917. Another legacy of the Revolution is its ban on re-election. Mexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term, called a sexenio. No one who has held the post, even on a caretaker basis, is allowed to run or serve again. The constitution and the office of the President closely follow the presidential system of government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter III of Title III of the Constitution deals with the executive branch of government and sets forth the powers of the president, as well as the qualifications for the office. He is vested with the \\"supreme executive power of the Union\\".\\r\\nTo be eligible to serve as president, Article 82 of the Constitution specifies that the following requirements must be met:\\r\\nThe ban on any sort of presidential re-election dates back to the aftermath of the Porfiriato and the end of the Mexican Revolution. It is so entrenched in Mexican politics that it has remained in place even as it was relaxed for other offices. In 2014, the constitution was amended to allow Deputies and Senators to run for a second consecutive term. Previously, Deputies and Senators were barred from successive re-election. However, the president remained barred from re-election, even if it is nonsuccessive.\\r\\nThe presidential term was set at four years from 1821 to 1934, and has been set at six years since 1934. The president is elected by direct, popular, universal suffrage. Whoever wins a simple plurality of the national vote is elected; there is no runoff election.\\r\\nThe most recent former President, Felipe Calder܇n, won with 36.38% of the votes in the 2006 general election, finishing only 0.56 percent above his nearest rival, Andrs Manuel L܇pez Obrador (who contested the official results). Former President Vicente Fox was elected with a plurality of 43% of the popular vote, Ernesto Zedillo won 48% of the vote, and his predecessor Carlos Salinas won with a majority of 50%. The current president, Enrique Pe?a Nieto won 38% of the popular vote.[3]\\r\\nThe history of Mexico has not been a peaceful one. After the fall of dictator Porfirio Daz in 1910 because of the Mexican Revolution, there was no stable government until 1929, when all the revolutionary leaders united in one political party: the National Revolutionary Party, which later changed its name to the Party of the Mexican Revolution, and is now the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Institucional). From then until 1988, the PRI ruled Mexico as a virtual one-party state.\\r\\nToward the end of his term, the incumbent president in consultation with party leaders, selected the PRI's candidate in the next election in a procedure known as \\"the tap of the finger\\" (Spanish: el dedazo). Until 1988, the PRI's candidate was virtually assured of election, winning by margins well over 70 percent of the voteresults that were usually obtained by massive electoral fraud. In 1988, however, the PRI ruptured and the dissidents formed the National Democratic Front with rival center-left parties (now the PRD). Discontent with the PRI, and the popularity of the Front's candidate Cuauhtmoc Crdenas led to worries that PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari would not come close to a majority, and might actually be defeated. While the votes were being counted, the tabulation system mysteriously shut down. The government declared Salinas the winner, leading to stronger than ever allegations of electoral fraud.[4]\\r\\nThe PRI enacted a strict internal discipline and government presence in the country, and electoral fraud became common. After the country regained its peace, this pattern of fraud continued, with the opposition losing every election until the later part of the 20th century. The first presidential election broadly considered legitimate was the one held in 1994, when the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo took office, and in his term several reforms were enacted to ensure fairness and transparency in elections. Partly as a consequence of these reforms, the 1997 federal congressional election saw the first opposition Chamber of Deputies ever, and the 2000 elections saw Vicente Fox of a PAN/PVEM alliance become the first opposition candidate to win an election since 1911. This historical defeat was accepted on election night by the PRI in the voice of President Zedillo; while this calmed fears of violence, it also fueled questions about the role of the president in the electoral process and to whom the responsibility of conceding defeat should fall in a democratic election.\\r\\nThe role of unions in the new balance of power and future elections is documented in works like historian Enrique Krauze's Analysis of the Corporative System.\\r\\nAfter the presidential election, political parties may issue challenges to the election. These challenges are heard by the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judicial Power; after it has heard and ruled on them, the Tribunal must either declare the election invalid, or certify the results of the elections in accordance to their rulings. Once the Tribunal declares the election valid, it issues a \\"Certificate of Majority\\" (Constancia de Mayora) to the candidate who obtained a plurality. That candidate then becomes President-elect. The final decision is made in September, two months after the election is carried out.[5]\\r\\nThe 1917 Constitution borrowed heavily from the Constitution of the United States, providing for a clear separation of powers while giving the president wider powers than his American counterpart. However, this has only recently become the case in practice.\\r\\nFor the first 71 years after the enactment of the 1917 Constitution, the president exercised nearly absolute control over the country. Much of this power came from the de facto monopoly status of the PRI. As mentioned above, he effectively chose his successor as president by personally nominating the PRI's candidate in the next election. In addition, the unwritten rules of the PRI allowed him to designate party officials and candidates all the way down to the local level. He thus had an important (but not exclusive) influence over the political life of the country (part of his power had to be shared with unions and other groups, but as an individual he had no peers). This, and his constitutional powers, made some political commentators describe the president as a six-year dictator, and to call this system an \\"imperial presidency\\". The situation remained largely unchanged until the early 1980s, when a grave economic crisis created discomfort both in the population and inside the party, and the president's power was no longer absolute but still impressive.\\r\\nAn important characteristic of this system is that the new president was effectively chosen by the old one (since the PRI candidate was assured of election) but once he assumed power, the old one lost all power and influence (\\"no reelection\\" is a cornerstone of Mexican politics). In fact, tradition called for the incumbent president to fade into the background during the campaign to elect his successor. This renewed command helped maintain party discipline and avoided the stagnation associated with a single man holding power for decades, prompting Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa to call Mexico's political system \\"the perfect dictatorship\\", since the president's powers were cloaked by democratic practice.\\r\\nWith the democratic reforms of recent years and fairer elections, the president's powers have been limited in fact as well as in name. Vargas Llosa, during the Fox administration, called this new system \\"The Imperfect Democracy\\". The current rights and powers of the president of Mexico are established, limited and enumerated by Article 89 of the Constitution which include the following:\\r\\nA decree is a legislative instrument that has an expiration date and that is issued by one of the three branches of government. Congress may issue decrees, and the President may issue decrees as well. However, they have all the power of laws, but cannot be changed except by the power that issued them. Decrees are very limited in their extent. One such decree is the federal budget, which is issued by congress. The president's office may suggest a budget, but at the end of the day, it is congress that decrees how to collect taxes and how to spend them. A Supreme Court ruling on Vicente Fox's veto of the 2004 budget suggests that the President may have the right to veto decrees from Congress.\\r\\nSince 1997, the Congress has been plural, usually with opposition parties having a majority. Major reforms (tax, energy) have to pass by Congress, and the ruling President usually found his efforts blocked: the PRI's Zedillo by opposing PAN/PRD congressmen, and later the PAN's Fox by the PRI and PRD. The PAN would push the reforms it denied to the PRI and vice versa. This situation, novel in a country where Congress was +90% dominated by the president's party for most of the century, has led to a legal analysis of the president's power. Formerly almost a dictator (because of PRI's party discipline), the current times show the president's power as somewhat limited. In 2004, President Fox threatened to veto the budget approved by Congress, claiming the budget overstepped his authority to lead the country, only to learn no branch of government had the power to veto a decree issued by another branch of government (although a different, non jurisprudence-setting ruling stated he could return the budget with observations).\\r\\nUpon taking office, the President raises his/her right arm to shoulder-level and takes the following oath:\\r\\nProtesto guardar y hacer guardar la Constituci܇n Poltica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos y las leyes que de ella emanen, y desempe?ar leal y patri܇ticamente el cargo de Presidente de la Rep~blica que el pueblo me ha conferido, mirando en todo por el bien y prosperidad de la Uni܇n; y si as no lo hiciere que la Naci܇n me lo demande.\\r\\nTranslation:\\r\\nI affirm to follow and uphold the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States and the laws that emanate from it, and to perform the office of President of the Republic which the people have conferred upon me with loyalty and patriotism, in all actions looking after the good and prosperity of the Union; and if I do not fulfill these obligations, may the Nation demand it of me.\\r\\nThe Mexican Presidential sash has the colors of the Mexican flag in three bands of equal width, with red on top, white in the center, and green on the bottom, worn from right shoulder to left waist; it also includes the National Seal, in gold thread, to be worn chest-high. During the swearing-in ceremony of a newly elected President, the outgoing President turns in the sash to the current President of Congress, who in turn gives it to the new President after the latter has sworn the oath of office. The sash is the symbol of the Executive Federal Power, and may only be worn by the current President.\\r\\nAccording to Article 35 of the Law on the National Arms, Flag, and Anthem, the President must wear the sash at the swearing-in ceremony, when he makes his annual State of the Union report to Congress, during the commemoration of the Grito de Dolores on September 15 of each year, and when he receives the diplomatic credentials of accredited foreign ambassadors and ministers. He is also expected to wear it \\"in those official ceremonies of greatest solemnity\\". The sash is worn from right shoulder to left hip, and should be worn underneath the coat except during the swearing-in ceremony, when both the out-going and incoming president wear it over their coat (Article 36).\\r\\nIn addition to the Presidential Sash, each president receives a Presidential Flag; the flag has imprinted the words Estados Unidos Mexicanos in golden letters and the national coat of arms also in gold.\\r\\nThe President's official residence and main workplace is Los Pinos, located inside the Bosque de Chapultepec (Chapultepec Park).

Some areas of the historic building are open to the public, and others hold some government offices.\\r\\nThe President also has the use of Chapultepec Castle, formerly an Imperial palace of the Second Mexican Empire, and afterwards the official residence of Mexican Presidents until the Presidency of Lzaro Crdenas.\\r\\nArticle 84 of the Mexican Constitution states that \\"in case of absolute absence of a President\\" the following should happen:\\r\\nNo person who has already served as President, whether elected, Provisional, Interim, or Substitute, can be designated as Provisional, Interim, or Substitute President.\\r\\nThe designation of the Secretary of the Interior as the immediate successor dates to August 2012, when the changes to the Constitution were published in the Official Diary.\\r\\nThe succession provisions have come into play only twice since the current constitution was enacted. In 1928, after the assassination of president-elect lvaro Obreg܇n, Congress appointed Emilio Portes Gil as Interim President; Portes Gil served in the position for 14 months while new elections were called. Pascual Ortiz Rubio was elected President in the special elections that followed in 1930, but he resigned in 1932. Abelardo L. Rodrguez was then appointed Interim President to fill out the remainder of Ortiz Rubio's term (under current law Rodrguez would be Substitute President, but at the time there was no distinction between Interim, Substitute, and Provisional Presidents).\\r\\nThere are five living former presidents. The most recent former president to die was Miguel de la Madrid (1982ÿ1988), on 1 April 2012.\\r\\nFormer presidents of Mexico continue to carry the title \\"President\\" until death but are rarely referred by it; they are commonly called ex-Presidents. They are also given protection by the Estado Mayor Presidencial. Former presidents are also given a lifelong pension, which they can refuse, as in the case of Ernesto Zedillo.\\r\\nContrary to what happens in many other countries, former presidents of Mexico do not continue to be important national figures once out of office, and usually lead a discreet life. This is partly because they do not want to interfere with the government of the new president and partly because they may not have a good public image. This tradition can be traced back to the presidency of Lzaro Crdenas. Former president Plutarco Elas Calles had personally selected Crdenas as his successor, and had hoped to control things from behind the scenes as he had for the last five years. However, when Crdenas showed he was going to rule in fact as well as in name, Calles publicly criticized him, prompting Crdenas to have Calles escorted out of the country by military police. Crdenas himself remained silent on the policies of his successor Manuel vila Camacho, establishing a tradition that former presidents do not interfere with their successors.\\r\\nFor example, Ernesto Zedillo holds important offices in the United Nations and in the private sector, but outside of Mexico. It is speculated he lives in a self-imposed exile to avoid the hatred of some of his fellow members of the PRI for having acknowledged the PRI's defeat in the 2000 presidential election. Carlos Salinas also lived in a self-imposed exile in Ireland, but returned to Mexico. He campaigned intensely to have his brother, Ra~l Salinas, freed after he was jailed in the early days of Zedillo's term, accused of drug trafficking and planning the assassination of Jos Francisco Ruiz Massieu. Carlos Salinas also wrote a book on neo-liberal Mexico, secured a position with the Dow Jones Company in the United States, and worked as a professor at several prestigious universities in that country. Felipe Calder܇n was given a contract to work as a professor for Harvard University in 2013, but he returned to Mexico in 2014. It was rumored that he would look after the then newly created Humanist Party;[6] this fact was eventually denied by his wife.[7]\\r\\nAlong with Felipe Calder܇n, two other surviving former presidents, Luis Echeverra and Vicente Fox, still live in Mexico. On June 30, 2006, Echeverra was placed under house arrest under charges of genocide for his role as Secretary of the Interior during the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre.[8] The house arrest was lifted in 2009.","input":"How long can you be president in mexico?"},{"output":"The Scorch Trials","context":"The Maze Runner is a series of young adult dystopian science fiction novels written by American author James Dashner.[1][2] The series consists of The Maze Runner (2009), The Scorch Trials (2010) and The Death Cure (2011), as well as the two prequel novels, The Kill Order (2012) and The Fever Code (2016), and a companion book titled The Maze Runner Files (2013).[1]\\r\\nThe series, revealing details in non-chronological order, tells how the world was devastated by a series of massive solar flares and coronal mass ejections.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maze Runner is the first book in the series and was released on October 6th, 2009.\\r\\nA number of teenagers, who call themselves \\"The Gladers\\", are left in a strange place which they call \\"The Glade\\". Beyond the walls of the Glade is the ever-changing maze, with its horrifying creatures, the Grievers. Every month a newcomer, or greenie, joins the Gladers, sent by a lift with all past memories (except language and other common things) wiped out. The only thing that they really do remember is their name. The ultimate goal of the remaining Gladers, is to find a way out of the Glade. To do so, the runners venture into the maze every day, to map it in an attempt to find a pattern in the maze that would lead them to find an exit. When Thomas, a curious newcomer, arrives at the Glade and ventures into the maze, unusual things begin to happen.\\r\\nThe Scorch Trials is the second book in the series and was released on September 18, 2010.\\r\\nThe Gladers thought that getting through the maze was it; except they did not know that their world was scorched by the sun. The Gladers did not know that they would have to fight for their lives another time. Burning and naked, the earth is a wasteland, its people driven mad by an infection known as the Flare. Instead of freedom, the Gladers must face another trial. They must survive the scorch trials to find their happy ending.\\r\\nThe Death Cure is the third book in the series and was released on October 11, 2011.\\r\\nThomas is locked up in solitary confinement for four weeks. He is then released, and Assistant Director Janson (Rat Man) reveals to him and the other subjects (including Group B) that there is no cure for the Flare but that most of the Gladers and Group B are immune. He warns them that many people in the outside world hate them because of their unnatural resistance to the Flare, and that if they escape they will most likely be in more danger. Later, all Gladers and Group B members have memory restoration and escape. Thomas, Newt and Minho refuse. They later escape with Jorge and Brenda. They then go to a city and have WICKED's devices in their brain disabled. They join forces with Right Arm, an organization against WICKED.\\r\\nThe Kill Order is the fourth book in the series and was released on August 14, 2012. It is the first prequel in the series, set prior to the events of The Fever Code and 13 years before The Maze Runner book.[3] It is followed by The Fever Code.\\r\\nOf the novel, Dashner stated that he wanted to expand the world, but not focus on the main characters of the main Maze Runner trilogy.[4] He also stated that he had originally planned to write a prequel for the series, but that the plans did not become official until he had completed the third book in the trilogy.[5]\\r\\nBefore WICKED was formed, before the Glade was built, before Thomas entered the Maze, Sun Flares hit the earth and mankind was ravaged by disease. Mark and Trina were there when it happened, and they survived. Now a disease of rage and lunacy races across the eastern United States, and theres something suspicious about its origin and its mutating, and all evidence suggests that it will bring humanity to its knees. Mark and Trina are convinced theres a way to save those left living from descending into madness.\\r\\nThe Fever Code is the fifth book in the series and was released on September 27, 2016. It is the second prequel in the series and the fifth installment overall, preceded by The Kill Order and followed by The Maze Runner.\\r\\nThe book is chronologically set in between the events of The Kill Order and immediately before The Maze Runner. The novel is written from the various points of view of the Gladers. The book primarily focuses on the training that Thomas and the others undergo before being sent into the Maze, however, it also explores the relationships between the Gladers before they underwent the \\"Swipe\\", the \\"Purge\\" that is briefly mentioned in The Death Cure and the lives of the Gladers in Thomas' absence, as he is working with WICKED at the time. The book ends with the final moments of Thomas entering the Box ready to be sent to the Maze, leading to the beginning of The Maze Runner.\\r\\nThe Maze Runner Files is a companion book to The Maze Runner series. It was released on January 1, 2013 in e-book form. It is 50 pages long. The book is divided into three parts: Confidential Files, Recovered Correspondence, and Suppressed Memories.\\r\\nIt contains information about the Flare, WICKED and some of the Gladers. It also reveals events such as Thomas and Teresa's first conversation, Minho's Phase Three Trial, Frypan's past, e-mails between WICKED correspondents, and more.\\r\\nBook retailer Barnes & Noble included The Maze Runner book as part of its showcasing of new writers for the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010. Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"Hard to put down, this is clearly just a first installment, and it will leave readers dying to find out what comes next\\".\\r\\nJessica Harrison of the Deseret Morning News labeled The Maze Runner as \\"a thrilling adventurous book for kids ages 13+ that will get readers' hearts pumping and leave them asking for more.\\" She noted that it \\"starts out a bit slow\\" but as it matched Thomas's confusion and picked up pace as he became more accustomed, she wrote that \\"it's almost as if Dashner is easing the reader into what becomes a fast-paced, nonstop action.\\" However, she thought the \\"only drawback\\" was the \\"fictionalized slang\\" that although it \\"feels realistic and fits with his characters, it gets old pretty fast. On the plus side, however, it's used so often that the reader almost becomes desensitized and learns to ignore it.\\"","input":"What is the second maze runner book called?"},{"output":"a Category 3 hurricane","context":"","input":"How strong was hurricane katrina when it hit?"},{"output":"August 27, 1992","context":"The episode list for the Fox sitcom Martin.

Radio personality and ex-child star Danny Bonaduce came to the show twice in a year to discuss his failing marriage (and later divorce) with second wife Gretchen.\\r\\nOn several shows children and/or adults have taken polygraph exams, most particularly done by retired FBI agent, Jack Trimarco. The show is generally serious in tone, leavened with humor from time to time. It has its occasional tense moments and often trashy scenes, like that of The Montel Williams Show, but without melees or aggressive fights on stage, in contrast to tabloid talk shows, such as: The Jerry Springer Show, The Steve Wilkos Show or Maury Povich's program. McGraw is noted for often bringing families back on multiple shows for follow-up \\"therapy\\" sessions in his segment called \\"Dr. Phil Family.\\"\\r\\nGenerally, the program is filmed and guests appear in studio, but in 2006 the Dr. Phil House began as an occasional series.

By the morning of September 3, the fire had grown to 3,000 acres (1,200?ha). On September 5, the fire hopped over the Columbia River into Washington state, near Archer Mountain.[9] The fire trapped 153 hikers and forced them to stay overnight six miles up the trail, trapped on the other side by the Indian Creek Fire. Mountain Wave Search and rescue dropped supplies from a helicopter to the trapped hikers to sustain them overnight. The next morning, Pacific Northwest Search and Rescue, along with Mountain Wave Search and Rescue, escorted the hikers out to Wahtum Lake and bussed them back to the Eagle Creek Trailhead.[3]\\r\\nThe community of Cascade Locks, Oregon was the first to experience mandatory evacuations, with 283 structures, including 15 businesses, being threatened by the fire.

Rainfall during previous days had significantly contained and newly downgraded the fire. The Incident Command Post was relocated from Hood River County Fairgrounds to the Best Western Columbia River Inn in Cascade Locks.[13]\\r\\nIn the early hours of September 6, the Eagle Creek Fire merged with the Indian Creek Fire. Fire officials estimated that, together, over 31,000 acres were actively burning.\\r\\nThe Office of the Oregon State Fire Marshal issued the following statement:\\r\\nThe gorge still looks like the gorge...

Beck","context":"Cognitive therapy (CT) is a type of psychotherapy developed by American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck. CT is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) and was first expounded by Beck in the 1960s. Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model, which states that thoughts, feelings and behavior are all connected, and that individuals can move toward overcoming difficulties and meeting their goals by identifying and changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking, problematic behavior, and distressing emotional responses. This involves the individual working collaboratively with the therapist to develop skills for testing and modifying beliefs, identifying distorted thinking, relating to others in different ways, and changing behaviors.[1] A tailored cognitive case conceptualization is developed by the cognitive therapist as a roadmap to understand the individual's internal reality, select appropriate interventions and identify areas of distress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecoming disillusioned with long-term psychodynamic approaches based on gaining insight into unconscious emotions and drives, Beck came to the conclusion that the way in which his patients perceived, interpreted and attributed meaning in their daily livesa process scientifically known as cognitionwas a key to therapy.[2] Albert Ellis had been working on similar ideas since the 1950s (Ellis, 1956).  He called his approach Rational Therapy (RT) at first, then Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) and later Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeck outlined his approach in Depression: Causes and Treatment in 1967. He later expanded his focus to include anxiety disorders, in Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders in 1976, and other disorders and problems.[3] He also introduced a focus on the underlying \\"schema\\"the fundamental underlying ways in which people process informationabout the self, the world or the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new cognitive approach came into conflict with the behaviorism ascendant at the time, which denied that talk of mental causes was scientific or meaningful, rather than simply assessing stimuli and behavioral responses. However, the 1970s saw a general \\"cognitive revolution\\" in psychology. Behavioral modification techniques and cognitive therapy techniques became joined together, giving rise to cognitive behavioral therapy. Although cognitive therapy has always included some behavioral components, advocates of Beck's particular approach seek to maintain and establish its integrity as a distinct, clearly standardized form of cognitive behavioral therapy in which the cognitive shift is the key mechanism of change.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecursors of certain fundamental aspects of cognitive therapy have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism.[5] For example, Beck's original treatment manual for depression states, \\"The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs cognitive therapy continued to grow in popularity, the Academy of Cognitive Therapy, a non-profit organization, was created to accredit cognitive therapists, create a forum for members to share emerging research and interventions, and to educate consumer regarding cognitive therapy and related mental health issues.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTherapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and looking for new information that could help shift the assumptions in a way that leads to different emotional or behavioral reactions. Change may begin by targeting thoughts (to change emotion and behavior), behavior (to change feelings and thoughts), or the individual's goals (by identifying thoughts, feelings or behavior that conflict with the goals). Beck initially focused on depression and developed a list of \\"errors\\" (cognitive distortion) in thinking that he proposed could maintain depression, including arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over-generalization, and magnification (of negatives) and minimization (of positives).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an example of how CT might work: Having made a mistake at work, a man may believe, \\"I'm useless and can't do anything right at work.\\" He may then focus on the mistake (which he takes as evidence that his belief is true), and his thoughts about being \\"useless\\" are likely to lead to negative emotion (frustration, sadness, hopelessness). Given these thoughts and feelings, he may then begin to avoid challenges at work, which is behavior that could provide even more evidence for him that his belief is true. As a result, any adaptive response and further constructive consequences become unlikely, and he may focus even more on any mistakes he may make, which serve to reinforce the original belief of being \\"useless.\\" In therapy, this example could be identified as a self-fulfilling prophecy or \\"problem cycle,\\" and the efforts of the therapist and patient would be directed at working together to explore and shift this cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who are working with a cognitive therapist often practice the use of more flexible ways to think and respond, learning to ask themselves whether their thoughts are completely true, and whether those thoughts are helping them to meet their goals. Thoughts that do not meet this description may then be shifted to something more accurate or helpful, leading to more positive emotion, more desirable behavior, and movement toward the person's goals. Cognitive therapy takes a skill-building approach, where the therapist helps the person to learn and practice these skills independently, eventually \\"becoming his or her own therapist.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cognitive model was originally constructed following research studies conducted by Aaron Beck to explain the psychological processes in depression.[8]\\r\\nIt divides the mind beliefs in three levels:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, an update of the cognitive model was proposed, called the Generic Cognitive Model (GCM). The GCM is an update of Beck's model that proposes that mental disorders can be differentiated by the nature of their dysfunctional beliefs.[10] The GCM includes a conceptual framework and a clinical approach for understanding common cognitive processes of mental disorders while specifying the unique features of the specific disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsistent with the cognitive theory of psychopathology, CT is designed to be structured,\\r\\ndirective, active, and time-limited, with the express purpose of identifying, reality-testing, and correcting distorted cognition and underlying dysfunctional beliefs.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCognitive restructuring involves four steps:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are six types of automatic thoughts:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther major techniques include:\\r\\n\\r\\nSocratic questions are the archetypal cognitive restructuring techniques. These kinds of questions are designed to challenge assumptions by[16][17]:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat might be another explanation or viewpoint of the situation?\\r\\nWhy else did it happen?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhats the effect of thinking or believing this?\\r\\nWhat could be the effect of thinking differently and no longer holding onto this belief?\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine a specific friend/family member in the same situation or if they viewed the situation this way, what would I tell them?\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples[18] of socratic questions are:\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse assumptions are based on cognitive distortions, such as [19]:\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Psychodynamic approaches, CBT is transparent to the individual receiving services. At the end of the therapy, an individual will often have learned the cognitive therapy skills well enough to \\"be their own therapist,\\" decreasing dependence on a therapist to provide the answers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Beck's theory of the etiology of depression, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence; children and adolescents who experience depression acquire this negative schema earlier. Depressed people acquire such schemas through a loss of a parent, rejection by peers, bullying, criticism from teachers or parents, the depressive attitude of a parent and other negative events. When the person with such schemas encounters a situation that resembles the original conditions of the learned schema in some way, the negative schemas of the person are activated.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeck's negative triad holds that depressed people have negative thoughts about themselves, their experiences in the world, and the future.[22] For instance, a depressed person might think, \\"I didn't get the job because I'm terrible at interviews. Interviewers never like me, and no one will ever want to hire me.\\" In the same situation, a person who is not depressed might think, \\"The interviewer wasn't paying much attention to me. Maybe she already had someone else in mind for the job. Next time I'll have better luck, and I'll get a job soon.\\" Beck also identified a number of other cognitive distortions, which can contribute to depression, including the following: arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, overgeneralization, magnification and minimization.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008 Beck proposed an integrative developmental model of depression[23] that aims to incorporate research in genetics and neuroscience of depression.[24] This model was updated in 2016 to incorporate multiple levels of analyses, new research, and key concepts (e.g., resilience) within the framework of an evolutionary perspective.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCognitive therapy has been applied to a very wide range of behavioral health issues including:\\r\\n\\r\\nA criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., neither subjects nor therapists in psychotherapy studies are blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.[36]","input":"Who developed cognitive therapy for persons with depression?"},{"output":"Kelvin","context":"","input":"Who invented the standard unit of measuring temperature?"},{"output":"Tito Beveridge","context":"Tito's Handmade Vodka is a vodka produced in Austin, Texas, (in the state's first legal distillery)[1][2] established by Tito Beveridge.[3] Prided for being handmade, the vodka is also notable[4] for being made from yellow corn,[2] instead of the more commonly used potatoes or wheat.[3] Using corn results in a mildly sweet aftertaste. The vodka has been advertised as gluten free.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBert Butler \\"Tito\\" Beveridge II is a native of San Antonio, Texas. He received the diminutive nickname \\"Bertito\\", shortened to \\"Tito\\", from his Latino caregivers in childhood. Tito attended the University of Texas where he became a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.\\r\\nBeveridge first produced his spirits as a hobby after making some as gifts[5] and using a pot still.[3] Commercial production began in 1997 when Beveridge formed Fifth Generation, Inc., and established the Mockingbird Distillery, producing just 1,000 cases that year. In 2007, he sold over 160,000 cases. All production is still maintained at the southeast Austin distillery, where he has expanded the number of pot stills and bottling lines.\\r\\nTito's Handmade Vodka has gained market share thanks to some prestigious awards, affordable pricing, and word of mouth advertising. Sales and distribution boomed in 2001 after Tito's Handmade Vodka unanimously won the Double Gold Medal for vodka at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, beating out 71 high-priced vodkas.[6] Also that year, it received a four-star ranking from Spirit Journal[5] and won four stars again in the 2007 edition. Tito's has also received multiple Growth Brand Awards by the Beverage Information Group, a beverage alcohol research firm.\\r\\nTito's is distributed throughout the United States and Canada.[7] Also in 2013, Tito's Handmade Vodka became the exclusive vodka brand served on all United Airlines, American Airlines, and Jet Blue flights.[8]\\r\\nIn 2014, two false advertising lawsuits were filed against Tito's in California and Florida.

Any material which is soluble, can be deposited as a colloid, or is in suspension, or is capable of being melted, may form a stalactite. Stalactites may be composed of lava, minerals, mud, peat, pitch, sand, sinter, and amberat (crystallized urine of pack rats).[1][2] A stalactite is not necessarily a speleothem, though speleothems are the most common form of stalactite because of the abundance of limestone caves.[1][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corresponding formation on the floor of the cave is known as a stalagmite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common stalactites are speleothems, which occur in limestone caves. They form through deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions. Limestone is the chief form of calcium carbonate rock which is dissolved by water that contains carbon dioxide, forming a calcium bicarbonate solution in underground caverns.[4]  The chemical formula for this reaction is:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis solution travels through the rock until it reaches an edge and if this is on the roof of a cave it will drip down.  When the solution comes into contact with air the chemical reaction that created it is reversed and particles of calcium carbonate are deposited.  The reversed reaction is:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn average growth rate is 0.13?mm (0.0051 inches) a year.  The quickest growing stalactites are those formed by a constant supply of slow dripping water rich in calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which can grow at 3?mm (0.12 inches) per year.[6][7] The drip rate must be slow enough to allow the CO2 to degas from the solution into the cave atmosphere, resulting in deposition of CaCO3 on the stalactite. Too fast a drip rate and the solution, still carrying most of the CaCO3, falls to the cave floor where degassing occurs and CaCO3 is deposited as a stalagmite. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll limestone stalactites begin with a single mineral-laden drop of water. When the drop falls, it deposits the thinnest ring of calcite. Each subsequent drop that forms and falls deposits another calcite ring. Eventually, these rings form a very narrow (4 to 5?mm diameter), hollow tube commonly known as a \\"soda straw\\" stalactite. Soda straws can grow quite long, but are very fragile. If they become plugged by debris, water begins flowing over the outside, depositing more calcite and creating the more familiar cone-shaped stalactite.  The same water drops that fall from the tip of a stalactite deposit more calcite on the floor below, eventually resulting in a rounded or cone-shaped stalagmite. Unlike stalactites, stalagmites never start out as hollow \\"soda straws\\".  Given enough time, these formations can meet and fuse to create pillars of calcium carbonate known as a \\"column\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nStalactite formation generally begins over a large area, with multiple paths for the mineral rich water to flow.  As minerals are dissolved in one channel slightly more than other competing channels, the dominant channel begins to draw more and more of the available water, which speeds its growth, ultimately resulting in all other channels being choked off.  This is one reason why formations tend to have minimum distances from one another.  The larger the formation, the greater the interformation distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother type of stalactite is formed in lava tubes while lava is still active inside.[8] The mechanism of formation is the deposition of material on the ceilings of caves, however with lava stalactites formation happens very quickly in only a matter of hours, days, or weeks, whereas limestone stalactites may take up to thousands of years. A key difference with lava stalactites is that once the lava has ceased flowing, so too will the stalactites cease to grow. This means that if the stalactite were to be broken it would never grow back.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe generic term lavacicle has been applied to lava stalactites and stalagmites indiscriminately and evolved from the word icicle.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike limestone stalactites, they can leave lava drips on the floor that turn into lava stalagmites and may eventually fuse with the corresponding stalactite to form a column.\\r\\n\\r\\nShark tooth stalactites The shark tooth stalactite is broad and tapering in appearance. It may begin as a small driblet of lava from a semi-solid ceiling, but then grows by accreting layers as successive flows of lava rise and fall in the lava tube, coating and recoating the stalactite with more material. They can vary from a few millimeters to over a meter in length.[9] \\r\\nSplash stalactites\\r\\nAs lava flows through a tube, material will be splashed up on the ceiling and ooze back down, hardening into a stalactite. This type of formation results in a very irregularly shaped stalactite, looking somewhat like stretched taffy. Often they may be of a different color than the original lava that formed the cave.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTubular lava stalactites\\r\\nWhen the roof of a lava tube is cooling, a skin will form that traps semi-molten material inside. Trapped gases force lava to extrude out through small openings that result in hollow, tubular stalactites analogous to the soda straws formed as depositional speleothems in solution caves,  The longest known is almost 2 meters in length. These are common in Hawaiian lava tubes and are often associated with a drip stalagmite that forms below as material is carried through the tubular stalactite and piles up on the floor beneath. Sometimes the tubular form collapses near the distal end, most likely when the pressure of escaping gases decreased and still-molten portions of the stalactites deflated and cooled.\\r\\nOften these tubular stalactites will acquire a twisted, vermiform appearance as bits of lava crystallize and force the flow in different directions. These tubular lava helictites may also be influenced by air currents through a tube and point downwind.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA common stalactite found seasonally or year round in many caves is the ice stalactite, commonly referred to as icicles, especially on the surface.[10] Water seepage from the surface will penetrate into a cave and if temperatures are below freezing the water will form stalactites. Creation may also be done by the freezing of water vapor.[11] Similar to lava stalactites, ice stalactites form very quickly within hours or days. Unlike lava stalactites however, they may grow back as long as water and temperatures are suitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce stalactites can also form under sea ice when saline water is introduced to ocean water. These specific stalactites are referred to as brinicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce stalactites may also form corresponding stalagmites below them and given time may grow together to form an ice column.\\r\\n\\r\\nStalactites can also form on concrete, and on plumbing where there is a slow leak and calcium, magnesium or other ions in the water supply, although they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment.  These secondary deposits, such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone and others, which are derived from the lime, mortar or other calcareous material in concrete, outside of the \\"cave\\" environment, can not be classified as \\"speleothems\\" due to the definition of the term.[7] The term \\"calthemite\\" is used to encompass the secondary deposits which mimic the shapes and forms of speleothems outside the cave environment.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way stalactites form on concrete is due to different chemistry than those that form naturally in limestone caves and is due of the presence of calcium oxide in cement.  Concrete is made from aggregate, sand and cement. When water is added to the mix, the calcium oxide in the cement reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). The chemical formula for this is:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, any rainwater that penetrates cracks in set (hard) concrete will carry any free calcium hydroxide in solution to the edge of the concrete. Stalactites can form when the solution emerges on the underside of the concrete structure where it is suspended in the air, for example, on a ceiling or a beam.  When the solution comes into contact with air on the underside of the concrete structure, another chemical reaction takes place.  The solution reacts with carbon dioxide in the air and precipitates calcium carbonate.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this solution drops down it leaves behind particles of calcium carbonate and over time these form into a stalactite.  They are normally a few centimeters long and with a diameter of approximately 4 to 5?mm (0.16 to 0.20 inches).[5]  The growth rate of stalactites is significantly influenced by supply continuity of Ca2+ saturated solution and the drip rate. A straw shaped stalactite which has formed under a concrete structure can grow as much as 2?mm per day in length, when the drip rate is approximately 11 minutes between drops.[12] Changes in leachate solution pH can facilitate additional chemical reactions, which may also influence calthemite stalactite growth rates.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White Chamber in the Jeita Grotto's upper cavern in Lebanon contains an 8.2?m (27?ft) limestone stalactite which is accessible to visitors and is claimed to be the longest stalactite in the world. Another such claim is made for a 20?m (66?ft) limestone stalactite that hangs in the Chamber of Rarities in the Gruta Rei do Mato (Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil). However, vertical cavers have often encountered longer stalactites while exploring. One of the longest stalactites viewable by the general public is in Pol an Ionain (Doolin Cave), County Clare, Ireland, in a karst region known as The Burren; what makes it more impressive is the fact that the stalactite is held on by a section of calcite less than 0.3?m2 (3.2?sq?ft).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nStalactites are first mentioned (though not by name) by the Roman natural historian Pliny in a text which also mentions stalagmites and columns and refers to their creation by the dripping of water. The term \\"stalactite\\" was coined in the 17th century by the Danish Physician Ole Worm,[14] who coined the Latin word from the Greek word ϫϫٶ?? (stalaktos, \\"dripping\\") and the Greek suffix -??

Their duties include: searching for drugs and explosives, locating missing people, finding crime scene evidence, and protecting their handlers. Police dogs must remember several verbal cues and hand gestures.[1] The most commonly used breeds are the German Shepherd, Belgian Malinois and Rottweiler.\\r\\nIn many common law jurisdictions, the intentional injuring or killing of a police dog is a felony.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDogs have been used in law enforcement since the Middle Ages. Money was then ide in the villages for the upkeep of the parish constable's bloodhounds that were used for hunting down outlaws.[clarification needed] In France, dogs were used in the 14th century in St. Malo.[clarification needed] Bloodhounds used in Scotland were known as \\"Slough dogs\\" - the word \\"Sleuth\\", (meaning detective) was derived from this.[3]\\r\\nThe rapid urbanization of London in the 19th century increased public concern regarding growing lawlessness - a problem that was far too great to be dealt with by the existing law enforcement of the time. As a result, private associations were formed to help combat crime. Night watchmen were employed to guard premises, and were provided with firearms and dogs to protect themselves from criminals.\\r\\nOne of the first attempts to use K9s in Policing was in 1889 by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police of London, Sir Charles Warren. Warren's repeated failures at identifying and apprehending the serial killer Jack the Ripper had earned him much vilification from the press, including being denounced for not using bloodhounds to track the killer. He soon had two bloodhounds trained for the performance of a simple tracking test from the scene of another of the killer's crimes. The results were far from satisfactory, with one of the hounds biting the Commissioner and both dogs later running off, requiring a police search to find them.[4]\\r\\nIt was in Continental Europe that dogs were first used on a large scale. Police in Paris began using dogs against roaming criminal gangs at night, but it was the police department in Ghent, Belgium that introduced the first organized police dog service program in 1899.[5] These methods soon spread to Austria-Hungary and Germany; in the latter the first scientific developments in the field took place with experiments in dog breeding and training. The German police selected the German Shepherd Dog as the ideal breed for police work and opened up the first dog training school in 1920 in Greenheide.[6] The dogs were systematically trained in obedience to their officers and tracking and attacking criminals.\\r\\nIn Britain, the North Eastern Railway Police were among the first to use police dogs in 1908 to put a stop to theft from the docks in Hull. By 1910, railway police forces were experimenting with other breeds such as Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers, and German Shepherds.[7]\\r\\nFor a dog to be considered for a Police Department, they must first pass a basic obedience training course. They must be able to obey the commands of their handler without hesitation. This allows the officer to have complete control over how much force the dog should use against a suspect. Dogs trained in Europe are usually given commands in the country's native language. Dogs are initially trained with this language for basic behavior, so, it is easier for the officer to learn new words/commands, rather than retraining the dog to new commands. This is contrary to the popular belief that Police Dogs are trained in a different language so that a suspect cannot command the dog against the officer. [8]\\r\\nDogs used in law enforcement are trained to either be either \\"single purpose\\" or \\"dual purpose\\". Single purpose dogs are used primarily for backup, personal protection, and tracking. Dual purpose dogs, however, are more commonly trained. Dual purpose dogs do everything that single purpose dogs do, and also detect either explosives or narcotics, however, they cannot be trained to detect both. Dogs can only be trained for one or the other because the dog cannot communicate to the officer if it found explosives or narcotics. When a narcotics dog in the United States indicates to the officer that it found something, the officer has reasonable suspicion to search whatever the dog alerted on (i.e. bag or vehicle) without a warrant.?[9]\\r\\nSome breeds are used to enforce public order by chasing and detaining suspects either by direct apprehension or a method known as Bark and Hold. K9s such as the German Shepherd breed, have many qualities that make them applicable for the job. A successful K9 should be intelligent, aggressive, strong, and have a good sense of smell. Many police dogs that are chosen are male and remain unneutered to maintain their aggressive behavior, however there are female police dogs which are used for rescue, tracking, and locating bombs and drugs.[12] German Shepherd dogs and Belgian Malinois are most commonly used because of their availability.\\r\\nNotable police dog breeds are:\\r\\nPolice dogs are retired if they become injured to an extent where they will not recover completely, pregnant, or raising puppies, or are too old or sick to continue working. Since many dogs are raised in working environments for the first year of their life and retired before they become unable to perform, the working life of a K9 is 6ÿ9 years.[13]\\r\\nIf these K9s are killed in the line of duty they get the same honors as their human partners.[14]\\r\\nThe Australian Federal Police and other law enforcement agencies are known to employ K9s for security priorities such as airport duties.\\r\\nThe Belgian Canine Support Group is part of the country's federal police. It has 35 dog teams. Some dogs are trained to detect drugs, human remains, hormones or fire accelerants. About a third are tracker dogs trained to find or identify living people. These teams are often deployed to earthquake areas to locate people trapped in collapsed buildings. The federal police's explosive detector dogs are attached to the Federal Police Special Units.\\r\\nMany Canadian municipalities use dog squads as a means of tracking suspects. Most municipalities in Canada employ the bite and hold technique rather than the bark and hold technique meaning once the dog is deployed, it bites the suspect until the dog handler commands it to release. This often results in serious puncture wounds and is traumatic for suspects. A dog has the legal status of property in Canada. As such, developing case law is moving towards absolute liability for the handlers of animals deliberately released to intentionally maim suspects. The dog is effectively a weapon.\\r\\nIn 2010, an Alberta Court of Queen's Bench judge stayed criminal charges against Kirk Steele, a man who was near-fatally shot by a police officer while he stabbed the officer's police dog. The judge found that the shooting was cruel and unusual treatment and excessive force.[15]\\r\\nPolice require reasonable suspicion they will recover evidence in order to use a dog to sniff a person or their possessions in public. This is because using a dog to detect scents is considered a search.[16] The main exemption to that rule are the dogs of the Canada Border Services Agency who are allowed to make searches without warrants under s.98 of the Customs Act.\\r\\nThere are a total of 240 active police dogs in Denmark, each of which are ranked in one of three groups: Group-1, Group-2 and Group-3. Dogs in Group-1 are very experienced, and highly trained. Group-1 dogs are typically within the age range of four to eight years old and are used for patrolling, rescue, searching for biological evidence and major crime investigations. Group-2 dogs are employed for the same tasks as members of Group-1, but they do not participate in major crime investigations or searching for biological evidence. Group-3 is the beginner rank for police dogs, and are only employed for patrol operations. The Danish police have used law enforcement dogs since 1907, and only approve male German Shepherds.\\r\\nThe Police Dog Unit, (Abbreviation: PDU; Chinese: ?˨?) established in 1949, is a specialist force of the Hong Kong Police under the direct command of the Special Operations Bureau. Their roles are crowd control, search and rescue, and poison and explosive detection. In addition, the Police Dog Unit works in collaboration with other departments for anti-crime operations.\\r\\nThe Dutch Mounted Police and Police Dog Service (DLHP) is part of the Korps landelijke politiediensten (KLPD; National Police Services Agency) and supports other units with horse patrols and specially trained dogs. The DLHP's dogs are trained to recognize a single specific scent. They specialize in identifying scents (identifying the scent shared by an object and a person), narcotics, explosives and firearms, detecting human remains, locating drowning people and fire accelerants.\\r\\nThe KLPD is just one of the 26 police regions in the Netherlands. Every other region has its own K-9 unit. For example, the K-9 unit of the regional police Amsterdam-Amstelland has 24 patroldog handlers and 6 specialdog handlers and 4 instructors. The unit has 24 patroldogs, 3 explosives/firearms dogs, 3 active narcotic dogs, 2 passive narcotic dogs,2 scent identifying dogs, 1 crime scene dog and 1 USAR dog. They work on a 24/7 basis, every shift (07:00-15:00/15:00-23:00/23:00-07:00 local time), has a minimum of 2 patroldog handlers on patrol. The special dog handlers work only in the dayshift or after a call.\\r\\nIn India, the National Security Guard inducted Malinois (Belgian Shepherd Dog) into its K-9 Unit, Border Security Force and Central Reserve Police Force use Rajapalayam as guard dogs to support the Force in the borders of Kashmir. Most of the Indian State Local Police use Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd and Doberman Pinscher in their Dog Squads. The Delhi Police has recruited many of the city's street dogs to be trained for security purposes.[17]\\r\\nAll the law enforcement in Italy (Carabinieri, Polizia di Stato and Guardia di Finanza) have in service many patrol dogs for Public Order, Anti-Drug, Anti-explosive, Search and Rescue.\\r\\nOne of the most common breeds used in Russia is the German Shepherd. This is mainly because these dogs are adapted to the climate of the country. Attack dogs have been used for a long time, off and on for foot patrolling. These dogs are kept on a leash at all times and are required to wear a muzzle unless the dog is needed to pursue and detain a suspect. These dogs must remain calm, docile, and unfazed by crowds or noise. Russian Police Dogs may react to any and all stimuli only if they are ordered to do so by their handler. They are a common sight in the public and are often unnerving to the public. German shepherds are also used for tasks such as seeking dangerous fugitives, tracking, and were ultimately chosen as the all-purpose police and army breed. This has remained common in most Soviet Union Successor States.[18]\\r\\nThe Swedish law enforcement acquired its first two dogs in 1910, when two police officers brought Airedale Terrier Cora and shepherd Leo from Hamburg to assist in police investigations,[19] but regular use of K9 did not take off until the 1950s.[20] The Swedish Police Authority currently deploys around 400 police dogs, of which about 70 percent German Shepherds and 20 percent Malinois. The remaining 10 percent consist of a range of breeds, including Boxers, Labradors, and Springer Spaniel[disambiguation needed].[21] There is however no requirement for the dogs to be purebred, as long as they meet mental and physical requirements set by the police. Dogs aged 18ÿ48 months are eligible to take admission tests for the K9 training. The police dogs live with their operators, and after retirement at age 8-10 the operator often assumes the ownership of the dog.[22]\\r\\nPolice forces across the country employ dogs and handlers and dog training schools are available to cater for the ever-increasing number of dogs being used.\\r\\nThere are over 2,500 police dogs employed amongst the various police forces in the UK, with the German Shepherd as the most popular breed for general purpose work. The Belgian Malinois is also gaining in popularity; in 2008, a Belgian Malinois female handled by PC Graham Clarke won the National Police Dog Trials with the highest score ever recorded.\\r\\nAll British police dogs, irrespective of the discipline they are trained in, must be licensed to work operationally. To obtain the license they have to pass a test at the completion of their training, and then again every year until they retire, which is usually at about the age of 8. The standards required to become operational are laid down by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) sub-committee on police dogs and are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that training and licensing reflects the most appropriate methods and standards.\\r\\nMany British police services now source the majority of their replacement dogs from within specialized police dog breeding programs designed to ensure that the dogs are bred with strong working ethics and health as a priority. The Metropolitan Police has the largest police dog breeding program in the UK supplying not only the capital city, London, but many other parts of the UK and the world with police service dogs.\\r\\nIn 2011, a freedom of information request by British broadcaster BBC to all 48 police forces in the UK revealed that between 2008ÿ2010 196 police staff and 155 innocent members of the public were bitten by police dogs.[23] A similar investigation in 2014 revealed that between 2011ÿ2013 police dogs were involved in at least 150 attacks on innocent members of the public including two 10-year-old children.[24]\\r\\nPolice dogs are in widespread use across the United States. K-9 units are operated on the federal, state, county, and local level and are utilized for a wide variety of duties, similar to those of other nations. Their duties generally include drug, bomb, and weapon detection and cadaver searches. The most common police dogs used for everyday duties are German Shepherds, though other breeds may be used to perform specific tasks.\\r\\nOn the federal level, police dogs are rarely seen by the general public, though they may be viewed in some airports assisting Transportation Security Administration officials search for explosives and weapons or by Customs and Border Protection searching for concealed narcotics and people. Some dogs may also be used by tactical components of such agencies as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Marshals Service.\\r\\nMost police agencies in the United States - whether state, county, or local ÿ use K-9s as a means of law enforcement. Often, even the smallest of departments operates a K-9 team of at least one dog, while the officers of more metropolitan cities can be more used to working with dozens. In the former case, police dogs usually serve all purposes deemed necessary, most commonly suspect apprehension and narcotics detection, and teams are often on call; in the latter case, however, individual dogs usually serve individual purposes in which each particular animal is specialized, and teams usually serve scheduled shifts. In both cases, police dogs are almost always cared for by their specific handlers. K-9s are not often seen by the public, though specialized police vehicles used for carrying dogs may be seen from time to time.\\r\\nIt is a felony to assault or kill a federal law enforcement animal, and it is a crime in most states to assault or kill a police animal. Yet despite common belief[citation needed], police dogs are not treated as police officers for the purpose of the law, and attacking a police dog is not punishable in the same manner as attacking a police officer.[citation needed] Though many police departments formally swear dogs in as police officers, this swearing-in is purely honorary, and carries no legal significance.[2]\\r\\nPolice dogs also play a major role in American penal systems. Many jails and prisons will use special dog teams as a means of intervening in large-scale fights or riots by inmates. Also, many penal systems will employ dogs ÿ usually bloodhounds ÿ in searching for escaped prisoners.\\r\\nThe United States Supreme Court is the highest federal court in the United States of America. It holds rulings that are the ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal, and state court cases.\\r\\nSome U.S. Supreme Court cases that pertain to police dogs are:","input":"How many police dogs are there in the uk?"},{"output":"31 October AD 475","context":"Romulus Augustus (Latin: Romulus Augustus; born c.

Romulus, little more than a child, acted as a figurehead for his father's rule and reigned for only ten months. His legitimacy and authority were disputed beyond Italy and Romulus was soon deposed by Odoacer, who had defeated and executed Orestes. Odoacer sent Romulus to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in Campania, after which he disappears from the historical record.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus' father Orestes was a Roman citizen, originally from Pannonia, who had served as a secretary and diplomat for Attila the Hun and later rose through the ranks of the Roman army.[6] The future emperor was named Romulus after his maternal grandfather, a nobleman from Poetovio in Noricum. Many historians have noted the coincidence that the last western emperor bore the names of both Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, and Augustus, the first emperor.[2]\\r\\nOrestes was appointed Magister militum by Julius Nepos in 475. Shortly after his appointment, Orestes launched a rebellion and captured Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire since 402, on 28 August 475. Nepos fled to Dalmatia, where his uncle had ruled a semi-autonomous state in the 460s.[7] Orestes, however, refused to become emperor, \\"from some secret motive\\", said historian Edward Gibbon.[8] Instead, he installed his son on the throne on 31 October 475.\\r\\nThe empire Augustus ruled was a shadow of its former self and had shrunk significantly over the previous 80 years. Imperial authority had retreated to the Italian borders and parts of southern Gaul: Italia and Gallia Narbonensis, respectively.[9] The Eastern Roman Empire treated its western counterpart as a client state. The Eastern Emperor Leo, who died in 474, had appointed the western emperors Anthemius and Julius Nepos, and Constantinople never recognized the new government. Neither Zeno nor Basiliscus, the two generals fighting for the eastern throne at the time of Romulus' accession, accepted him as ruler.[5]\\r\\nAs a proxy for his father, Romulus made no decisions and left no monuments, though coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, Milan, Ravenna, and Gaul.[5] Several months after Orestes took power, a coalition of Heruli, Scirian and Turcilingi mercenaries demanded that he give them a third of the land in Italy.[8] When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under the leadership of the Scirian chieftain Odoacer. Orestes was captured near Piacenza on 28 August 476 and swiftly executed.\\r\\nOdoacer advanced on Ravenna, capturing the city and the young emperor. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited as the end of the Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had already lost its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real powers behind the throne.[10] Italy would suffer far greater devastation in the next century when Emperor Justinian I reconquered it.\\r\\nAfter the abdication of Romulus, the Roman Senate, on behalf of Odoacer, sent representatives to the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno, whom it asked to formally reunite the two halves of the Empire: \\"the west no longer required an emperor of its own: one monarch sufficed for the world\\".[11] He was also asked to make Odoacer a patrician, and administrator of Italy in Zeno's name. Zeno pointed out that the Senate should rightfully have first requested that Julius Nepos take the throne once more, but he nonetheless agreed to their requests. Odoacer then ruled Italy in Zeno's name.[12]\\r\\nThe ultimate fate of Romulus is a mystery. The Anonymus Valesianus wrote that Odoacer, \\"taking pity on his youth\\" (he was about 16), spared Romulus' life and granted him an annual pension of 6,000 solidi before sending him to live with relatives in Campania.[5][13] Jordanes and Marcellinus Comes say Odoacer exiled Romulus to Campania but do not mention any financial support from the Germanic king.[5][13]\\r\\nThe sources do agree that Romulus took up residence in the Castel dell'Ovo (Lucullan Villa) in Naples, now a castle but originally built as a grand sea-side house by Lucullus in the 1st century BC,[13] fortified by Valentinian III in the mid-5th century. From here, contemporary histories fall silent. In the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon notes that the disciples of Saint Severinus of Noricum were invited by a \\"Neapolitan lady\\" to bring his body to the villa in 488; Gibbon conjectures from this that Augustulus \\"was probably no more.\\"[14] The villa was converted into a monastery before 500 to hold the saint's remains.[13]\\r\\nCassiodorus, then a secretary to Theodoric the Great, wrote a letter in 507 to a \\"Romulus\\" confirming a pension.[5] Thomas Hodgkin, a translator of Cassiodorus' works, wrote in 1886 that it was \\"surely possible\\" the Romulus in the letter was the same person as the last western emperor.[15] The letter would match the description of Odoacer's coup in the Anonymus Valesianus, and Romulus could have been alive in the early sixth century. But Cassiodorus does not supply any details about his correspondent or the size and nature of his pension, and Jordanes, whose history of the period abridges an earlier work by Cassiodorus, makes no mention of a pension.\\r\\nAs Romulus was an alleged usurper, Julius Nepos claimed to hold legally the title of the emperor when Odoacer took power. However, few of Nepos' contemporaries were willing to support his cause after he ran away to Dalmatia. Some historians regard Julius Nepos, who ruled in Dalmatia until being murdered in 480, as the last lawful Western Roman Emperor.[16]\\r\\nFollowing Odoacer's coup, the Roman Senate sent a letter to Zeno stating that \\"the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect, at the same time, both the East and the West\\".[17] While Zeno told the Senate that Nepos was their lawful sovereign, he did not press the point, and he accepted the imperial insignia brought to him by the senate.[12][17]\\r\\nAs the last Western Roman emperor before the traditionally agreed-upon end of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus has been portrayed several times in film and literature; the play Romulus the Great (1950), by Friedrich Drrenmatt, focuses on the reign of \\"Romulus Augustus\\" and the end of the Roman Empire in the West. The 2007 film The Last Legion, and the novel on which it is based, includes a heavily fictionalized account of the reign and subsequent life of Romulus Augustus; escaping captivity with the aid of a small band of loyal Romans, he reaches Britain, where he eventually becomes Uther Pendragon.\\r\\n Media related to Romulus Augustus at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When was the last western roman emperor overthrown?"},{"output":"a single calf","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Cetaceans' closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins range in size from the 1.7?m (5.6?ft) long and 50?kg (110?lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5?m (31?ft) and 10?t (11 short tons) killer whale. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at 55.5?km/h (34.5?mph). Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are sometimes hunted in places like Japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film series Free Willy. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. The most common dolphin species kept is the bottlenose dolphin, while there are around 60 captive killer whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name is originally from Greek Ѵ?? (delphs), \\"dolphin\\",[1] which was related to the Greek Ѵ?? (delphus), \\"womb\\".[1] The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning \\"a 'fish' with a womb\\".[2] The name was transmitted via the Latin delphinus[3] (the romanization of the later Greek Ѵ?? ÿ delphinos[1]), which in Medieval Latin became dolfinus and in Old French daulphin, which reintroduced the ph into the word. The term mereswine (that is, \\"sea pig\\") has also historically been used.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term 'dolphin' can be used to refer to, under the parvorder Odontoceti, all the species in the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) and the river dolphin families Iniidae (South American river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (La Plata dolphin), Lipotidae (Yangtze river dolphin) and Platanistidae (Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin).[5][6]\\r\\nThis term has often been misused in the US, mainly in the fishing industry, where all small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises) are considered porpoises,[7] while the fish dorado is called dolphin fish.[8] In common usage the term 'whale' is used only for the larger cetacean species,[9] while the smaller ones with a beaked or longer nose are considered 'dolphins'.[10] The name 'dolphin' is used casually as a synonym for bottlenose dolphin, the most common and familiar species of dolphin.[11] There are six species of dolphins commonly thought of as whales, collectively known as blackfish: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae and qualify as dolphins.[12] Though the terms 'dolphin' and 'porpoise' are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical features such as a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth; they also differ in their behavior. Porpoises belong to the family Phocoenidae and share a common ancestry with the Delphinidae.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of dolphins is called a \\"school\\" or a \\"pod\\". Male dolphins are called \\"bulls\\", females \\"cows\\" and young dolphins are called \\"calves\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, three strange dolphins beached off the Irish coast; they appeared to be hybrids between Risso's and bottlenose dolphins.[15] This mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. In captivity, a bottlenose and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring.[16] A common-bottlenose hybrid lives at SeaWorld California.[17] Other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or have been reported in the wild, such as a bottlenose-Atlantic spotted hybrid.[18] The best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is a fertile hybrid. Two wolphins currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii; the first was born in 1985 from a male false killer whale and a female bottlenose. Wolphins have also been observed in the wild.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5ÿ10 million years later.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeoceti is a parvorder comprising ancient whales. These ancient whales are the predecessors of modern whales, stretching back to their first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete is the presence of visible legs or asymmetrical teeth.[23][24][25][26] Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred with Ambulocetus 49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred around 43 million years ago with Protocetus, the migration of the nasal openings toward the top of the cranium and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with Basilosaurus 35 million years ago, and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs which took place with the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 million years ago.[27][28][29] The modern dolphin skeleton has two small, rod-shaped pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs. In October 2006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in Japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the closest living relatives of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 million years ago.[31] Around 40 million years ago, a common ancestor between the two branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; anthracotheres became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene two-and-a-half million years ago, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage: the hippo.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins have torpedo shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 metres (5.6?ft) long and 50 kilograms (110?lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 metres (31?ft) and 10 metric tons (11 short tons) killer whale. Overall, however, they tend to be dwarfed by other Cetartiodactyls. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins have conical teeth, as opposed to porpoises' spade-shaped teeth. These conical teeth are used to catch swift prey such as fish, squid or large mammals, such as seal.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBreathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs, however this only occurs in the polar regions of the oceans. Dolphins have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll dolphins have a thick layer of blubber, thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.[35][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins' reproductive organs are located inside the body, with genital slits on the ventral (belly) side. Males have two slits, one concealing the dolphin penis and one further behind for the anus.[39] Females have one genital slit, housing the vagina and the anus, with a mammary slit on either side.[40][41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins have two pectoral flippers, containing four digits, a boneless dorsal fin for stability, and a tail fin for propulsion. Although dolphins do not possess external hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to seals which typically cruise at 9ÿ28 kilometres per hour (5.6ÿ17.4?mph); the killer whale (orca), in comparison, can travel at speeds up to 55.5 kilometres per hour (34.5?mph). The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to turn their heads.[43][44] River dolphins, however, have non-fused neck vertebrae and are able to turn their head up to 90.[45]  Dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. All species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from involuntarily spinning in the water.[35][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome dolphins are adapted for diving to great depths. In addition to their streamlined bodies, some can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen. Some can also re-route blood from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart, brain and other organs. Their hemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissues and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than hemoglobin.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dolphin ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.[47] Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation.[35][48][49][50][51] Though most dolphins do not have hair, they do have hair follicles that may perform some sensory function.[52] Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on an object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood.[53] The small hairs on the rostrum of the boto are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for the boto's poor eyesight.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dolphin eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Dolphins do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals.[55] Most dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a  tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe olfactory lobes are absent in dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are often regarded as one of Earth's most intelligent animals, though it is hard to say just how intelligent. Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See cetacean intelligence for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.[56] This altruism does not appear to be limited to their own species. The dolphin Moko in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female Pygmy Sperm Whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times.[57] They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers[58][59] or charging the sharks to make them go away.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistle-like sounds and other vocalizations. Dolphins also use nonverbal communication by means of touch and posturing.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans (and possibly other primate species). In May 2005, a discovery in Australia found Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) teaching their young to use tools. They cover their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters, unlike simian primates, where knowledge is generally passed on to both sexes. Using sponges as mouth protection is a learned behavior.[61] Another learned behavior was discovered among river dolphins in Brazil, where some male dolphins use weeds and sticks as part of a sexual display.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nForms of care-giving between fellows and even for members of different species[63] (see Moko (dolphin))  are recorded in various species -  such as trying to save weakened fellows[64] or female pilot whales holding up dead calves for long periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins engage in acts of aggression towards each other. The older a male dolphin is, the more likely his body is to be covered with bite scars. Male dolphins can get into disputes over companions and females. Acts of aggression can become so intense that targeted dolphins sometimes go into exile after losing a fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMale bottlenose dolphins have been known to engage in infanticide. Dolphins have also been known to kill porpoises for reasons which are not fully understood, as porpoises generally do not share the same diet as dolphins and are therefore not competitors for food supplies.[65] The Cornwall Wildlife Trust records about one such death a year. Possible explanations include misdirected infanticide, misdirected sexual aggression or play behaviour.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphin copulation happens belly to belly; though many species engage in lengthy foreplay, the actual act is usually brief, but may be repeated several times within a short timespan.[67] The gestation period varies with species; for the small Tucuxi dolphin, this period is around 11 to 12 months,[68] while for the orca, the gestation period is around 17 months.[69] Typically dolphins give birth to a single calf, which is, unlike most other mammals, born tail first in most cases.[70] They usually become sexually active at a young age, even before reaching sexual maturity.[67] The age of sexual maturity varies by species and gender.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are known to display non-reproductive sexual behavior, engaging in masturbation, stimulation of the genital area of other individuals using the rostrum or flippers, and homosexual contact.[67][72][73]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious species of dolphin have been known to engage in sexual behavior up to and including copulation with dolphins of other species. Sexual encounters may be violent, with male dolphins sometimes showing aggressive behavior towards both females and other males.[74] Male dolphins may also work together and attempt to herd females in estrus, keeping the females by their side by means of both physical aggression and intimidation, to increase their chances of reproductive success.[75] Occasionally, dolphins behave sexually towards other animals, including humans.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious methods of feeding exist among and within species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the false killer whale and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. Orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish.[78] Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily.[78] Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding.[79][80] Some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking them out of the water.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nReports of cooperative human-dolphin fishing date back to the ancient Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder.[81] A modern human-dolphin partnership currently operates in Laguna, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Here, dolphins drive fish towards fishermen waiting along the shore and signal the men to cast their nets. The dolphins' reward is the fish that escape the nets.[82][83]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: frequency modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function,[84] and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. These whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans.[86] These signature whistles are developed during a dolphin's first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime.[87] In order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. This consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. An auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. Dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishing.[88] Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years.[89] Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. The research on other species done so far has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.[90][91][92][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause dolphins are generally associated in groups, communication is necessary. Signal masking is when other similar sounds (conspecific sounds) interfere with the original acoustic sound.[94] In larger groups, individual whistle sounds are less prominent. Dolphins tend to travel in pods, upon which there are groups of dolphins that range from a few to many. Although they are traveling in these pods, the dolphins do not necessarily swim right next to each other. Rather, they swim within the same general vicinity. In order to prevent losing one of their pod members, there are higher whistle rates. Because their group members were spread out, this was done in order to continue traveling together.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins frequently leap above the water surface, this being done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save the dolphin energy as there is less friction while in the air.[95] This type of travel is known as porpoising.[95] Other reasons include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites.[96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins show various types of playful behavior, often including objects, self-made bubble rings, other dolphins or other animals.[6][98][99] When playing with objects or small animals, common behavior includes carrying the object or animal along using various parts of the body, passing it along to other members of the group or taking it from another member, or throwing it out of the water.[98] Dolphins have also been observed harassing animals in other ways, for example by dragging birds underwater without showing any intent to eat them.[98] Playful behaviour that involves another animal species with active participation of the other animal can also be observed however. Playful human interaction with dolphins being the most obvious example, however playful interactions have been observed in the wild with a number of other species as well, such as humpback whales and dogs.[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuvenile dolphins off the coast of Western Australia have been observed chasing, capturing, and chewing on blowfish.[102]  While some reports state that the dolphins are becoming intoxicated on the tetrodotoxin in the fishes' skin,[103] other reports have characterized this behavior as the normal curiosity and exploration of their environment in which dolphins engage.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve.[105] The neocortex of many species is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids.[106] In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment, and theory of mind.[107] Cetacean spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ? or ? exponent of the body mass.[109] Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalization quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Killer whales have the second largest brain mass of any animal on earth, next to the sperm whale.[110] The brain to body mass ratio in some is second only to humans.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-awareness is seen, by some, to be a sign of highly developed, abstract thinking. Self-awareness, though not well-defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness.[112]\\r\\nThe most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror; they then see if the animal shows signs of self-recognition.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome disagree with these findings, arguing that the results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness.[114] They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, dolphins sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep at a time, thus maintaining enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats. Earlier sleep stages can occur simultaneously in both hemispheres.[115][116][117]\\r\\nIn captivity, dolphins seemingly enter a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli. In this case, respiration is automatic; a tail kick reflex keeps the blowhole above the water if necessary. Anesthetized dolphins initially show a tail kick reflex.[118]  Though a similar state has been observed with wild sperm whales, it is not known if dolphins in the wild reach this state.[119] The Indus river dolphin has a sleep method that is different from that of other dolphin species. Living in water with strong currents and potentially dangerous floating debris, it must swim continuously to avoid injury. As a result, this species sleeps in very short bursts which last between 4 and 60?seconds.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins have few marine enemies. Some species or specific populations have none, making them apex predators. For most of the smaller species of dolphins, only a few of the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, dusky shark, tiger shark and great white shark, are a potential risk, especially for calves.[121] Some of the larger dolphin species, especially orcas (killer whales), may also prey on smaller dolphins, but this seems rare.[122][123] Dolphins also suffer from a wide variety of diseases and parasites.[124][125]  The Cetacean morbillivirus in particular has been known to cause regional epizootics often leaving hundreds of animals of various species dead.[126][127] Symptoms of infection are often a severe combination of pneumonia, encephalitis and damage to the immune system, which greatly impair the cetacean's ability to swim and stay afloat unassisted.[128][129] A study at the U.S. National Marine Mammal Foundation revealed that dolphins, like humans, develop a natural form of type 2 diabetes which may lead to a better understanding of the disease and new treatments for both humans and dolphins.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins can tolerate and recover from extreme injuries such as shark bites although the exact methods used to achieve this are not known. The healing process is rapid and even very deep wounds do not cause dolphins to hemorrhage to death. Furthermore, even gaping wounds restore in such a way that the animal's body shape is restored, and infection of such large wounds seems rare.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study, published in the journal Marine Mammal Science, suggests that at least some dolphins are up to the shark challenge with research finding that many dolphins survive attacks using everything from sophisticated combat moves to teaming up against the shark.[132][133][134]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome dolphin species are at risk of extinction, especially some river dolphin species such as the Amazon river dolphin, and the Ganges and Yangtze river dolphin, which are critically or seriously endangered. A 2006 survey found no individuals of the Yangtze river dolphin, which now appears to be functionally extinct.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nPesticides, heavy metals, plastics, and other industrial and agricultural pollutants that do not disintegrate rapidly in the environment concentrate in predators such as dolphins.[136] Injuries or deaths due to collisions with boats, especially their propellers, are also common.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious fishing methods, most notably purse seine fishing for tuna and the use of drift and gill nets, unintentionally kill many dolphins.[137] Accidental by-catch in gill nets and incidental captures in antipredator nets that protect marine fish farms are common and pose a risk for mainly local dolphin populations.[138][139] In some parts of the world, such as Taiji in Japan and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.[140] Dolphin meat is high in mercury and may thus pose a health danger to humans when consumed.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphin safe labels attempt to reassure consumers that fish and other marine products have been caught in a dolphin-friendly way. The earliest campaigns with \\"Dolphin safe\\" labels were initiated in the 1980s as a result of cooperation between marine activists and the major tuna companies, and involved decreasing incidental dolphin kills by up to 50% by changing the type of nets used to catch tuna. The dolphins are netted only while fishermen are in pursuit of smaller tuna. Albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.[142]\\r\\nLoud underwater noises, such as those resulting from naval sonar use, live firing exercises, and certain offshore construction projects such as wind farms, may be harmful to dolphins, increasing stress, damaging hearing, and causing decompression sickness by forcing them to surface too quickly to escape the noise.[143][144]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins have long played a role in human culture. Dolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Greek myths, dolphins were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the Minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at Knossos. During the 2009 excavations of a major Mycenaean city at Iklaina, a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology, and many coins from ancient Greece have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin.[145] The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen.[146] In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. A dolphin rescued the poet Arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at Cape Matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus. There was a temple to Poseidon and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.[147]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greeks reimagined the Phoenician god Melqart as Melikerts (Melicertes) and made him the son of Athamas and Ino. He drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity Palaemon, while his mother became Leucothea. (cf Ino.) At Corinth, he was so closely connected with the cult of Poseidon that the Isthmian Games, originally instituted in Poseidon's honor, came to be looked upon as the funeral games of Melicertes. Phalanthus was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in Italy) on the back of a dolphin, according to Pausanias.\\r\\n\\r\\nDionysus was once captured by Etruscan pirates who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen heraldry developed in the Middle Ages, not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the stylised dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with fish scales.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are present in the coat of arms of Anguilla and the coat of arms of Romania,[148] and the coat of arms of Barbados has a dolphin supporter.[149][150]\\r\\n\\r\\nA well-known historical example of a dolphin in heraldry, was the arms for the former province of the Dauphin in southern France, from which were derived the arms and the title of the Dauphin of France, the heir to the former throne of France (the title literally means \\"The Dolphin of France\\").\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Dolfin\\" was the name of an aristocratic family in the maritime Republic of Venice, whose most prominent member was the 13th Century Doge Giovanni Dolfin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hindu mythology the Ganges River Dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river. The dolphin is said to be among the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens and her mount, the Makara, is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boto, a species of river dolphin that resides in the Amazon River, are believed to be shapeshifters, or encantados, who are capable of having children with human women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are comparatively few surviving myths of dolphins in Polynesian cultures, in spite of their maritime traditions and relevance of other marine animals such as sharks and seabirds; unlike these, they are more often perceived as food than as totemic symbols. Dolphins are most clearly represented in Rapa Nui Rongorongo, and in the traditions of the Caroline Islands they are depicted similarly to the Boto, being sexually active shapeshifters.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many dolphinaria around the world, making dolphins accessible to the public. Criticism and animal welfare laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. In the United States, the best known are the SeaWorld marine mammal parks.\\r\\nIn the Middle East the best known are Dolphin Bay at Atlantis, The Palm[153] and the Dubai Dolphinarium.[154]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins, false killer whales and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi in captivity.[155] An unusual and very rare hybrid dolphin, known as a wolphin, is kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale.[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of killer whales kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with 60 captive killer whales being held in aquaria as of  2017[update].[157] The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations such as the Mote Marine Laboratory rescue and rehabilitate sick, wounded, stranded or orphaned dolphins while others, such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, work on dolphin conservation and welfare. India has declared the dolphin as its national aquatic animal in an attempt to protect the endangered Ganges River Dolphin. The Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary has been created in the Ganges river for the protection of the animals.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is debate over the welfare of cetaceans in captivity, and often welfare can vary greatly dependent on the levels of care being provided at a particular facility. In the United States, facilities are regularly inspected by federal agencies to ensure that a high standard of welfare is maintained.[citation needed] Additionally, facilities can apply to become accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums(AZA), which (for accreditation) requires \\"the highest standards of animal care and welfare in the world\\" to be achieved. Facilities such as SeaWorld and the Georgia Aquarium are accredited by the AZA. Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60ÿ90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s, although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas, Corky II and Lolita, are in their mid-40s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70ÿ80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50ÿ60 years.[160] Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior. Wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres (100?mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.[161] Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress.[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough dolphins generally interact well with humans, some attacks have occurred, most of them resulting in small injuries.[163] Orcas, the largest species of dolphin, have been involved in fatal attacks on humans in captivity. The record-holder of documented orca fatal attacks is a male named Tilikum, who has lived at SeaWorld since 1992.[164][165][166] Tilikum has played a role in the death of three people in three different incidents (1991, 1999 and 2010).[167] Tilikum's behaviour sparked the production of the documentary Blackfish, which focuses on the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity. There are documented incidents in the wild, too, but none of them fatal.[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nFatal attacks from other species are less common, but there is a registered occurrence off the coast of Brazil in 1994, when a man died after being attacked by a bottlenose dolphin named Ti?o.[169][170] Ti?o had suffered harassment by human visitors, including attempts to stick ice cream sticks down her blowhole.[171] Non-fatal incidents occur more frequently, both in the wild and in captivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile dolphin attacks occur far less frequently than attacks by other sea animals, such as sharks, some scientists are worried about the careless programs of human-dolphin interaction. Dr. Andrew J. Read, a biologist at the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks, points out that dolphins are large and wild predators, so people should be more careful when they interact with them.[163]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral scientists who have researched dolphin behaviour have proposed that dolphins' unusually high intelligence in comparison to other animals means that dolphins should be seen as non-human persons who should have their own specific rights and that it is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes or to kill them either intentionally for consumption or unintentionally as by-catch.[172][173] Four countries ÿ Chile, Costa Rica, Hungary, and India ÿ have declared dolphins to be \\"non-human persons\\" and have banned the capture and import of live dolphins for entertainment.[174][175]\\r\\n\\r\\nA military dolphin is a dolphin trained for military uses. A number of militaries have employed dolphins for various purposes from finding mines to rescuing lost or trapped humans. The military use of dolphins, however, drew scrutiny during the Vietnam War when rumors circulated that the United States Navy was training dolphins to kill Vietnamese divers.[176] The United States Navy denies that at any point dolphins were trained for combat. Dolphins are still being trained by the United States Navy for other tasks as part of the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program. The Russian military is believed to have closed its marine mammal program in the early 1990s. In 2000 the press reported that dolphins trained to kill by the Soviet Navy had been sold to Iran.[177]\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphins are an increasingly popular choice of animal-assisted therapy for psychological problems and developmental disabilities. For example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression.[178] However, this study was criticized on several grounds. For example, it is not known whether dolphins are more effective than common pets.[179] Reviews of this and other published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords more than fleeting mood improvement.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some parts of the world, such as Taiji, Japan and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered as food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.[181]\\r\\nDolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide, which include Japan[182] and Peru (where it is referred to as chancho marino, or \\"sea pork\\").[183] While Japan may be the best-known and most controversial example, only a very small minority of the population has ever sampled it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat is located in a layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either horseradish or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver.[184]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of mercury.[185] There are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.[185]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Faroe Islands population was exposed to methylmercury largely from contaminated pilot whale meat, which contained very high levels of about 2 mg methylmercury/kg. However, the Faroe Islands populations also eat significant numbers of fish. The study of about 900 Faroese children showed that prenatal exposure to methylmercury resulted in neuropsychological deficits at 7 years of age\\r\\nConservation, research and news:\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotos:","input":"How many dolphins are born at a time?"},{"output":"the functions of a router, network switch, wireless access point and NAS as well as varied other functions","context":"The AirPort Extreme is a residential gateway product from Apple Inc. combining the functions of a router, network switch, wireless access point and NAS as well as varied other functions, and one of Apple's AirPort products.

The series focused on the lives of a group of teenage friends living in fictional Point Place, Wisconsin from May 17, 1976 to December 31, 1979.[1]\\r\\nThe main teenage cast members were Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon and Wilmer Valderrama. The main adult cast members were Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong and, in a limited role, Tanya Roberts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creators had wanted the show to have a 1970s \\"feel\\" from the beginning, so opted to set the series later in the decade, when trends and political ideologies had become firmly established and disseminated. The idea that the duration of the series would carry sociopolitical undertones also necessitated a chain of social events which could influence the characters. Thus, 1976 was chosen, which allowed episodes set within a short time frame to address streaking, the sexual revolution, the Equal Rights Amendment, the 1973 oil crisis, and the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, all of which were culturally influential events that occurred in the earlier years of the 1970s. The shift to 1977 during the last half of the first season also allowed the inclusion of a Star Wars episode (entitled \\"A New Hope\\"), as its May 1977 premiere airing roughly coincided with the May 1999 box-office debut of Star Wars: Episode I ÿ The Phantom Menace.\\r\\nThroughout the first two seasons, episodes opened with title cards showing the season/month and year (example: Late Spring, 1977 or June 1977). These, however, were largely abandoned after season 2, with few subsequent episodes using them. However, they were used again in the final episode, showing \\"December 31, 1979 10:45 a.m.\\" From the premiere onward, the episode's year could be determined by the registration tags on Eric's Vista Cruiser at the end of the opening and closing credits. The final episode's closing credits showed an \\"80\\" year tag.\\r\\nThe show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, \\"Grandma's Dead\\", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach \\"one\\" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.\\r\\nThe show's unexpected longevity (it was the only series to debut on Fox in 1998 to survive cancellation) combined with the first season jump to 1977 necessitated a slow-down of the series' timeline. Over time, this proved problematic from a narrative standpoint, as nearly every year featured a Thanksgiving and/or Christmas episode, and the teen-aged actors playing high-school student characters all aged into their mid-20s by the time their characters graduated from high school after five seasons (except Mila Kunis, who was not quite 20). As the series timeline sped up and slowed down with more rapidity near the series' climax, the timeline necessitated that several major events depicted as having occurred months apart would have in fact happened within weeks or even days of one another.\\r\\nThe timeline issues experienced on the show were not unprecedented, as other period-specific TV series have had similar issues. Most notably, M*A*S*H aired for 11 seasons despite the Korean War only lasting three years. Additionally, many TV series over the years that take place in the present time have characters age faster than normal while other characters age naturally.\\r\\nThe character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.[2] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.[2] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) and later returned for the finale. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was originally supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an \\"innocent character\\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop.[3] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers, was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.[4] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Judy Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle. Both Eric and Kelso returned for the series' final episode, although Topher Grace was uncredited.\\r\\nThe eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006,[5] and \\"That '70s Finale\\" was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.[6]\\r\\nThe show usually opens with the theme song, \\"In the Street\\", written by Alex Chilton and Chris Bell of the band Big Star. The original version of the song appeared on Big Star's 1972 debut album #1 Record. In 2000, Chilton confirmed that he was paid $70 in royalties each time the show aired, an amount he thought ironic, given the show's title.[7]\\r\\nBig Star's original version of the song was not used on the show. Instead, a cover version sung by Todd Griffin was used as the theme song for the show's first season. Beginning in the second season, the theme song was performed by the band Cheap Trick. Unlike previous versions of the song, Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase \\"We're all alright!\\" quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song \\"Surrender\\".[8]\\r\\nBoth versions of the song (Todd Griffin and Cheap Trick) used on the show end with somebody yelling \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\" In Griffin's version, Masterson is the one yelling \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\"[9] while it is unknown who yells it in Cheap Trick's version during the opening. On the soundtrack, That '70s Album (Rockin'), Cheap Trick's lead singer Robin Zander yells \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\"[10] Alternate holiday versions of the theme song were arranged for Halloween and Christmas specials, using organ music and bells, respectively.\\r\\nOpening credits for seasons 1ÿ7 showed members of the cast driving in Eric's car singing the theme song together. At the conclusion of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening).\\r\\nAfter Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, Mila Kunis \\"Hanging Out...;\\" Danny Masterson \\"Down the Street\\"). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were Kurtwood Smith and Tommy Chong, with the exception of the first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last \\"We're all alright\\". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong looks around the room, confused as he hears \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\" The final episode omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.\\r\\nThe show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as sexism, sexual attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers and teenage drug use, including underage drinking. The series also highlighted developments in the entertainment industry, including the television remote (\\"the clicker\\"), reruns, VCR, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with Star Wars.[11] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.[12]\\r\\nBeginning with the second season, the show focused less on the sociopolitical aspects of the story. For example, the dynamic of the relationship between Eric and Donna was altered in later seasons to more closely resemble the relationships of other \\"power couples\\" on teen dramas. Likewise, the first season of the show featured a recurring, more dramatic storyline in which the Formans were in danger of losing their home due to Red's hours being cut back at the auto parts plant where he worked. Storylines in later seasons were generally presented more comically and less dramatically.\\r\\nThe show also featured guest-starring actors from 1970s TV shows, such as Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Betty White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Tom Poston and Jack Riley (The Bob Newhart Show), Pamela Sue Martin (The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries), Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman (WKRP in Cincinnati), Eve Plumb, Barry Williams and Christopher Knight (The Brady Bunch), Tom Bosley and Marion Ross (Happy Days), Monty Hall (Let's Make A Deal), Gavin MacLeod (The Love Boat and The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Don Knotts, Richard Kline and Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company), and Danny Bonaduce and Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family). Series recurring cast member Tanya Roberts also starred in a popular show in the 1970s (Charlie's Angels).\\r\\nBeginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (Season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled \\"That '70s Finale\\").\\r\\nOne device in the show is to present a split screen in which two pairs of characters speak. One character is usually seeking advice on a problem with a character in the second pairing and the other character advises them. Although the conversations appear to mirror each other, notable differences often occur. It is most often used by the couples of the show, with each member of the couple being advised on the relationship. For example, in the episode \\"Who Wants It More?\\", Donna and Eric tell Jackie and Hyde that they have been holding out on each other sexually for three days and that maybe they should cave. Both Jackie and Hyde tell Donna and Eric not to cave or the \\"caver\\" will be owned by the other.\\r\\nThe show includes character daydream sequences, some of which refer to or parody fads and films of the time, such as Star Wars, Rocky, and Grease.\\r\\nThe character picturing the dream sometimes also narrates it, but regardless, the other characters present see the same dream. In the episode \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\", Jackie mentioned she liked the song playing in Fez's dream sequence. The sequences are usually introduced by a wobbling screen transition. Sometimes, the transition is absent when the characters who imagine the scene believe they are real (for example, Eric's dream about Donna in \\"Eric's Birthday\\" or Jackie's dream about Hyde proposing in \\"It's All Over Now\\").\\r\\nIn the 100th episode, \\"That '70s Musical\\", all singing scenes were Fez's dream sequences.\\r\\nIn the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as he or she speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the \\"drug-induced\\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word \\"marijuana\\" while in the circle (except in one episode \\"Reefer Madness\\"), often referring to it as \\"stuff\\" or a \\"stash\\". In the episode \\"Bye-Bye Basement\\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \\"weed\\"; in \\"The Relapse\\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \\"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\\" in \\"Ski Trip\\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \\"Eric's Burger Job\\", Kelso blames his \\"roach clip\\" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (\\"That Wrestling Show\\" and \\"Hyde Moves In\\") Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \\"Cannabis Sativa\\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \\"The Pill\\" Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \\"That kid's on dope!\\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.\\r\\nAs the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are \\"Class Picture\\", \\"I'm A Boy\\", \\"Substitute\\", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.\\r\\nThe stupid helmet refers to a replica of a Green Bay Packers helmet that a character is forced to wear after having done or said something deemed stupid by the rest of the gang. Eric had to wear it when he said he wanted to propose to Donna and Fez wore it when he started banging his head on the table after trying to help Kelso keep Jackie. The helmet can be seen in the Forman basement on a shelf behind the cast. When the series concluded in 2006, the last one up the staircase had to call Red a \\"dumbass\\", something he always called the kids. Since Kelso was the last one up, he grabbed the helmet.\\r\\nIn many episodes, the teenaged characters often hang out on a local water tower. At the end of several water tower segments, at least one character falls off (usually Kelso). When Charlie Richardson (played by Bret Harrison) fell off and died in season 8, the water tower was renamed in his honor.\\r\\nAfter Charlie's death, Kelso fell off again, but survived, leading him to believe he was \\"invincible\\". In the \\"Water Tower episode\\", the gang painted a marijuana leaf on the tower, but it looked more like a green hand giving the finger. In the episode \\"The Immigrant Song (a.k.a. Fez Gets Busted)\\" Kelso paints Jackie and his names on the tower to annoy Hyde just before falling and ending up in the hospital. During this episode, Fez paints his manhood on the tower but only gets as far as drawing a circle when the police arrive to arrest him. Kelso was known to fall off the water tower once in every grade since middle school. Jackie and Fez share their first official kiss on the tower in the show's finale.\\r\\nIn the first season, scene transitions (also known as bumpers) consisted of animated smiley buttons[13] or still images of faces from the 1970s with only the mouth moving using Syncro-Vox, usually yelling, in a rock form, \\"Yeahhh!\\" or something similar (ex. Farrah Fawcett saying \\"Yeah!\\" or Richard Nixon saying \\"Are you ready to rock and roll?\\") The smiley buttons were removed for re-runs and home video, replaced with flowers likewise exploding, replicating, deflating or bouncing around. Sometimes they would be visuals of lava lamps with the show's logo plummeting to the bottom of the screen in front of it.\\r\\nBeginning in season 2, transitions featured the characters doing something in front of a colorful, psychedelic, lava lamp-like background. These transitions featured the most prominent characters of the episode usually dancing, falling or making facial expressions. The music accompanying these colorful sequences would match the tone of the episode and characters.\\r\\nBy the show's final season, new transitions were created to accommodate cast changes (e.g. Donna's hair color, Leo continuing as a series regular and the insertion of Randy).\\r\\n\\"Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)\\" is the only episode where Laurie Forman is featured in a transition. Tanya Roberts is the only regular actor not to be featured in a transition.\\r\\nMany of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \\"Aztec Gold\\" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.\\r\\nThe show's pronunciation of \\"Vista Cruiser\\", with emphasis on \\"Cruiser\\" conflicted with the pronunciation of author George Plimpton in the Oldsmobile television advertisement for the 1969 Vista Cruiser, where he pronounced the two words with the emphasis on \\"Vista\\".[14]\\r\\nThat particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for US$500.[15]\\r\\nIn August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.[16]\\r\\nIn one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of \\"kicking your ass\\". For example, in \\"Kitty and Eric's Night Out\\", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, \\"I swear I'll kick his ass!\\" In \\"Eric's Hot Cousin\\", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, \\"And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass\\", and, in \\"Prank Day\\", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone \\"horribly, horribly wrong\\" Red says, \\"Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!\\" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.\\r\\nSome other notable running gags are:\\r\\nIn 1999, the show was remade by the ITV network in the United Kingdom as Days Like These using almost verbatim scripts with minor changes to cultural references.[23]\\r\\nThat '70s Show was released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 by Fox Home Entertainment at an increment of two seasons per year between 2004 and 2008 and a complete series release on October 14, 2008. Mill Creek Entertainment released all eight seasons between 2011 and '13 and released a complete series set on May 14, 2013. On March 6, 2012, Mill Creek released the first season on Blu-ray and season two on October 16, 2012. On November 3, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment released That '70s Show The Complete Series on Blu-ray 1080p with 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio.[24]\\r\\nSeveral prominent songs from the decade can be heard on the series, and two soundtracks were released in 1999. The first is a collection of funk, soul, and disco, called That '70s Album (Jammin'). The second is a collection of album-oriented rock songs, called That '70s Album (Rockin'). AllMusic gave both albums 3 out of 5 stars in their reviews.[25][26]\\r\\nOver the course of its run, the series was a consistent performer for Fox, becoming one of their flagship shows. Its eight seasons, consisting of 200 episodes, made it Fox's second-longest-running live-action sitcom ever behind Married... with Children, though That '70s Show did not have the same ratings success.\\r\\nOver the course of its run, the series was nominated for a substantial number of awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. The only win for the series at this event came in 1999, when Melina Root was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series for \\"That Disco Episode\\". Additionally, the show was nominated for a large number of Teen Choice Awards, with both Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama winning on three occasions.\\r\\n Media related to That '70s Show at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When did that 70's show first air?"},{"output":"2.5ÿ2.75%","context":"Fresh water is naturally occurring water on Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and underground as groundwater in aquifers and underground streams. Fresh water is generally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids. The term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water although it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs. The term \\"sweet water\\" (from Spanish \\"agua dulce\\") has been used to describe fresh water in contrast to salt water. The term \\"fresh water\\" does not have the same meaning as potable water. Much of the surface fresh water and ground water is unsuitable for drinking without some form of purification because of the presence of chemical or biological contaminants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water habitats are divided into lentic systems, which are the stillwaters including ponds, lakes, swamps and mires; lotic, or running-water systems; and groundwater which flows in rocks and aquifers. There is, in addition, a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems, which is the hyporheic zone, which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel. It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water. The majority of fresh water on Earth is in ice caps.\\r\\nThe source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\r\\nIn coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rain-bearing clouds. This can give rise to elevated concentrations of sodium, chloride, magnesium and sulfate as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations.\\r\\nIn desert areas, or areas with impoverished or dusty soils, rain-bearing winds can pick up sand and dust and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils. Significant quantities of iron may be transported in this way including the well-documented transfer of iron-rich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sand-storms in the Sahara in north Africa.\\r\\nWater is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms. Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most mammals must have access to fresh water to live. Some terrestrial mammals, especially desert rodents appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the metabolism of cereal seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree.\\r\\nOut of all the water on Earth, saline water in oceans, seas and saline groundwater make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5ÿ2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75ÿ2% frozen in glaciers, ice and snow, 0.5ÿ0.75% as fresh groundwater and soil moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers.[2][3] Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the African Great Lakes, 22% in Lake Baikal in Russia, 21% in the North American Great Lakes, and 14% in other lakes. Swamps have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the Amazon River. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water.[4] In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, fresh water derived from precipitation may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in ice sheets. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.\\r\\nFresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 parts per million (ppm) of dissolved salts.[5]\\r\\nOther sources give higher upper salinity limits for fresh water, e.g. 1000 ppm[6] or 3000 ppm.[7]\\r\\nFresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney.[8] Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The eel (Anguilla anguilla) uses the hormone prolactin,[9] while in salmon (Salmo salar) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.[10]\\r\\nMany sea birds have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted. Similarly the marine iguanas on the Galpagos Islands excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.\\r\\nAn important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum streamflow, especially preserving and restoring instream water allocations.[11] Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all ecosystems. The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on down-stream ecosystems. Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage eco-systems.\\r\\nPollution from human activity, including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources. The largest petroleum spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a Royal Dutch Shell tank ship in Magdalena, Argentina, on 15 January 1999, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals.[12]\\r\\nFresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0.003% of total water available globally.[13]\\r\\nChanging landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water. Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water. As a result, more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most fresh water,[14] this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems. In Australia, over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.[14] With regards to agriculture, the World Bank targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate.[15]\\r\\nFresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource. Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle, in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and reservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation. Locally however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments.\\r\\nFresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose, excluding evaporation losses. Water drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream.\\r\\nThe increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources avialability of clean fresh water The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components: water quality, water quantity or volume, and water timing. A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well.[16] Water pollution and subsequent eutrophication also reduces the availability of fresh water.[17]\\r\\nMany areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability. Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the human population as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall health and the production of grain.[18]\\r\\nWith one in eight people in the world not having access to safe water[19] it is important to use this resource in a prudent manner. Making the best use of water on a local basis probably provides the best solution. Local communities need to plan their use of fresh water and should be made aware of how certain crops and animals use water.\\r\\nAs a guide the following tables provide some indicators.\\r\\nTable 1 Recommended basic water requirements for human needs (per person) [20]\\r\\nTable 2.

Regina had previously been raped by a man named D.J. Pratt, but had not sought to press charges against him at the time, in spite of the forensic evidence that linked him to the crime.  Regina is raped by Pratt a second time later on, and she seeks out Aiden's help.  Unfortunately for Regina, Pratt left no evidence of the assault this time, but Regina is adamant about pressing charges against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAiden pulls the evidence gathered from the first rape, which includes one of Pratt's hairs.

The first traces of permanent settlement, ushering in the Archaic period, appear about 5,500 years ago (Mound Builders).\\r\\nThe area formed part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. The Marksville culture emerged about 2,000 years ago out of the earlier Tchefuncte culture. It is considered ancestral to the Natchez and Taensa peoples. About 1,000 years ago, the Mississippian culture emerged from the Woodland period. The emergence of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex coincides with the adoption of maize agriculture and chiefdom-level complex social organization beginning in c. 1200 AD. The Mississippian culture mostly disappeared before the 16th century, with the exception of some Natchez communities that maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.\\r\\nEuropean influence began in the 16th century, and La Louisiane (named after Louis XIV of France) became a colony of the Kingdom of France in 1682, before passing to Spain in 1763. It became part of the United States following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Antebellum Louisiana was a leading slave state; in 1860, 47% of the population was enslaved. Louisiana seceded from the Union (American Civil War) on 26 January 1861. New Orleans, the largest city in the entire South and strategically important as a port city, was taken by Union troops on 25 April 1862.\\r\\nDuring the Reconstruction Era, Louisiana was part of the Fifth Military District. In 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new disfranchising constitution, whose effects were immediate and long-lasting. The disfranchisement of African Americans did not end until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dalton Tradition is a Late Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic projectile point tradition, appearing in much of Southeast North America around 8500ÿ7900 BC.\\r\\nDuring the Archaic period, Louisiana was home to the earliest mound complex in North America and one of the earliest dated complex constructions in the Americas. The Watson Brake site is an arrangement of human-made mounds located in the floodplain of the Ouachita River near Monroe in northern Louisiana. It has been dated to about 3400 BC. The site appears to have been abandoned about 2800.[1]\\r\\nBy 2200, during the Late Archaic period the Poverty Point culture occupied much of Louisiana and was spread into several surrounding states. Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites, including the Jaketown Site near Belzoni, Mississippi. The largest and best-known site is near modern-day Epps, Louisiana at Poverty Point. The Poverty Point culture may have hit its peak around 1500, making it the first complex culture, and possibly the first tribal culture, not only in the Mississippi Delta but in the present-day United States. Its people were in villages that extended for nearly 100 miles across the Mississippi River.[2] It lasted until approximately 700 BCE.\\r\\nThe Poverty Point culture was followed by the Tchefuncte and Lake Cormorant cultures of the Tchula period, local manifestations of Early Woodland period. These descendant cultures differed from Poverty Point culture in trading over shorter distances, creating less massive public projects, completely adopting ceramics for storage and cooking. The Tchefuncte culture were the first people in Louisiana to make large amounts of pottery. Ceramics from the Tchefuncte culture have been found in sites from eastern Texas to eastern Florida, and from coastal Louisiana to southern Arkansas.[3] These cultures lasted until 200 AD.\\r\\nThe Middle Woodland period started in Louisiana with the Marksville culture in the southern and eastern part of the state[4] and the Fourche Maline culture in the northwestern part of the state. The Marksville culture takes its name from the Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. These cultures were contemporaneous with the Hopewell cultures of Ohio and Illinois, and participated in the Hopewell Exchange Network.\\r\\nAt this time populations became more sedentary and began to establish semi-permanent villages and to practice agriculture,[5] planting various cultigens of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. The populations began to expand, and trade with various non-local peoples also began to increase. Trade with peoples to the southwest brought the bow and arrow[6] An increase in the hierarchical structuring of their societies began during this period, although it is not clear whether it was internally developed or borrowed from the Hopewell. The dead were treated in increasingly elaborate ways, as the first burial mounds are built at this time.[5] Political power begins to be consolidated; the first platform mounds and ritual centers were constructed as part of the development of a hereditary political and religious leadership.[5]\\r\\nBy 400 AD in the eastern part of the state, the Late Woodland period had begun with the Baytown and Troyville cultures (named for the Troyville Earthworks in Jonesville, Louisiana), and later the Coles Creek culture. Archaeologists have traditionally viewed the Late Woodland as a time of cultural decline after the florescence of the Hopewell peoples. Late Woodland sites, with the exception of sites along the Florida Gulf Coast, tend to be small when compared with Middle Woodland sites. Although settlement size was small, there was an increase in the number of Late Woodland sites over Middle Woodland sites, indicating a population increase. These factors tend to mark the Late Woodland period as an expansive period, not one of a cultural collapse.[7] Where the Baytown peoples began to build more dispersed settlements, the Troyville people instead continued building major earthwork centers.[8] The type site for the culture, the Troyville Earthworks, once had the second tallest precolumbian mound in North America and the tallest in Louisiana at 82 feet (25?m) in height.[9]\\r\\nThe Coles Creek culture from 700 to 1200 AD marks a significant change in the cultural history of the area. Population increased dramatically, and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity, especially by the end of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of chiefdom societies are not yet manifested, by 1000 CE the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Coles Creek sites are found in present-day Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Texas. Many Coles Creek sites were erected over earlier Woodland period mortuary mounds, leading researchers to speculate that emerging elites were symbolically and physically appropriating dead ancestors to emphasize and project their own authority.[10]\\r\\nThe Mississippian period in Louisiana saw the emergence of the Plaquemine and Caddoan Mississippian cultures. This was the period when extensive maize agriculture was adopted. The Plaquemine culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana began in 1200 AD and continued until about 1600 AD. Good examples of this culture are the Medora Site (the type site for the culture and period), Fitzhugh Mounds, Transylvania Mounds, and Scott Place Mounds in Louisiana and the Anna, Emerald, Winterville and Holly Bluff sites located in Mississippi.[11] Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture at the Cahokia site near St. Louis, Missouri. By 1000 AD in the northwestern part of the state the Fourche Maline culture had evolved into the Caddoan Mississippian culture. By 1400 AD Plaquemine had started to hybridize through contact with Middle Mississippian cultures to the north and became what archaeologist term Plaquemine Mississippian. These peoples are considered ancestral to historic groups encountered by the first Europeans in the area, the Natchez and Taensa peoples.[12] The Caddoan Mississippians covered a large territory, including what is now eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, northeast Texas, and northwest Louisiana. Archaeological evidence that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present, and that the direct ancestors of the Caddo and related Caddo language speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact and the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma is unquestioned today.[13] Significant Caddoan Mississippian archaeological sites in Louisiana include Belcher Mound Site in Caddo Parish[14] and Gahagan Mounds Site in Red River Parish.[15]\\r\\nThe following groups are known to have inhabited the state's territory when the Europeans began colonization:[16]\\r\\nMany current place names in the state, including Atchafalaya, Natchitouches (now spelled Natchitoches), Caddo, Houma, Tangipahoa, and Avoyel (as Avoyelles), are transliterations of those used in various Native American languages.\\r\\nThe first European explorers to visit Louisiana came in 1528 when a Spanish expedition led by Panfilo de Narvez located the mouth of the Mississippi River. In 1542, Hernando de Soto's expedition skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and Tunica groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the Gulf of Mexico in 1543. The expedition encountered hostile tribes all along river. Natives followed the boats in large canoes, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days on end as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish, whose crossbows had long ceased working, had no effective offensive weapons on the water and were forced to rely on their remaining armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded. Neither of the explorations made any claims to the territory for Spain.\\r\\nEuropean interest in Louisiana was dormant until the late 17th century, when French expeditions, which had imperial, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast. With its first settlements, France lay claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico through Canada. It was also establishing settlements in Canada, from the Maritimes westward along the St. Lawrence River and into the region surrounding the Great Lakes.\\r\\nThe French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle named the region Louisiana in 1682 to honor France's King Louis XIV. The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at what is now Ocean Springs, Mississippi, near Biloxi), was founded in 1699 by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, a French military officer from Canada.\\r\\nThe French colony of Louisiana originally claimed all the land on both sides of the Mississippi River and north to French territory in Canada around the Great Lakes. A royal ordinance of 1722following the transfer of the Illinois Country's governance from Canada to Louisianamay have featured the broadest definition of the region: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies[17]\\r\\nA generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general Vaudreuil set the northern and eastern bounds of his domain as the Wabash valley up to the mouth of the Vermilion River (near present-day Danville, Illinois); from there, northwest to le Rocher on the Illinois River, and from there west to the mouth of the Rock River (at present day Rock Island, Illinois).[17] Thus, Vincennes and Peoria were the limit of Louisiana'a reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near present-day Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien operated as dependencies of Canada.[17]\\r\\nThis boundary between Canada and Louisiana remained in effect until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, after which France surrendered its remaining territory east of the Mississippiexcept for New Orleansto Great Britain. (Although British forces had occupied the \\"Canadian\\" posts in the Illinois and Wabash countries in 1761, they did not occupy Vincennes or the Mississippi River settlements at Cahokia and Kaskaskia until 1764, after the ratification of the peace treaty.[18]) As part of a general report on conditions in the newly conquered lands, Gen. Thomas Gage, then commandant at Montreal, explained in 1762 that, although the boundary between Louisiana and Canada wasn't exact, it was understood the upper Mississippi above the mouth of the Illinois was in Canadian trading territory.[19] The French established an important and lucrative fur trade in the northern areas, which became increasingly important. It competed with the Dutch, and later English, across the northern tier for fur trade with the Native Americans. The fur trade also helped cement alliances between Europeans and Native American tribes.\\r\\nThe settlement of Natchitoches (along the Red River in present-day northwest Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent settlement in the territory that then composed the Louisiana colony. The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road (sometimes called El Camino Real, or Kings Highway)which ended at Nachitochesand to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads. Sugar cane plantations were developed first. In the nineteenth century, cotton plantations were developed along the river. Over time, planters developed large plantations but also lived in fine homes in a growing town, a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places.\\r\\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts. They were concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the Illinois Country, in modern-day Indiana, Illinois and Missouri.\\r\\nInitially Mobile, and (briefly) Biloxi served the capital of the colony. In 1722, recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, France made New Orleans the seat of civilian and military authority. The Illinois Country exported its grain surpluses down the Mississippi to New Orleans, which climate could not support their cultivation. The lower country of Louisiana (modern-day Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana) depended on the Illinois French for survival through much of the eighteenth century.\\r\\nEuropean settlement in the Louisiana colony was not exclusively French; in the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River in a region referred to as the German Coast.\\r\\nIn 1719, two French ships arrived in New Orleans, the Duc du Maine and the Aurore, carrying the first African slaves to Louisiana for labor.[20][21] From 1718 to 1750, traders transported thousands of captive Africans to Louisiana from the Senegambian coast, the west African region of the interior of modern Benin, and from the coast of modern Democratic Republic of the Congo-Angola border. French shipping records contained much more details about slaves' origins than did those in the English colonies. Researchers have found that approximately 2000 persons originated from the upper West African slave ports from Saint-Louis, Senegal to Cap Appolonia (present-day bri Lagoon, C?te d'Ivoire) several hundred kilometers to the south; an additional 2000 were exported from the port of Whydah (modern Ouidah, Benin); and roughly 300 departed from Cabinda.[22]\\r\\nGwendolyn Midlo-Hall has argued that, due to historical and administrative ties between France and Senegal, \\"Two-thirds of the slaves brought to Louisiana by the French slave trade came from Senegambia.\\"[23] This assertion is not universally accepted. This region between the Senegal and Gambia rivers had peoples who were closely related through history: three of the principal languages, Sereer, Wolof and Pulaar were related, and Malinke, spoken by the Mande people to the east, was \\"mutually intelligible\\" with them. Midlo-Hall says that this concentration of peoples from one region of Africa strongly shaped Louisiana Creole culture.[23]\\r\\nPeter Caron says that the geographic and perhaps linguistic connection among many African captives did not necessarily imply developing a common culture in Louisiana. They likely differed in religions. Some slaves from Senegambia were Muslims while most followed their traditional spiritual practices. Many were likely captives taken in the Islamic jihads that engulfed the region from Futa Djallon to Futa Toro and Futa Bundu (modern Upper Niger River) in the early 18th century.[22] The inland territories of the African continent from which slaves were captured, were enormous. Commentators may have attributed more similarities to slaves taken from among these areas than the Africans recognized among themselves at the time.[24]\\r\\nFrance was forced to cede most of its territory east of the Mississippi to the Kingdom of Great Britain after its defeat in the Seven Years' War. The area around New Orleans and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, along with the rest of Louisiana, became a possession of Spain after the Seven Years' War by the Treaty of Paris of 1763.\\r\\nSpanish rule did not affect the pace of francophone immigration to the territory, which increased due to the English expulsion of the Acadians from Canada. Several thousand French-speaking refugees from Acadia (now Nova Scotia, Canada) migrated to Louisiana after expulsion by the newly ascendant British, after conflicts in Canada. The first group of around 200 arrived in 1765, led by Joseph Broussard (called \\"Beausoleil\\").[25] They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called Acadiana. The Acadian refugees were welcomed by the Spanish as additions of Catholic population. Their descendants came to be called Cajuns.\\r\\nMany Spanish-speaking immigrants arrived such as the Canary Islanders of Spain, which are known as the Isle?os and Andalusians from the south of Spain called Malague?os. The Isle?os and Malague?os immigrated to Louisiana between 1778 and 1783. The Isle?os settled in southeast Louisiana mainly in St. Bernard Parish, just outside of New Orleans, as well as near the area just below Baton Rouge. The Malague?os settled mainly around New Iberia, but some spread to other parts of southern Louisiana.\\r\\nBoth free and enslaved populations increased rapidly during the years of Spanish rule, as new settlers and Creoles imported large numbers of slaves to work on plantations. Although some American settlers brought slaves with them who were native to Virginia or North Carolina, the Pointe Coupee inventories of the late eighteenth century showed that most slaves brought by traders came directly from Africa. In 1763 settlements from New Orleans to Pointe Coupee (north of Baton Rouge) included 3,654 free persons and 4,598 slaves. By the 1800 census, which included West Florida, there were 19,852 free persons and 24,264 slaves in Lower Louisiana. Although the censuses do not always cover the same territory, the slaves became the majority of the population during these years. Records during Spanish rule were not as well documented as with the French slave trade, making it difficult to trace African origins. The volume of slaves imported from Africa resulted in what historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall called \\"the re-Africanization\\" of Lower Louisiana, which strongly influenced the culture.[26]\\r\\nIn 1800, France's Napoleon Bonaparte reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for some two years. Documents have revealed that he harbored secret ambitions to reconstruct a large colonial empire in the Americas. This notion faltered, however, after the French attempt to reconquer Saint-Domingue after its revolution ended in failure, with the loss of two-thirds of the more than 20,000 troops sent to the island to suppress the revolution. After French withdrawal in 1803, Haiti declared its independence in 1804 as the second republic in the Western Hemisphere.\\r\\nAs a result of his setbacks, Napoleon gave up his dreams of American empire and sold Louisiana (New France) to the United States. The U.S. divided the land into two territories: the Territory of Orleans, which became the state of Louisiana in 1812, and the District of Louisiana, which consisted of the vast lands not included in the Orleans Territory, extending west of the Mississippi River north to Canada. The Florida Parishes were annexed from the short-lived and strategically important Republic of West Florida, by proclamation of President James Madison in 1810.\\r\\nThe Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) resulted in a major emigration of refugees to Louisiana, where they settled chiefly in New Orleans. The thousands of Haitian immigrants included many free people of color, whites, and enslaved Africans. Some refugees had earlier gone to Cuba, and came from Cuba in another wave of immigration in 1809. The free people of color added substantially to the Creoles of color community in New Orleans and white Haitian immigrants added substantially to the French Creole community of New Orleans. These immigrants enlarged the French-speaking community.[27]\\r\\nIn 1811, the largest slave revolt in American history, the German Coast Uprising, took place in the Orleans Territory. Between 64 and 500 slaves rose up on the \\"German Coast,\\" forty miles upriver of New Orleans, and marched to within 20 miles (32?km) of the city gates. All of the limited number of U.S. troops were gathered to suppress the revolt, as well as citizen militias.\\r\\nLouisiana became a U.S. state on April 30, 1812. The western boundary of Louisiana with Spanish Texas remained in dispute until the Adams-Ons Treaty of 1819, which was formally ratified in 1821,[28] The area referred to as the Sabine Free State serving as a neutral buffer zone, as well as a haven for criminals. Also called \\"No Man's Land,\\" this part of central and southwestern Louisiana was settled in part by a mixed-race people known as Redbones.\\r\\nWith the growth of settlement in the Midwest (formerly the Northwest Territory) and Deep South during the early decades of the 19th century, trade and shipping increased markedly in New Orleans. Produce and products moved out of the Midwest down the Mississippi River for shipment overseas, and international ships docked at New Orleans with imports to send into the interior. The port was crowded with steamboats, flatboats, and sailing ships, and workers speaking languages from many nations. New Orleans was the major port for the export of cotton and sugar. The city's population grew and the region became quite wealthy. More than the rest of the Deep South, it attracted immigrants for the many jobs in the city. The richest citizens imported fine goods of wine, furnishings, and fabrics.\\r\\nBy 1840 New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy. It had become one of the wealthiest cities and the third-largest city in the nation.[29] The ban on importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market. During these decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved African Americans underwent forced migration from the Upper South to the Deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade. Others were transported by slaveholders as they moved west for new lands.[30][31]\\r\\nWith changing agriculture in the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers. Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the coastwise slave trade. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.\\r\\nWith its plantation economy, Louisiana was a state that generated wealth from the labor of and trade in enslaved Africans. It also had one of the largest free black populations in the United States, totaling 18,647 people in 1860. Most of the free blacks (or free people of color, as they were called in the French tradition) lived in the New Orleans region and southern part of the state. More than in other areas of the South, most of the free people of color were of mixed race. Many gens du couleur libre in New Orleans were middle class and educated; many were property owners. By contrast, according to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, nearly 47% of the state's total population of 708,002.[32]\\r\\nConstruction and elaboration of the levee system was critical to the state's ability to cultivate its commodity crops of cotton and sugar cane. Enslaved Africans built the first levees under planter direction. Later levees were expanded, heightened and added to mostly by Irish immigrant laborers, whom contractors hired when doing work for the state. As the 19th century progressed, the state had an interest in ensuring levee construction. By 1860, Louisiana had built 740 miles (1,190?km) of levees on the Mississippi River and another 450 miles (720?km) of levees on its outlets. These immense earthworks were built mostly by hand. They averaged six feet in height, and up to twenty feet in some areas.[33]\\r\\nEnfranchised elite whites' strong economic interest in maintaining the slave system contributed to Louisiana's decision to secede from the Union in 1861. It followed other Southern states in seceding after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States. Louisiana's secession was announced on January 26, 1861, and it became part of the Confederate States of America.\\r\\nThe state was quickly defeated in the Civil War, a result of Union strategy to cut the Confederacy in two by seizing the Mississippi. Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862. Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the Federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under Federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives to the U.S. Congress.\\r\\nFollowing the Civil War, much of the South, including Louisiana, was placed under the supervision of military governors under northern command. Louisiana was grouped with Texas in what was administered as the Fifth Military District. Under this period of Reconstruction Era, the slaves were freed and males were given suffrage. African Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both freedmen and people of color who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat. White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in Ku Klux Klan chapters.\\r\\nIn the 1870s, whites accelerated their insurgency to regain control of political power in the state. The Red River area, where new parishes had been created by the Reconstruction legislature, was an area of conflict. On Easter Sunday 1873, an estimated 85 to more than 100 blacks were killed in the Colfax massacre, as white militias had gathered to challenge Republican officeholders after the disputed gubernatorial election of 1872.\\r\\nParamilitary groups such as the White League, formed in 1874, used violence and outright assassination to turn Republicans out of office, and intimidate African Americans and suppress black voting, control their work, and limit geographic movement in an effort to control labor. Among violent acts attributed to the White League in 1874 was the Coushatta massacre, where they killed six Republican officeholders, including four family members of the local state senator, and twenty freedmen as witnesses.[34]\\r\\nLater, 5,000 White Leaguers battled 3,500 members of the Metropolitan Police and state militia in New Orleans after demanding the resignation of Governor William Pitt Kellogg. They hoped to replace him with the Democratic candidate of the disputed 1872 elections, John McEnery. The White League briefly took over the statehouse and city hall before Federal troops arrived.[35] In 1876, the white Democrats regained control of Louisiana.\\r\\nThrough the 1880s, white Democrats began to reduce voter registration of blacks and poor whites by making registration and elections more complicated. They imposed institutionalized forms of racial discrimination and also conducted voter intimidation and violence against black Republicans. The rate of lynchings of blacks increased through the century, reaching a peak in the late 1800s, but with lynchings continuing well into the 20th century. Blacks came out in force in the April 1896 elections, in areas where they could freely vote, to support a Republican-Populist fusion ticket that might overturn the conservative Democrats. Blacks were threatened by increasing talk about restricting their vote, and Mississippi had already passed a new constitution in 1890 that disenfranchised most blacks. Racial tensions and violence were high, and there were 21 lynchings of blacks in Louisiana that year, surpassing the total for any state. Returns from Democratic-controlled plantation parishes were doctored, and the Democrats won the race. The legislature \\"refused to investigate what everyone knew was a stolen election.\\"[36]\\r\\nIn 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new disenfranchising constitution, with provisions for voter registration, such as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests, to raise barriers to black voter registration, as Mississippi had successfully done. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.[37]\\r\\nThe state population in 1900 was 47% African-American: 652,013 citizens, of whom many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizable population of blacks free before the Civil War.[38] By 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state. Because of disenfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color.[39] White Democrats had established one-party rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided federal enforcement of the constitutional right to vote.\\r\\nIn the notable 19th-century U.S. Supreme Court decision Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the Court ruled that \\"separate but equal\\" facilities were constitutional. The lawsuit, based on restricted seating in interstate passenger trains, was brought from Louisiana with strong support from the Creoles of color community in New Orleans: Plessy was one. Separation through segregation, however, resulted everywhere in lesser services and facilities for blacks.\\r\\nFrom July 24-27, 1900, New Orleans erupted in a white race riot after Robert Charles, an African-American laborer, fatally shot a white police officer during an altercation. He escaped and during and after the manhunt for him, whites rampaged through the city attacking other blacks and burning down two black schools. A total of 28 people died, including Charles, and more than 50 were wounded. Most of the casualties were black. The riot received national attention and ended only with intervention by state militia.[40]\\r\\nAs a result of disfranchisement, African Americans in Louisiana essentially had no representation; as they could not vote, they could not participate in juries or in local, state or federal offices. As a result, they suffered inadequate funding for schools and services, and lack of attention to their interests and worse in the segregated state. They continued to build their own lives and institutions.\\r\\nIn 1915, the Supreme Court struck down the grandfather clause in its ruling in Guinn v. United States. Although the case originated in Oklahoma, Louisiana and other Southern states had used similar clauses to exempt white voters from literacy tests. State legislators quickly passed new requirements for potential voters to demonstrate \\"understanding,\\" or reading comprehension, to official registrars. Administered subjectively by whites, in practice the understanding test was used to keep most black voters off the rolls. By 1923, Louisiana established the all-white primary, which effectively shut out the few black voters from the Democratic Party, the only competitive part of elections in the one-party state.[41]\\r\\nIn the middle decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities. The boll weevil infestation and agricultural problems had cost sharecroppers and farmers their jobs, and continuing violence drove out many families. The mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for many farm laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the burgeoning defense industry in California in the 1940s, better education for their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote, as well as an escape from southern violence.[42]\\r\\nDuring some of this period, Louisiana accepted Catholic orphans in an urban resettlement program organized in New York City. Opelousas was a destination for at least three of the Orphan Trains which carried orphan children out of New York from 1854ÿ1929. It was the heart of a traditional Catholic region of French, Spanish, Acadian, African and French West Indian heritage and traditions. Families in Louisiana took in more than 2,000 mostly Catholic orphans to live in rural farming communities. The city of Opelousas is constructing an Orphan Train Museum (second in the nation) in an old train depot located in Le Vieux Village in Opelousas. The first museum dedicated to the Orphan Train children is located in Kansas.\\r\\nDuring some of the Great Depression, Louisiana was led by Governor Huey Long. He was elected to office on populist appeal. Though popular for his public works projects, which provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and for his programs in education and increased suffrage for poor whites, Long was criticized for his allegedly demogogic and autocratic style. He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana's state government. Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state. Long's rule ended abruptly with his assassination in the state capitol in 1935.\\r\\nMobilization for World War II created jobs in the state. Thousands of other workers, black and white alike, migrated to California for better jobs in its burgeoning defense industry. Most African Americans left the state in the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s through the 1960s. The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living opportunities in communities where they could vote.[43]\\r\\nAlthough Long removed the poll tax associated with voting, the all-white primaries were maintained through 1944, until the Supreme Court struck them down in Smith v. Allwright. Through 1948 black people in Louisiana continued to be essentially disfranchised, with only 1% of those eligible managing to vote.[44] Schools and public facilities continued to be segregated.\\r\\nState legislators created other ways to suppress black voting, but from 1948 to 1952, it crept up to 5% of those eligible. Civil rights organizations in New Orleans and southern parishes, where there had been a long tradition of free people of color before the Civil War, worked hard to register black voters.\\r\\nIn the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration. Despite opposition by the States' Rights Party, downstate black voters began to increase their rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes. Gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20% and more, but it was still only 32% by 1964, when the first civil rights legislation of the era was passed.[45] The percentage of black voters ranged widely in the state during these years, from 93.8% in Evangeline Parish to only 1.7% in Tensas Parish, for instance.[46]\\r\\nPatterns of Jim Crow segregation against African Americans still ruled in Louisiana in the 1960s. Because of the Great Migration of blacks to the north and west, and growth of other groups in the state, by 1960 the proportion of African Americans in Louisiana had dropped to 32%. The 1,039,207 black citizens were adversely affected by segregation and efforts at disfranchisement.[47] African Americans continued to suffer disproportionate discriminatory application of the state's voter registration rules. Because of better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, blacks continued to migrate from Louisiana, for a net loss of more than 37,000 people. During the latter period, some people began to migrate to cities of the New South for opportunities.[48]\\r\\nThe disfranchisement of African Americans did not end until their leadership and activism throughout the South during the Civil Rights Movement gained national attention and Congressional action. This led to securing passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, with President Lyndon Johnson's leadership as well. By 1968 almost 59% of eligible-age African Americans had registered to vote in Louisiana. Contemporary rates for African-American voter registration and turnout in the state are above 70%, demonstrating the value they give it, a higher rate of participation than for African-American voters outside the South.[46]\\r\\nIn August 2005, New Orleans and many other low-lying parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were hit by the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina. It caused widespread damage due to breaching of levees and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city. Officials issued warnings to evacuate the city and nearby areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, had stayed behind, some stranded, and suffered through the damage of the widespread flood waters.\\r\\nCut off in many cases from healthy food, medicine or water, or assembled in public spaces without functioning emergency services, more than 1500 people in New Orleans died in the aftermath. Government at all levels had failed to prepare adequately despite severe hurricane warnings, and emergency responses were slow. The state faced a humanitarian crisis stemming from conditions in many locations and the large tide of evacuating citizens, especially the city of New Orleans. Today, Louisiana is developing in several new industries including film and technology. New Orleans has recently gained the title of the fastest growing city in the United States and the Hollywood of the South. Louisiana has also been declared one of the happiest state's due to the many festivals and customs of her citizens.","input":"Who were the first known inhabitants in louisiana?"},{"output":"Louis Pasteur","context":"Rabies vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rabies.[1] There are a number of vaccines available that are both safe and effective.[1] They can be used to prevent rabies before and for a period of time after exposure to the virus such as by a dog or bat bite.[1] The immunity that develops is long lasting after three doses.[1] Doses are usually given by injection into the skin or muscle.[1] After exposure vaccination is typically used along with rabies immunoglobulin.[1] It is recommended that those who are at high risk of exposure be vaccinated before potential exposure.[1] Vaccines are effective in humans and other animals.[1] Vaccinating dogs is very effective in preventing the spread of rabies to humans.[1]\\r\\nRabies vaccines may be safely used in all age groups.[1] About 35 to 45 percent of people develop a brief period of redness and pain at the injection site.[1] About 5 to 15 percent of people may have fever, headaches, or nausea.[1] After exposure to rabies there is no contraindication to its use.[1] Most vaccines do not contain thimerosal.[1] Vaccines made from nerve tissue are used in a few countries, mainly in Asia and Latin America, but are less effective and have greater side effects.[1] Their use is thus not recommended by the World Health Organization.[1]\\r\\nThe first rabies vaccine was introduced in 1885, which was followed by an improved version in 1908.[2] Millions of people globally have been vaccinated and it is estimated that this saves more than 250,000 people a year.[1] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[3] The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 44 and 78 USD for a course of treatment as of 2014.[4] In the United States a course of rabies vaccine is more than 750 USD.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Health Organization recommends vaccinating in those who are at high risk of the disease including children who live in areas where it is common.[1] Four doses are given over a one-month period.[1]\\r\\nImmunity following a course of doses is typically long lasting.[1] Additional doses are not typically needed except in those at very high risk.[1] Following administration of a booster dose, one study found 97% of immuno-competent individuals demonstrate protective levels of neutralizing antibodies at 10 years.[6]\\r\\nThe human diploid cell rabies vaccine (H.D.C.V.) was started in 1967. Human diploid cell rabies vaccines are inactivated vaccines made using the attenuated Pitman-Moore L503 strain of the virus.[7] Human diploid cell rabies vaccines have been given to more than 1.5 million people as of 2006.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition to these developments, newer and less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine, and purified Vero cell rabies vaccine are now available. The purified Vero cell rabies vaccine uses the attenuated Wistar strain of the rabies virus, and uses the Vero cell line as its host.\\r\\nVirtually all infections with rabies resulted in death until two French scientists, Louis Pasteur and mile Roux, developed the first rabies vaccination in 1885. This vaccine was first used on a human on July 6, 1885, on nine-year-old Joseph Meister (1876ÿ1940), who had been mauled by a rabid dog.[8]\\r\\nTheir vaccine consisted of a sample of the virus harvested from infected (and necessarily dead) rabbits that was weakened by allowing it to dry for 5 to 10 days. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used now in some countries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines, they are not as effective.[9] Neural tissue vaccines also carry a certain risk of neurological complications.[10]\\r\\nPre-exposure immunization has been used on domesticated and wild populations. In many jurisdictions, domestic dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits are required to be vaccinated.\\r\\nAside from vaccinating humans, another approach was also developed by vaccinating dogs to prevent the spread of the virus. In 1979 the Van Houweling Research Laboratory of the Silliman University Medical Center in Dumaguete in the Philippines,[11] developed and produced a dog vaccine that gave a three-year immunity from rabies. The development of the vaccine resulted in the elimination of rabies in many parts of the Visayas and Mindanao Islands. The successful program in the Philippines was later used as a model by other countries, such as Ecuador and the Yucatan State of Mexico, in their fight against rabies conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization.[12]\\r\\nIn Tunisia a rabies control program was initiated to give dog owners free vaccination to promote mass vaccination which was sponsored by their government. The vaccine is known as Rabisin (Mrial), which is a cell based rabies vaccine only used countrywide. Vaccinations are often administered when owners take in their dogs for check-ups and visits at the vet.[13]\\r\\nThere is also vaccination in pellet form which can be left out for wild animals to produce a herd immunity effect.[14] Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) is a preventive measure to eradicate rabies in wild animal vectors of disease, mainly foxes, raccoons, raccoon dogs, coyotes and jackals, but also can be used for dogs in developing countries.[15] Baits are distributed by airplanes in rural areas and by hand in urban and suburban areas. The idea of wildlife vaccination was conceived during the 1960s, and modified-live rabies viruses were used for the experimental oral vaccination of carnivores by the 1970s. The development of safe and effective rabies virus vaccines applied in attractive baits resulted in the first field trials in Switzerland in 1978 to immunize red foxes.[16] ORV programs have seen success in preventing the westward spread of raccoon variant rabies in the United States and even eradicating rabies in red foxes in Switzerland.[17][18]\\r\\nImrab is an example of a veterinary rabies vaccine containing the Pasteur strain of killed rabies virus. Several different types of Imrab exist, including Imrab, Imrab 3, and Imrab Large Animal. Imrab 3 has been approved for ferrets and, in some areas, pet skunks.[19][20]","input":"Who was responsible for discovering the rabies vaccine?"},{"output":"21 April 1526","context":"The First Battle of Panipat, on 21 April 1526, was fought between the invading forces of Babur and the Lodi Empire. It took place in north India and marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire. This was one of the earliest battles involving gunpowder firearms and field artillery in India.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur gave attention to conquer India as he reached the banks of the Chenab in 1519.[4] Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfil his ancestor Timur's legacy, since it used to be part of his empire.[5] At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim.[6] He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne of the country, however the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.[7]\\r\\nBabur started for Lahore, Punjab, in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi.[8] When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and his army was routed.[8] In response, Babur burned Lahore for two days, then marched to Dipalpur, placing Alam Khan, another rebel uncle of Lodi's, as governor.[8] Alam Khan was quickly overthrown and fled to Kabul. In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi.[9] He defeated them and drove off Alam's army and Babur realised Lodhi would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.[9]\\r\\nHearing of the size of Ibrahim's army, Babur secured his right flank against the city of Panipat, while digging a trench covered with tree branches to secure his left flank. In the center, he placed 700 carts tied together with ropes. Between every two carts there were breastworks for his matchlockmen. Babur also ensured there was enough space for his cavalry to charge between these carts.[3]\\r\\nWhen Ibrahim's army arrived, he found the approach to Babur's army too narrow to attack. While Ibrahim redeployed his forces to allow for the narrower front, Babur quickly took advantage of the situation to flank (tulghuma) the Lodi army.[3] Many of Ibrahim's troops were unable to get into action, and fled when the battle turned against Ibrahim.[10] Faced with musket fire, cannon fire and cavalry attacks from all sides, Ibrahim Lodi fought and died with 6,000 of his remaining troops.[3]\\r\\nBabur's guns proved decisive in battle, firstly because Ibrahim Lodi lacked any field artillery, but also because the sound of the cannon frightened Lodi's elephants, causing them to trample Lodi's own men.[10]\\r\\nNew tactics introduced by Babur were the tulghuma and the araba. Tulghuma meant dividing the whole army into various units, viz. the Left, the Right and the Centre. The Left and Right divisions were further subdivided into Forward and Rear divisions. Through this a small army could be used to surround the enemy from all sides. The Centre Forward division was then provided with carts (araba) which were placed in rows facing the enemy and tied to each other with animal hide ropes. Behind them were placed cannons protected and supported by mantlets which could be used to easily maneuver the cannons. These two tactics made Babur's artillery lethal. The cannons could be fired without any fear of being hit, as they were shielded by the bullock carts held in place by hide ropes. The heavy cannons could also be easily traversed onto new targets, as they could be maneuvered by the mantlets which were on wheels.\\r\\nIbrahim Lodi died on the field of battle along with 15,000 of his troops. Vikramajit, ruler of Gwaliyar, was killed as well. The battle of Panipat was militarily a decisive victory. Politically it gained Babur little, and initiated a new phase of his establishment of the Mughal empire.[3]","input":"When was the first battle of panipath fought?"},{"output":"United States","context":"See text\\r\\nBlueberries are perennial flowering plants with indigo-colored berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium. Vaccinium also includes cranberries, bilberries and grouseberries.[1] Commercial \\"blueberries\\" are native to North America, and the \\"highbush\\" varieties were not introduced into Europe until the 1930s.[2]\\r\\nBlueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (3.9?in) to 4 meters (13?ft) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the smaller species are known as \\"lowbush blueberries\\" (synonymous with \\"wild\\"), while the larger species are known as \\"highbush blueberries\\".\\r\\nThe leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen, ovate to lanceolate, and 1ÿ8?cm (0.39ÿ3.15?in) long and 0.5ÿ3.5?cm (0.20ÿ1.38?in) broad. The flowers are bell-shaped, white, pale pink or red, sometimes tinged greenish. The fruit is a berry 5ÿ16 millimeters (0.20ÿ0.63?in) in diameter with a flared crown at the end; they are pale greenish at first, then reddish-purple, and finally dark purple when ripe. They are covered in a protective coating of powdery epicuticular wax, colloquially known as the \\"bloom\\".[3] They have a sweet taste when mature, with variable acidity. Blueberry bushes typically bear fruit in the middle of the growing season: fruiting times are affected by local conditions such as altitude and latitude, so the peak of the crop, in the northern hemisphere, can vary from May to August.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genus Vaccinium has a mostly circumpolar distribution, with species mainly being present in North America, Europe, and Asia.\\r\\nMany commercially sold species with English common names including \\"blueberry\\" are from North America. Many North American native species of blueberries are grown commercially in the Southern Hemisphere in Australia, New Zealand and South American nations.\\r\\nSeveral other wild shrubs of the genus Vaccinium also produce commonly eaten blue berries, such as the predominantly European Vaccinium myrtillus and other bilberries, which in many languages have a name that translates to \\"blueberry\\" in English. See the Identification section for more information.\\r\\nNote: habitat and range summaries are from the Flora of New Brunswick, published in 1986 by Harold R. Hinds and Plants of the Pacific Northwest coast, published in 1994 by Pojar and MacKinnon.\\r\\nSome other blue-fruited species of Vaccinium:\\r\\nCommercially offered blueberries are usually from species that naturally occur only in eastern and north-central North America. Other sections in the genus, native to other parts of the world, including the Pacific Northwest and southern United States,[4] South America, Europe, and Asia, include other wild shrubs producing similar-looking edible berries, such as huckleberries and whortleberries (North America) and bilberries (Europe). These species are sometimes called \\"blueberries\\" and sold as blueberry jam or other products.\\r\\nThe names of blueberries in languages other than English often translate as \\"blueberry\\", e.g., Scots blaeberry and Norwegian bl?b?r. Blaeberry, bl?b?r and French myrtilles usually refer to the European native bilberry (V. myrtillus), while bleuets refers to the North American blueberry. Russian ̾ҿ (\\"blue berry\\") does not refer to blueberries, which are non-native and nearly unknown in Russia, but rather to their close relatives, bog bilberries (V. uliginosum).\\r\\nCyanococcus blueberries can be distinguished from the nearly identical-looking bilberries by their flesh color when cut in half. Ripe blueberries have light green flesh, while bilberries, whortleberries and huckleberries are red or purple throughout.\\r\\nBlueberries may be cultivated, or they may be picked from semiwild or wild bushes. In North America, the most common cultivated species is V. corymbosum, the northern highbush blueberry. Hybrids of this with other Vaccinium species adapted to southern U.S. climates are known collectively as southern highbush blueberries.[5]\\r\\nSo-called \\"wild\\" (lowbush) blueberries, smaller than cultivated highbush ones, have intense color. The lowbush blueberry, V. angustifolium, is found from the Atlantic provinces westward to Quebec and southward to Michigan and West Virginia. In some areas, it produces natural \\"blueberry barrens\\", where it is the dominant species covering large areas. Several First Nations communities in Ontario are involved in harvesting wild blueberries.\\r\\n\\"Wild\\" has been adopted as a marketing term for harvests of managed native stands of lowbush blueberries. The bushes are not planted or genetically manipulated, but they are pruned or burned over every two years, and pests are \\"managed\\".[6]\\r\\nNumerous highbush cultivars of blueberries are available, with diversity among them, each having individual qualities. A blueberry breeding program has been established by the USDA-ARS breeding program at Beltsville, Maryland, and Chatsworth, New Jersey. This program began when Frederick Vernon Coville of the USDA-ARS collaborated with Elizabeth Coleman White of New Jersey.[7] In the early part of the 20th century, White offered pineland residents cash for wild blueberry plants with unusually large fruit.[8] After 1910 Coville began to work on blueberry, and was the first to discover the importance of soil acidity (blueberries need highly acidic soil), that blueberries do not self-pollinate, and the effects of cold on blueberries and other plant.[9] In 1911, he began a program of research in conjunction with White, daughter of the owner of the extensive cranberry bogs at Whitesbog in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. His work doubled the size of some strains' fruit, and by 1916, he had succeeded in cultivating blueberries, making them a valuable crop in the Northeastern United States.[10][11] For this work he received the George Roberts White Medal of Honor from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.\\r\\nThe rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum syn. V. ashei) is a southern type of blueberry produced from the Carolinas to the Gulf Coast states. Other important species in North America include V. pallidum, the hillside or dryland blueberry. It is native to the eastern U.S., and common in the Appalachians and the Piedmont of the Southeast. Sparkleberry, V. arboreum, is a common wild species on sandy soils in the Southeast.\\r\\nSuccessful blueberry cultivation requires attention to soil pH (acidity) measurements in the acidic range.[12][13][14]\\r\\nBlueberry bushes often require supplemental fertilization,[13] but over-fertilzation with nitrogen can damage plant health shown by nitrogen-burn visible on the leaves.[12][13]\\r\\nSignificant production of highbush blueberries occurs in British Columbia, Maryland, Western Oregon, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington. The production of southern highbush varieties in California is rapidly increasing, as varieties originating from University of Florida, Connecticut, New Hampshire, North Carolina State University and Maine have been introduced. Southern highbush berries are now also cultivated in the Mediterranean regions of Europe, Southern Hemisphere countries and China.\\r\\nAccording to a 2014 report by US Department of Agriculture, Washington was the nation's largest producer of cultivated (highbush) blueberries with 96.1 million pounds, followed in order of \\"utilized production\\" volume by Michigan and Georgia, Oregon, New Jersey, California and North Carolina.[15] In terms of acres harvested for cultivated blueberries in 2014, the leading state was Michigan (19,000 acres) followed by Georgia, Oregon, Washington and New Jersey.[15]\\r\\nHammonton, New Jersey claims to be the \\"Blueberry Capital of the World,[16] with over 80% of New Jersey's cultivated blueberries coming from this town.[17] Every year the town hosts a large festival that draws thousands of people to celebrate the fruit.[18]\\r\\nResulting from cultivation of both lowbush (wild) and highbush blueberries, Maine accounts for 10% of all blueberries grown in North America with 44,000 hectares (110,000 acres) farmed, but only half of this acreage is harvested each year due to variations in pruning practices.[19] The wild blueberry is the official fruit of Maine.[20]\\r\\nCanadian production of wild and cultivated blueberries in 2015 was 166,000 tonnes valued at $262 million, the largest fruit crop produced nationally accounting for 29% of all fruit value.[21]\\r\\nBritish Columbia was the largest Canadian producer of cultivated blueberries, yielding 70,000 tonnes in 2015,[21] the world's largest production of blueberries by region.[22]\\r\\nAtlantic Canada contributes approximately half of the total North American wild/lowbush annual production with New Brunswick having the largest in 2015, an amount expanding in 2016.[23] Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Qubec are also major producers.[24] Nova Scotia recognizes the wild blueberry as its official provincial berry,[25] with the town of Oxford, Nova Scotia known as the Wild Blueberry Capital of Canada.[26]\\r\\nQubec is a major producer of wild blueberries, especially in the regions of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (where a popular name for inhabitants of the regions is bleuets, or \\"blueberries\\") and C?te-Nord, which together provide 40% of Qubec's total provincial production. This wild blueberry commerce benefits from vertical integration of growing, processing, frozen storage, marketing and transportation within relatively small regions of the province.[27] On average, 80% of Qubec wild blueberries are harvested on farms (21 million kg), the remaining 20% being harvested from public forests (5 million kg).[27] Some 95% of the wild blueberry crop in Qubec is frozen for export out of the province.[27]\\r\\nHighbush blueberries were first introduced to Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands in the 1930s, and have since been spread to Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Poland, Italy, Hungary and other countries of Europe.[2] Poland, Germany, and France were the largest European producers in 2014 (table).\\r\\nThe northeastern part of Turkey is one of the main sources of Caucasian whortleberry (V. arctostaphylos), bilberry (V. myrtillus) and bog blueberry, bog whortleberry or bog bilberry (V. uliginosum). This region from Artvin to K?rklareli, as well as parts of Bursa (including Rize, Trabzon, Ordu, Giresun, Samsun, Sinop, Kastamonu, Zonguldak, ?stanbul, ?zmit and Adapazari) have rainy, humid growing periods and naturally acidic soils suitable for blueberries (?elik, 2005, 2006 and 2007).[full citation needed]\\r\\nNative Vaccinium species and open-pollinated types have been grown for over a hundred years around the Black Sea region of Turkey. These native blueberries are eaten locally as jelly or dried or fresh fruit (?elik, 2005).[full citation needed] Highbush blueberry cultivation started around the year 2000. The first commercial blueberry orchard was established by Osman Nuri Yildiz and supervised by Dr. Huseyin Celik, the founder of Turkish blueberry cultivation.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia now export blueberries.\\r\\nBlueberries were first introduced to Australia in the 1950s, but the effort was unsuccessful. In the early 1970s, David Jones from the Victorian Department of Agriculture imported seed from the U.S. and a selection trial was started. This work was continued by Ridley Bell, who imported more American varieties. In the mid-1970s, the Australian Blueberry Growers' Association was formed.[28]\\r\\nThe industry is new to Argentina: \\"Argentine blueberry production has increased over the last three years with planted area up to 400 percent\\", according to a 2005 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.[29] \\"Argentine blueberry production has thrived in four different regions: the province of Entre Rios in northeastern Argentina, the province of Tucuman, the province of Buenos Aires and the southern Patagonian valleys\\", according to the report.[30] In the Bureau of International Labor Affairs report of 2014 on child labor and forced labor, blueberries were listed among the goods produced in such working conditions in Argentina.[31]\\r\\nChile is the biggest producer in South America and the largest exporter to the Northern Hemisphere, with an estimated area of 14,500 hectares (36,000 acres) in 2014.[citation needed] Chile exported about 104,505 tons of blueberry in the 2014/2015 season.[citation needed]\\r\\nIntroduction of the first plants into Chile occurred in 1979, brought from US and New Zealand, and commercial production started in the 1990s in the southern part of the country.[citation needed] Today, production ranges from Copiap܇ in the north to Puerto Montt in the south, allowing the country to offer blueberries from October through late March. Production has evolved rapidly in the last decade, becoming the fourth most important fruit exported in value terms. Blueberries are exported mainly to North America (79%), followed by Europe (17%), and Asia (South Korea, China and Japan).\\r\\nIn Peru, there are several private initiatives for the development of the crop. Also, the government through its agency Sierra Exportadora, has launched the program \\"Peru Berries\\" to take advantage of the existence of the ideal soil and climate required by the blueberry.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2014, world production of blueberries (low- and highbush combined) was 525,620 tonnes, led by the United States with 50% of total production and Canada with 35%.[32]\\r\\nThe blueberry harvest in North America varies. It can start as early as May and usually ends in late summer. The principal areas of production in the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, Chile, New Zealand and Argentina) have long periods of harvest. In Australia, for example, due to the geographic spread of blueberry farms and the development of new cultivation techniques, the industry is able to provide fresh blueberries for 10 months of the year ÿ from July through to April.[28] Similar to other fruits and vegetables, climate-controlled storage allows growers to preserve picked blueberries. Harvest in the UK is from June to August. Mexico also can harvest from October to February.\\r\\nAlthough blueberries were traditionally hand-picked with berry-picking rakes, modern farmers use machine harvesters that shake the fruit off the bush of cultivated highbush blueberries, while new machines are being developed for wild, lowbush blueberries.[33] The fruit is then brought to a cleaning and packaging facility where it is cleaned, packaged, and then sold. In Mexico, each farmer packs on site and sells directly, or may transport to a warehouse for storage until the berries are sold.[citation needed] Tunnels are often used to grow blueberries in Europe and this makes the season longer. This creates an opportunity to move crops into earlier or later markets to get better prices.\\r\\nBlueberries are sold fresh or are processed as individually quick frozen (IQF) fruit, pure, juice, or dried or infused berries. These may then be used in a variety of consumer goods, such as jellies, jams, blueberry pies, muffins, snack foods, or as an additive to breakfast cereals.\\r\\nBlueberry jam is made from blueberries, sugar, water, and fruit pectin. Blueberry sauce is a sweet sauce prepared using blueberries as a primary ingredient.\\r\\nBlueberry wine is made from the flesh and skin of the berry, which is fermented and then matured; usually the lowbush variety is used.\\r\\nBlueberries consist of 14% carbohydrates, 0.7% protein, 0.3% fat and 84% water (table). They contain only negligible amounts of micronutrients, with moderate levels (relative to respective Daily Values) (DV) of the essential dietary mineral manganese, vitamin C, vitamin K and dietary fiber (table).[34] Generally, nutrient contents of blueberries are a low percentage of the DV (table). One serving provides a relatively low caloric value of 57 kcal per 100 g serving and glycemic load score of 6 out of 100 per day.[34]\\r\\nBlueberries contain anthocyanins, other polyphenols and various phytochemicals under preliminary research for their potential role in the human body. Most polyphenol studies have been conducted using the highbush cultivar of blueberries (V. corymbosum), while content of polyphenols and anthocyanins in lowbush (wild) blueberries (V. angustifolium) exceeds values found in highbush cultivars.[35]\\r\\nThe application of pesticides is common in large-scale blueberry monoculture in Maine.[36] Because \\"wild\\" is a marketing term generally used for all low-bush blueberries, it is not an indication that such blueberries are free from pesticides.\\r\\nThe Environmental Working Group, referencing the USDA,[37] rates blueberries as a \\"significant concern\\".[38][39]","input":"What country is the largest producer of blueberries?"},{"output":"Ferdinand and Isabel","context":"The Hostal dos Reis Cat܇licos (in Galician), also called the Hostal de Los Reyes Cat܇licos (in Spanish) or Parador de Santiago, is a 5-star Parador hotel, located in the Praza do Obradoiro, Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain.

In the late 15th century Ferdinand and Isabel themselves completed the pilgrimage across northern Spain.[2] As a sign of their religious piety, and their growing economic and political might, they began a program to improve the infrastructure and support services on the pilgrimage trail in Spain. They built new hostels, bridges, churches, and public wells.[3]\\r\\nThe most improvement project by Isabel and Ferdinand was the Hostal, right next to the great cathedral at the very end of the pilgrimage trail. The Hostal de los Reyes Cat܇licos served as a hospice and a hospital, where pilgrims could recover and rejuvenate after completing the pilgrimage.[4] The Hostal had a multilingual staff of doctors, nurses, and priests on call 24 hours a day; and provided all services free of charge. Pilgrims were allowed to recover at the Hostal for 3 days in the summer, and 5 days in the winter.[5]\\r\\nAs of 2014[update] the hotel continued to provide free services to a limited number of pilgrims.\\r\\nThe words hotel, hostel and hospital share the same root, based on the Latin hospes meaning guest.[6] Nowadays, the concepts are clearly differentiated, but at the time this building started operation the idea of a hostel included sleep, food, as well as care for wounded feet and other ailments deriving from long distance walking. There was little distinction between lodging and medical care as hostels were guided by the general concept of hospitality.\\r\\nConstruction of the building took over 10 years. Masons, engineers, and sculptors from all over Europe were called upon to work on the project.[7] The project was overseen by the architect Enrique Egas, and has a Plateresque facade.[8] In 1526, King Carlos V completed work on the Plaza Obradoiro, creating a large open plaza joining the Hostal and great Cathedral.[9]\\r\\nThe hotel was constructed with four colonnaded and interconnected courtyards within its walls. Two of these piazzas date from the eighteen hundreds, but the two earlier squares are from the sixteenth century and feature water fountains at their hearts. The later courtyards are of a baroque design and were constructed during an extensive re-modelling and renovation.\\r\\nSince the Hostal was essentially a large state-run hospital, it attracted many doctors and scholars. The Hostal began serving the medical needs of the city of Santiago de Compostela.[10] One of the oldest medical schools in Spain sprang up nearby, and it helped establish the tradition of the city as center for university learning and higher education.[11]\\r\\nDuring the 20th century, the dictator Francisco Franco stayed at the Hostal. It was Franco's decision, in 1954, to include it in the Spanish Parador hotel system, and to renovate the Hostal into a world class modern hotel.[12]\\r\\nToday, the Hostal dos Reis Cat܇licos is widely considered one of the finest hotels in the world.

Aroff of Beverly Hills was the general contractor.[4] The Flamingo Capri opened in 1959.[5] The original Flamingo agreed to provide hotel services to guests at the Capri.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph Engelstad purchased the motel in 1971, and added a casino in 1972.[3] Prior to the addition of a casino, the motel had 250 employees.[6] In 1973, four motel buildings from the Flamingo Capri were relocated and converted to become part of Engelstad's other property, the Kona Kai motel.[7] Engelstad's construction company added a three-story wing at the east end of the motel, as well as a northern addition,[3] both of which opened in 1974 along with the Shangri-la pool.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1976, the motel was being operated as part of the Best Western hotel chain, while retaining the Flamingo Capri name. The new Imperial Palace Tower, which raised the number of rooms from 300 to 650, was completed in July 1977.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property re-opened as the Asian-themed Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino on November 1, 1979,[3] with the number of employees increasing to 1,000.[6] Merlin J. Barth was the architect of the resort,[9] which was themed after an Asian palace.[10] Engelstad chose the Oriental theme, and Barth chose blue tile imported from Japan for the roof of the resort, having been influenced by Japanese temples. The interior heavily featured the Oriental theme as well, and included carved dragons and giant wind chime chandeliers.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of opening, the resort included Court of a Thousand Treasures, a four-story shopping arcade with 60 stores, overlooking the east end of the 30,000?sq?ft (2,800?m2) casino.[11][12][13] The Imperial Theatre showroom with 850 seats was opened in June 1980.[3] In addition to live shows, the showroom was also expanded to be used for filming of sports and entertainment television specials.[6] A second hotel tower with 850 rooms was added in early 1981.[citation needed] The Auto Collections opened on December 1, 1981,[3] on the fifth floor of a new parking garage which was added that year.[citation needed] A 650-room hotel tower opened in August 1982, bringing the total room count to more than 1,500.[6][13] By 1982, the shopping arcade included the free Imperial Palace School of Gaming, for gamblers who did not know how to play.[14][15][16] The school operated as a mini casino overlooking the main 40,000?sq?ft (3,700?m2) casino.[17] During the 1980s, the resort served as the starting and finishing location of the annual Imperial Palace Antique Auto Run.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, a couple from Missouri were assaulted in their guest room by a man dressed as a hotel employee. They were beaten, bound and gagged, and the wife was raped. The assailant was never caught. The couple sued the Imperial Palace, claiming that the hotel did not provide adequate security. The lawsuit lasted until at least 1989, with allegations that hotel employees destroyed evidence relating to their security practices. The case was ultimately settled on undisclosed terms.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawsuit would lead indirectly to more trouble for the casino. In 1988, several employees, angry about being placed on leave as punishment for talking to the plaintiff attorney, began speaking to the Gaming Control Board and local media about two Nazi-themed parties Engelstad had held at the Imperial Palace. The parties were held in Engelstad's so-called \\"war room\\", which featured a large collection of World War II Nazi memorabilia, including a portrait of Engelstad in the likeness of Hitler. A national controversy ensued. Engelstad claimed the collection was purely of historical interest, and not meant to glorify the Nazis. The Gaming Control Board recommended that Engelstad lose his gaming license and be fined $200,000 for reflecting poorly on the reputation of the Nevada gaming industry. An agreement was ultimately reached whereby Engelstad kept his license, but paid $1.5 million in penalties.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, the parking garage was expanded to include more than 1,000 additional parking spaces,[3] becoming one of the largest parking facilities in Las Vegas.[21] In December 1985, the foundation was laid for a 560-room hotel addition,[22] which was completed in 1986 as the resort's fourth tower, bringing the room count total to 2,100.[3] The Imperial Palace became the seventh largest hotel in the world, and had more than 2,200 employees. Also in 1986, the casino was expanded by 15,000 square feet (1,400?m2), and convention facilities were increased from 25,000?sq?ft (2,300?m2) to 30,000?sq?ft (2,800?m2).[21] A fifth and final hotel tower, standing 19 stories with 547 rooms, was completed in July 1987, bringing the total to 2,637 rooms.[3][23] The tower was the former location of the resort's pool.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, the Governor's Committee for the Handicapped named the Imperial Palace as \\"Employer of the Year\\" for its extensiving hiring of handicapped people.[24] A three-phase expansion began in August 1987 and concluded in July 1989.[21][25] The three-phase expansion included the addition of a new Olympic-size swimming pool, a heated spa, and a poolside bar.[6] The final phase of the expansion ÿ including a race & sportsbook, and fitness center ÿ extended the resort to the sidewalk along Las Vegas Boulevard. The sportsbook was completed in September 1989,[6] and a drive-through option was created in 1991, making the Imperial Palace the first casino in Las Vegas to offer such a feature. The drive-through sportsbook, located on Koval Lane behind the hotel, became popular among customers.[26] In 1991, the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities named the Imperial Palace \\"National Employer of the Year\\" for its hiring of disabled people.[25] In 1993, an independent 24-hour medical facility serving guests and employees was opened.[citation needed] In the 1990s, the Imperial Palace's gaming school operated on the main casino floor.[27][28] In 1997, Engelstad opened a second Imperial Palace in Biloxi, Mississippi.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 1997, the Imperial Palace was the 10th largest hotel in the world and the world's largest privately owned hotel.[6] When Engelstad died in 2002, the casino ownership transferred to the Ralph Engelstad and Betty Engelstad Trust. The casino operated as its own limited partnership, Imperial Palace LLC, under the Trust's oversight. At the time of Engelstad's death, the resort was the second-largest privately owned hotel in the world, with nearly 2,700 rooms and 2,600 employees.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 22, 2005, Harrah's Entertainment announced plans to purchase the property. The acquisition was completed on December 23, 2005. During a conference call with investors on November 20, 2005, the Chairman for Harrah's, Gary Loveman, noted that both the Imperial Palace and neighboring O'Sheas Casino \\"are going to require very substantial modifications or complete tear-downs and rebuilds\\" in order to make room for an expansion of the nearby Harrah's and/or Flamingo hotel-casinos.[29] However, since then, Harrah's has invested millions of dollars into refurbishing both the hotel rooms and the casino itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2009, Harrah's announced new plans for the area around the Imperial Palace, O'Sheas, and Flamingo casinos, confirming that the Imperial Palace will not be demolished at this time. Harrah's planned to add approximately 20 restaurants and bars between O'Sheas and the Flamingo.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2011, Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced it will be building a massive entertainment complex adjacent to the Imperial Palace and on the site of O'Sheas casino, called Project LINQ. The Imperial Palace name will be retired and the property renamed.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 17, 2012, Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced that Imperial Palace would be renamed The Quad Resort and Casino. The official conversion was completed on December 21, 2012.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2014, Caesars announced that the Quad would be again renamed The Linq Hotel & Casino[34] in order to join the LINQ Promenade, an adjacent shopping and entertainment center that opened in January 2014,  following a $223 million renovation of the property.[35] The hotel and casino were officially renamed on October 30, 2014.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Linq Promenade is an open-air retail, dining, and entertainment district located between The Linq and Flamingo resorts that began a soft open in January 2014. \\r\\n\\r\\nCaesars Entertainment Corporation announced the intended addition of Fly LINQ, expected to be the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip. Construction began in the spring of 2018 and opens in late 2018.[38]Once complete, the Fly LINQ attraction will feature 10 side-by-side zip lines. [39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 31, 2014, Caesars Entertainment opened the 550-foot-tall High Roller, The World's Tallest Observation Wheel at The LINQ Promenade.\\r\\n\\r\\nO'Sheas Casino reopened in December 2013, attached to the Linq's casino floor and to its shopping promenade.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Auto Collections was a collection of classic vehicles on display at the resort until 2017.[42] The museum opened on December 1, 1981,[3][43] known then as the Antique and Classic Auto Collections.[13][44] The museum initially consisted of Engelstad's own private car collection,[42] worth over $10 million at the time of the opening.[43] The exhibition was located in an air-conditioned facility on the 5th floor of the resort's parking garage.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nDon Williams and Richie Clyne took over operations of the museum in 1999.[47] Under their management, the museum began offering its vehicles for sale and trade on February 1, 2000.[48] Approximately 200 vehicles were kept in storage nearby. Vehicles would be taken out of storage to take the place of those that had been sold in the exhibit. Approximately half of the vehicles in the collection were owned by Williams and Clyne.[49] The Auto Collections closed on December 30, 2017.[42][50] Rob Williams, the general manager and a part-owner, said about the closure, \\"It's time; it's basically that simple. We've had a great run here  It's just time to close it down and move on to our next endeavors.\\" Although visitor attendance had slightly declined, it was not a reason for the closure.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibit was located in 125,000?sq?ft (11,600?m2) of space. The collection was the world's largest classic car showroom, with more than $25 million worth of inventory on display and for sale. More than 250 antique, classic, muscle and historically significant cars were on display and nearly all were for sale. Prices varied dramatically depending on many factors and ranged from as low as $30,000 to several million dollars for the especially rare pieces in the collection. Some of the cars presented included those once driven by famous celebrities or utilized by state officials, such as the 1955 Lincoln Capri Convertible owned by Marilyn Monroe, the 1939 Chrysler Royal Sedan formerly belonging to Johnny Carson or the 1962 Lincoln Continental Towne Limousine serving President John F. Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMat Franco - Magic Reinvented Nightly stars Mat Franco, the season nine winner on NBC's America's Got Talent.

These impersonators, which included Joliet Jake from the Blues Brothers, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Cher, Shakira, Roy Orbison, Zac Brown, Shania Twain, Britney Spears, Buddy Holly, and others, alternated dealing cards and performing a song on a small stage in the center of the tables. The Dealertainers pit was discontinued as of September 8, 2014.[55]","input":"Who owns the imperial palace in las vegas?"},{"output":"Vespasian","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum or Coliseum (/k?l??si??m/ kol-?-SEE-?m), also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a?fite?a?tro ?fla?vjo] or Colosseo [kolos?s??o]), is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete,[1] it is the largest amphitheatre ever built. The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72,[2] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus.[3] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81ÿ96).[4] These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators,[5][6] having an average audience of some 65,000;[7][8] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit \\"Way of the Cross\\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium, often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre. The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty, following the reign of Nero.[10] This name is still used in modern English, but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic[11][12] as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby[4] (the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes).[citation needed] This statue was later remodeled by Nero's successors into the likeness of Helios (Sol) or Apollo, the sun god, by adding the appropriate solar crown. Nero's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors. Despite its pagan links, the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers. It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 8th century, a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted: Quamdiu stat Colis?us, stat et Roma; quando cadet colis?us, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus (\\"as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world\\").[14] This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage). However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colossus did eventually fall, possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze. By the year 1000 the name \\"Colosseum\\" had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre. The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives, situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages. In Italy, the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo, and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul (Romanian), le Colise (French), el Coliseo (Spanish) and o Coliseu (Portuguese).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.[15] \\r\\n Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre; in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \\"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\\" Along with the spoils, estimated 100,000 Jewish prisoners were brought back to Rome after the war, and many contributed to the massive workforce needed for construction. The slaves undertook manual labor such as working in the quarries at Tivoli where the travertine was quarried, along with lifting and transporting the quarried stones 20 miles from Tivoli to Rome.[16] Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian[4] in around 70ÿ72 AD (73-75 AD according to some sources)[16] The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80,[4] and the inaugural games were held in A.D. 80 or 81.[16] Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration.[17] The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the hypogeum, a series of underground tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius[19]) which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435. An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425ÿ455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484[20] and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes, criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use during the medieval period. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSevere damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. A religious order moved into the northern third of the Colosseum in the mid-14th century [21] and continued to inhabit it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble fa?ade) was burned to make quicklime.[15] The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V (1585ÿ1590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death.[22] In 1671 Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1749, Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred. He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross, declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there (see Significance in Christianity). However, there is no historical evidence to support Benedict's claim, nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the 16th century suggested this might be the case; the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition, other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The fa?ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810ÿ1814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum is today one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of 40?billion Italian lire ($19.3m / ?20.6m at 2000 prices).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment, which was abolished in Italy in 1948. Several antiÿdeath penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000. Since that time, as a gesture against the death penalty, the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum's night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released,[24] or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty. Most recently, the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November 2012 following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April 2012.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the ruined state of the interior, it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating. However, much larger concerts have been held just outside, using the Colosseum as a backdrop. Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles (May 2002),[26] Paul McCartney (May 2003),[27] Elton John (September 2005),[28] and Billy Joel (July 2006).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike earlier Greek theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two Roman theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615?ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510?ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of 24,000 square metres (6 acres). The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157?ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788?ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an oval 87?m (287?ft) long and 55?m (180?ft) wide, surrounded by a wall 5?m (15?ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic metres (3,531,467 cubic feet) of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.[15] However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surviving part of the outer wall's monumental fa?ade comprises three stories of superimposed arcades surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic, both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals. The arcades are framed by half-columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters.[29] Each of the arches in the second- and third-floor arcades framed statues, probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic. They originally supported a retractable awning, known as the velarium, that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the center.[4] It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby Castra Misenatium, were used to work the velarium.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum's huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly. Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadiums to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators.[4] Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIV (54) survive.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards, which directed them to the appropriate section and row. They accessed their seats via vomitoria (singular vomitorium), passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind. These quickly dispersed people into their seats and, upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation, could permit their exit within only a few minutes. The name vomitoria derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge, from which English derives the word vomit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Codex-Calendar of 354, the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000. They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or podium for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs. The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tier above the senators, known as the maenianum primum, was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights (equites). The next level up, the maenianum secundum, was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens (plebeians) and was divided into two sections. The lower part (the immum) was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the summum) was for poor citizens. Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on. Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them. Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother level, the maenianum secundum in legneis, was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian. This comprised a gallery for the common poor, slaves and women. It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches. Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach tier was divided into sections (maeniana) by curved passages and low walls (praecinctiones or baltei), and were subdivided into cunei, or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria. Each row (gradus) of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arena itself was 83?meters by 48?meters (272?ft by 157?ft / 280 by 163?Roman feet).[15] It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is harena or arena), covering an elaborate underground structure called the hypogeum (literally meaning \\"underground\\"). The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the hypogeum is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called hegmata, provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypogeum was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubstantial quantities of machinery also existed in the hypogeum. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms[15] and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct. However, the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian's behest put an end to the practise of flooding, and thus also to naval battles, early in the Colosseum's existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games. Immediately to the east is the remains of the Ludus Magnus, a training school for gladiators. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators. The Ludus Magnus had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators. Other training schools were in the same area, including the Ludus Matutinus (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso nearby were the Armamentarium, comprising an armory to store weapons; the Summum Choragium, where machinery was stored; the Sanitarium, which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the Spoliarium, where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of 18?m (59?ft) from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the velarium or awning.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nRight next to the Colosseum is also the Arch of Constantine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called munera, were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige, and were immensely popular with the population. Another popular type of show was the animal hunt, or venatio. This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. Such events were occasionally on a huge scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions ad bestias would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces.  Other performances would also take place by acrobats and magicians, typically during the intervals.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for naumachiae (more properly known as navalia proelia) or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong, or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSylvae or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena's floor, and animals would then be introduced. Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story ÿ played by a condemned person ÿ was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum today is now a major tourist attraction in Rome with thousands of tourists each year entering to view the interior arena.[32] There is now a museum dedicated to Eros located in the upper floor of the outer wall of the building. Part of the arena floor has been re-floored. Beneath the Colosseum, a network of subterranean passageways once used to transport wild animals and gladiators to the arena opened to the public in summer 2010.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum[34][35] on Good Fridays.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011 Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm  Tod's, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a ?25?million restoration of the Colosseum. Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years.[36] Due to the controversial nature of using a publicÿprivate partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013. The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum's history.[37] The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum's arcaded fa?ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches. Taking three years, the final product of this work was unveiled July 1, 2016, when the Italian minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018. These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for \\"cultural events of the highest level.\\"[38] The project also plans to create a services center and to restore the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum.[39]. New to tours of the restored marvel beginning November 1, 2017, the top two levels have been opened for guided visits. The fourth level held the marketplace, and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens, the plebians, gathered and watched the show, bringing picnics for the day-long event.

Martinelli's book evidently had an effect on public opinion; in response to Cardinal Altieri's proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring, Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration. The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum's external arcades and declare it a sanctuary.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the insistence of St. Leonard of Port Maurice, Pope Benedict XIV (1740ÿ1758) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena, which remained until February 1874.[59] Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum, living on alms, before he died in 1783.[59]  Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum, and it still retains its Christian connection today. A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum, with a plaque, stating:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amphitheater, one consecrated to triumphs, entertainments, and the impious worship of pagan gods, is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions.[49]\\r\\nOther Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colosseum has a wide and well-documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643. Since then, 684 species have been identified there. The peak was in 1855 (420 species). Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation, because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry, but much of it has returned.[15] 242 species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli, 200 remain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries. Additionally, bird migration, flower blooming, and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city, as well as deliberate transport of species, are also contributing causes. Another reason often given is their seeds being unwittingly transported either on the fur or in the feces of animals brought there from all corners of the empire.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 415324.61N 122932.17E? / ?41.8901694N 12.4922694E? / 41.8901694; 12.4922694","input":"Which emperor built the colosseum 70 ce in rome?"},{"output":"electromagnetic","context":"Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 gigahertz (GHz) to as low as 30 hertz (Hz).[1] At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm, and at 30 Hz is 10,000 km. Like all other electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at the speed of light.  They are generated by electric charges undergoing acceleration, such as time varying electric currents.[2]  Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects. \\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers, using antennas.   Radio waves are very widely used in modern technology for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and other navigation systems, communications satellites, wireless computer networks and many other applications. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves can diffract around obstacles like mountains and follow the contour of the earth (ground waves), shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and return to earth beyond the horizon (skywaves), while much shorter wavelengths bend or diffract very little and travel on a line of sight, so their propagation distances are limited to the visual horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent interference between different users, the artificial generation and use of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which defines radio waves as \\"electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily lower than 3?000?GHz, propagated in space without artificial guide\\".[3] The radio spectrum is divided into a number of radio bands on the basis of frequency, allocated to different uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves were first predicted by mathematical work done in 1867 by Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell.[4] Maxwell noticed wavelike properties of light and similarities in electrical and magnetic observations. His mathematical theory, now called Maxwell's equations, described light waves and radio waves as waves of electromagnetism that travel in space, radiated by a charged particle as it undergoes acceleration. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the reality of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating radio waves in his laboratory,[5] showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light:  standing waves, refraction, diffraction, and polarization.  Radio waves, originally called \\"Hertzian waves\\",[6] were first used for communication in the mid 1890s by Guglielmo Marconi, who developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers.  The modern term \\"radio wave\\" replaced the original name \\"Hertzian wave\\" around 1912.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light.[7][8] When passing through a material medium, they are slowed according to that object's permeability and permittivity.  Air is thin enough that in the Earth's atmosphere radio waves travel very close to the speed of light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wavelength is the distance from one peak of the wave's electric field (wave's peak/crest) to the next, and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave. The distance a radio wave travels in one second, in a vacuum, is 299,792,458 meters (983,571,056?ft) which is the wavelength of a 1 hertz radio signal. A 1 megahertz radio signal has a wavelength of 299.8 meters (984?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study of radio propagation, how radio waves move in free space and over the surface of the Earth, is vitally important in the design of practical radio systems.  Radio waves passing through different environments experience reflection, refraction, polarization, diffraction, and absorption.  Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, making certain radio bands more useful for specific purposes than others.  Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn radio communication systems, information is carried across space using radio waves.  At the sending end, the information to be sent, in the form of a time-varying electrical signal, is applied to a radio transmitter.[10]  The information signal can be an audio signal representing sound from a microphone, a video signal representing moving images from a video camera, or a digital signal representing data from a computer.  In the transmitter, an electronic oscillator generates an alternating current oscillating at a radio frequency, called the carrier because it serves to \\"carry\\" the information through the air.  The information signal is used to modulate the carrier, altering some aspect of it, \\"piggybacking\\" the information on the carrier.  The modulated carrier is amplified and applied to an antenna.  The oscillating current pushes the electrons in the antenna back and forth, creating oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves.  The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.[10]  This voltage is applied to the radio receiver, which extracts the information signal.  The receiver first uses a bandpass filter to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then amplifies the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a demodulator.  The recovered signal is sent to a loudspeaker or earphone to produce sound, or a television display screen to produce a visible image, or other devices.  A digital data signal is applied to a computer or microprocessor, which interacts with a human user.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other.  They can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words each transmitter has a different frequency, measured in kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).  The bandpass filter in the receiver consists of a tuned circuit which acts like a resonator, similarly to a tuning fork.[10]  It has a natural resonant frequency at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station.  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves are nonionizing radiation, which means they do not have enough energy to separate electrons from atoms or molecules, ionizing them, or break chemical bonds, causing chemical reactions or DNA damage.  The main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them, similarly to the infrared waves radiated by sources of heat such as a space heater or wood fire.  The oscillating electric field of the wave causes polar molecules to vibrate back and forth, increasing the temperature; this is how a microwave oven cooks food.  However, unlike infrared waves, which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating, radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues.   The depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency, and also depends on the material's resistivity and permittivity; it is given by a parameter called the skin depth of the material, which is the depth within which 63% of the energy is deposited.   For example, the 2.45?GHz radio waves (microwaves) in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately 2.5 to 3.8?cm (1 to 1.5 inches).   Radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of diathermy for deep heating of body tissue, to promote increased blood flow and healing.  More recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in hyperthermia treatment, to kill cancer cells.  Looking into a source of radio waves at close range, such as the waveguide of a working radio transmitter, can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating. A strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause cataracts.[11][12][13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the heating effect is in principle no different from other sources of heat, most research into possible health hazards of exposure to radio waves has focused on \\"nonthermal\\" effects; whether radio waves have any effect on tissues besides that caused by heating.      Electromagnetic radiation has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as \\"Possibly carcinogenic to humans\\".[16] The conceivable evidence of cancer risk via Personal exposure to RF-EMF with mobile telephone use was identified. [17]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio waves can be shielded against by a conductive metal sheet or screen, an enclosure of sheet or screen is called a Faraday cage.   A metal screen shields against radio waves as well as a solid sheet as long as the holes in the screen are smaller than about 1/20 of wavelength of the waves.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince radio frequency radiation has both an electric and a magnetic component, it is often convenient to express intensity of radiation field in terms of units specific to each component. The unit volts per meter (V/m) is used for the electric component, and the unit amperes per meter (A/m) is used for the magnetic component. One can speak of an electromagnetic field, and these units are used to provide information about the levels of electric and magnetic field strength at a measurement location.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother commonly used unit for characterizing an RF electromagnetic field is power density. Power density is most accurately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from the RF emitter to be located in what is referred to as the far field zone of the radiation pattern.[19] In closer proximity to the transmitter, i.e., in the \\"near field\\" zone, the physical relationships between the electric and magnetic components of the field can be complex, and it is best to use the field strength units discussed above. Power density is measured in terms of power per unit area, for example, milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2). When speaking of frequencies in the microwave range and higher, power density is usually used to express intensity since exposures that might occur would likely be in the far field zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nELF    3 Hz/100 Mm    30 Hz/10 Mm\\r\\n\\r\\nSLF   30 Hz/10 Mm    300 Hz/1 Mm\\r\\n\\r\\nULF  300 Hz/1 Mm       3 kHz/100 km\\r\\n\\r\\nVLF    3 kHz/100 km   30 kHz/10 km\\r\\n\\r\\nLF   30 kHz/10 km   300 kHz/1 km\\r\\n\\r\\nMF  300 kHz/1 km      3 MHz/100 m\\r\\n\\r\\nHF    3 MHz/100 m    30 MHz/10 m\\r\\n\\r\\nVHF   30 MHz/10 m    300 MHz/1 m\\r\\n\\r\\nUHF  300 MHz/1 m       3 GHz/100 mm\\r\\n\\r\\nSHF    3 GHz/100 mm   30 GHz/10 mm\\r\\n\\r\\nEHF   30 GHz/10 mm   300 GHz/1 mm\\r\\n\\r\\nTHF  300 GHz/1 mm      3 THz/0.1 mm","input":"Are radio waves electromagnetic waves or sound waves?"},{"output":"North Atlantic Ocean","context":"The East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean.

The degree granted at the conclusion of these four years of study is Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or, less commonly, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) depending on the medical school; both degrees allow the holder to practice medicine after completing an accredited residency program.[1][2]\\r\\nDuring the last year of graduate medical education, students apply for postgraduate residencies in their chosen field of specialization. These vary in competitiveness depending upon the desirability of the specialty, prestige of the program, and the number of applicants relative to the number of available positions. All but a few positions are granted via a national computer match which pairs an applicant's preference with the programs' preference for applicants.\\r\\nHistorically, post-graduate medical education began with a free-standing, one-year internship. Completion of this year continues to be the minimum training requirement for obtaining a general license to practice medicine in most states. However, because of the gradual lengthening of post-graduate medical education, and the decline of its use as the terminal stage in training, most new physicians complete the internship requirement as their first year of residency.\\r\\nNot withstanding the trend toward internships integrated into categorical residencies, the one-year \\"traditional rotating internship\\" (sometimes called a \\"transitional year\\") continues to exist. Some residency training programs, such as in neurology and ophthalmology, do not include an internship year and begin after completion of an internship or transitional year. Some use it to re-apply to programs into which they were not accepted, while others use it as a year to decide upon a specialty. In addition, osteopathic physicians \\"are required to have completed an American Osteopathic Association (AOA)-approved first year of training in order to be licensed in Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.\\"[3]\\r\\nEach of the specialties in medicine has established its own curriculum, which defines the length and content of residency training necessary to practice in that specialty. Programs range from 3 years after medical school for internal medicine and pediatrics, to 5 years for general surgery, to 7 years for neurosurgery. Each specialty training program either incorporates an internship year to satisfy the requirements of state licensure, or stipulates that an internship year be completed before starting the program at the second post-graduate year (PGY-2).\\r\\nA fellowship is a formal, full-time training program that focuses on a particular area within the specialty, with requirements beyond the related residency.[4] Many highly specialized fields require formal training beyond residency. Examples of these include cardiology, endocrinology, oncology after internal medicine; cardiothoracic anesthesiology after anesthesiology; cardiothoracic surgery, pediatric surgery, surgical oncology after general surgery; reproductive endocrinology/infertility, maternal-fetal medicine, gynecologic oncology after obstetrics/gynecology. There are many others for each field of study. In some specialties such as pathology and radiology, a majority of graduating residents go on to further their training. The training programs for these fields are known as fellowships and their participants are fellows, to denote that they already have completed a residency and are board eligible or board certified in their basic specialty. Fellowships range in length from one to three years and are granted by application to the individual program or sub-specialty organizing board. Fellowships often contain a research component.[5]\\r\\nThe physician or surgeon who has completed his or her residency and possibly fellowship training and is in the practice of his or her specialty is known as an attending physician. Physicians then must pass written and oral exams in their specialty in order to become board certified. Each of the 26 medical specialties has different requirements for practitioners to undertake continuing medical education activities.","input":"How many years is med school in us?"},{"output":"Super Bowl LII","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Football League (1933ÿpresent)\\r\\n\\r\\nMidnight green, silver, black, white[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeague championships (4)\\r\\n\\r\\nConference championships (4)\\r\\n\\r\\nDivision championships (13)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football franchise based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. They are Super Bowl champions, having won Super Bowl LII; their first Super Bowl in franchise history, and their fourth NFL title overall, after winning the Championship Game in 1948, 1949, and 1960.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets, when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Bell, Chuck Bednarik, Bob Brown, Brian Dawkins, Reggie White, Steve Van Buren, Tommy McDonald, Greasy Neale, Pete Pihos, Sonny Jurgensen, Terrell Owens, and Norm Van Brocklin have been inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team has an intense rivalry with the New York Giants. This rivalry is the oldest in the NFC East and is among the oldest in the NFL. It was ranked by NFL Network as the number one rivalry of all-time and Sports Illustrated ranks it amongst the Top 10 NFL rivalries of all-time at number four,[4] and according to ESPN, it is one of the fiercest and most well-known rivalries in the American football community.[5] They also have a bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, which has become more high-profile since the 1960s, as well as a historic rivalry with the Washington Redskins. Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers is another bitter rivalry, roughly dating back to 1933, that mostly arises from the two teams' statuses as being from opposite ends of the same state.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team consistently ranks among the best in the league in attendance and has sold out every game since the 1999 season.[7][8] In a Sports Illustrated poll of 321 NFL players, Eagles fans were selected the most intimidating fans in the NFL.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMidway through the 1931 season, the Frankford Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.[10] After more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray and awarded them the franchise rights of the failed Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell-Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500 (equal to $40,230 today) and assumed a total debt of $11,000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises.[11] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the National Recovery Administrationthe centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal[11]Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. Neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy. Furthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first roster. The Eagles, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the now-defunct Cincinnati Reds, joined the NFL as expansion teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the Eagles moved to Shibe Park (renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954) and played their home games at the stadium through 1957, except for the 1941 season, which was played at Municipal Stadium, where they had played from 1936 to 1939.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management set up stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20 feet high, these \\"east stands\\" had 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25 to 30,000.[12]\\r\\nThe Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, enduring repeated losing seasons. In December 1940, Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney sold his franchise to Alexis Thompson for $160,000 and then used half of the proceeds to buy a half interest in the Eagles from Bell, his longtime friend.[13] Soon after, Bell and Rooney traded the Eagles franchise to Thompson and moved it to Pittsburgh (as the \\"Steelers\\"), while Thompson moved the Steelers franchise to Philadelphia (as the \\"Eagles\\").[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1943, when manpower shortages stemming from World War II made it impossible to fill the roster, the team merged with the Pittsburgh Steelers forming the \\"Phil-Pitt Eagles\\" and were known as the \\"Steagles.\\" (The merger, never intended as a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the end of the 1943 season.) By the late 1940s, head coach Earle \\"Greasy\\" Neale and running back Steve Van Buren led the team to three consecutive NFL Championship Games, winning two of them in 1948 and 1949. Those two championships mark the Eagles as the only NFL team ever to win back-to-back championships by shutouts, defeating the Chicago Cardinals, 7ÿ0, in 1948in a blizzardand the Los Angeles Rams, 14ÿ0, in 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1957 season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles, whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.[14] The stadium switched from grass to AstroTurf in 1969. It was the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, the Eagles won their third NFL championship, under the leadership of future Pro Football Hall of Famers Norm Van Brocklin and Chuck Bednarik; the head coach was Buck Shaw. The 1960 Eagles, by a score of 17ÿ13, became the only team to defeat Vince Lombardi and his Green Bay Packers in the playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagles had a decent 1961 season and then fell on hard times in 1962. Jerry Wolman, after consulting his longtime friend Brandon Sturrock, bought the franchise in 1963 from the \\"Happy Hundred\\", a group of investors who owned the team from 1949 to 1963, for $5,505,000 (equal to $44,004,098 today).[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the Eagles from Wolman for $16,155,000[15] (equal to $107,807,505 today), then a record for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach Joe Kuharich after a disappointing 24ÿ41ÿ1 record during his five-year reign. He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great Pete Retzlaff as General Manager and Jerry Williams as coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the merger of the NFL and AFL in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East Division with their archrivals the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins, and the Dallas Cowboys. Their heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933 and is often named as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976, Dick Vermeil was hired from UCLA to coach the Eagles, who had only one winning season from 1962 to 1975.[18] Starting in 1978, head coach Dick Vermeil and quarterback Ron Jaworski led the team to four consecutive playoff appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nVermeil's 1980 team won their first NFC East title. They were matched up against their hated rival the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship game, which they won 20ÿ7. However, the Eagles lost to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV in 1981. The following year, the Eagles were eliminated in the wildcard round at home against the New York Giants. In the aftermath of the disappointing and strike-shortened season of 1982, head coach Dick Vermeil resigned, claiming that he was \\"burned out\\". Vermeil was replaced by defensive coordinator Marion Campbell.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1983, Tose announced that his daughter, Susan Fletcher, the Eagles' vice president and legal counsel, would eventually succeed him as primary owner of the Eagles. Then in 1984, rumors were circulating that Leonard Tose was thinking about moving the team to Phoenix, Arizona due to financial reasons.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65?million (equal to $147,899,134 today) to pay off his more than $25?million (equal to $56,884,282 today) in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhiladelphia football struggled through the Marion Campbell years of the mid-1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation. However, in the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to Memphis Showboats' elite pass rusher Reggie White. In 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base, but the Eagles failed to win a playoff game during Ryan's tenure. Possibly the worst of these losses was the so-called Fog Bowl in 1988 against the Chicago Bears, which happened to be Ryan's former team that he helped lead to a Super Bowl XX victory as defensive coordinator. Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, after an upset home playoff loss to the Redskins. Offensive coordinator Rich Kotite was promoted to head coach three days later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter All Pro defensive tackle Jerome Brown was killed in an automobile accident, the team and fanbase became dedicated to \\"bring it home for Jerome\\" in the 1992 season. Kotite did lead the Eagles to a playoff victory against the New Orleans Saints during the 1992 season, but they lost all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the offseason. Kotie's contract was not renewed after a disappointing 1994 season in which the Eagles went 7ÿ9, losing their last seven games after starting the season 7ÿ2. From 1988 to 1996, the Eagles qualified for the playoffs during six out of those nine seasons, but they won the NFC East only once, in 1988. Among the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback Randall Cunningham, tight end Keith Jackson, and running back Herschel Walker. But the \\"Gang Green\\" defense is possibly what defined the team, led by Reggie White, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons, Seth Joyner, Wes Hopkins, Mike Golic, Byron Evans, Eric Allen, Andre Waters and Mark McMillian.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994 from then-owner Norman Braman for an estimated $185?million. The club is now estimated to be the 17th most valuable sports team, worth $1.314?billion, as valuated in 2014 by Forbes.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Lurie's first season as owner, the team only had 7 wins, but that was followed by a 10-win season in 1995. Besides the 10 wins and a playoff berth, 1996 was an eventful year. The uniforms changed from the classic shade of Kelly Green to a darker midnight green, quarterback Randall Cunningham left after 11 seasons, and future fan favorite 13-year starter Brian Dawkins was drafted in the 2nd round. After slipping to 6ÿ9ÿ1, and then to 3ÿ13, head coach Ray Rhodes was fired after four seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, the Eagles hired head coach Andy Reid and drafted quarterback Donovan McNabb. From 1999 until 2004, the team continually improved, going from 5ÿ11 in 1999, returning to the playoffs in with an 11ÿ5 record in 2000, being eliminated in the divisional round. Moreover, the Eagles played in four straight NFC Championship Games between 2001 and 2004. In 2001, the Eagles stayed at 11ÿ5, beating the Buccaneers and Bears to advance to the NFC championship, where they lost to the St. Louis Rams. In 2002, the Eagles drafted running back Brian Westbrook, got the 1st round bye with the 2nd seed in the NFC with a 12ÿ4 record, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers got their revenge in the Championship and eliminated the Eagles. In 2003, they won the NFC's first seed, but Westbrook went down in Week 17, culminating in a loss to the Carolina Panthers in their 3rd straight NFC Championship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13ÿ1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the number one seed for the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didn't play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After defeating the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons, the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14ÿ14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Patriots won 24ÿ21.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team took a step back in 2005 with a 6ÿ10 record. McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, starting 4ÿ2 but losing three in a row, before McNabb finally succumbs to injury and is out for the rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil, but Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10ÿ6 record and a win in the wild card round, but they finished .500 in 2007. In 2008, the team won their 500th game, and they also drafted DeSean Jackson, a receiving threat when paired with McNabb.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 11, 2009, the team defeated the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 23ÿ11 en route to their sixth NFC Championship Game. In the NFC Championship, the Eagles made a rally, going from 24ÿ6 at halftime to 25ÿ24 with three minutes left in the fourth quarter, but they lost to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 32ÿ25 after quarterback Kurt Warner scored a last minute touchdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 13, 2009, the Eagles signed quarterback Michael Vick.[22] On December 6, 2009, Andy Reid became only the fifth coach in NFL history to win 100 or more games with a single team in a single decade (the other four are Tom Landry, Don Shula, Tony Dungy, and Bill Belichick, all Super Bowl winners).[23] McNabb finally had a complete receiving corps, between first round draft pick Jeremy Maclin, DeSean Jackson's 1,000 yard season, and Brent Celek ranking among the top 5 tight ends in the league. Without Brian Dawkins, defensive end Trent Cole stepped up and became the dominant force on defense with 12 sacks, earning him his second trip to the Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors. In 2009, the Eagles started 5ÿ4, and then won six straight games. After a shutout against the Dallas Cowboys in week 17, the Eagles missed the first-round bye, but with a record of 11ÿ5, they were the NFC's sixth seed. In their January 2010 wild card game, the Eagles played against their divisional foes for the second consecutive week, losing 34ÿ14 to hand Dallas their first of two playoff wins since December 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 5, 2010, Brian Westbrook was cut from the Eagles after eight seasons with the team. On April 4, 2010, the team traded long-time starting quarterback Donovan McNabb to the Washington Redskins in exchange for a second round draft pick.[24] Kevin Kolb was immediately named the starter, but after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Packers, Vick took over as the starter. Vick led the Eagles to its sixth NFC East division title in ten seasons. With a record of 10ÿ6 the Eagles clinched the third seed. In the wild card round, the Eagles lost 21ÿ16 to eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 season for the Eagles was a major disappointment, as they only managed to finish 8ÿ8 and miss the playoffs. In 2012, the Eagles started off winning three out of their four first games, but lost their next eight, and were eliminated from the playoff hunt. They only won one out of their last four games. After a loss to the New York Giants on December 30, 2012, longtime head coach Andy Reid was fired after fourteen seasons with the team.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 16, 2013, the Eagles brought in University of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly to succeed Reid as head coach after a 4ÿ12 season.[26] The Philadelphia Eagles named Michael Vick starting quarterback going into the 2013 season with much promise running Chip Kelly's fast-paced spread offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2013 season proved to be more successful for the Eagles. A hamstring injury took Michael Vick out after a 1ÿ3 start, but his backup Nick Foles led the team to a 10ÿ6 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw 19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by Peyton Manning. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game with seven against the Oakland Raiders which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by Tom Brady, in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in league history behind only Aaron Rodgers in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect passer rating. LeSean McCoy finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history passing the previous season high set back in 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagles opened the 2014 season winning their first three games and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games and come back to win.[27] Nick Foles struggled with turnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6ÿ2 record, before breaking his collarbone, resulting in his job getting taken over by Mark Sanchez, who outplayed Foles despite facing more playoff teams. The Eagles held the divisional title from week one to week 15 against the Cowboys. After going 9ÿ3 with their crucial win over Dallas, the Eagles lost their next 3, and a week after losing the NFC East title, they lost an upset against the 3ÿ11 Redskins and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Indianapolis Colts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the 2014 season, Chip Kelly was given total control and made some controversial moves. He traded LeSean McCoy, who had become the team's all-time leading rusher after the 2014 season, for linebacker Kiko Alonso, a player Kelly coached at Oregon who had missed the entire 2014 season.[28] He also cut ten-year veteran and starter, Trent Cole, who was still a consistent threat on defense and was second only to legend Reggie White on the Eagles all-time sack list.[29] He also made a trade where the highly successful Nick Foles was traded for Sam Bradford, who had missed the entire 2014 season with an ACL tear.[30] Kelly tried to re-sign Jeremy Maclin, who had stepped up as the team's leading wide receiver, but he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs instead. However, the Eagles also acquired league leading rusher DeMarco Murray,[31] which not only helped the Eagles, but hurt their rivals, the Dallas Cowboys. They also obtained Super Bowl champion Byron Maxwell,[32] who left the Seattle Seahawks in free agency to sign a six-year, $63 million contract. The first two games of the season were disastrous, as they started 0ÿ2. Bradford had a 2ÿ4 TD-INT ratio, Maxwell was constantly beaten by Falcons receiver Julio Jones, and Murray was held to 11 yards on 21 carries. After Murray was injured, Ryan Mathews rushed for over 100 yards in a Week 3 win against the New York Jets. Kelly made Murray the unquestioned starter and although Murray's play improved over the season, he never regained his dominant form and was held to a career low 3.6 yards per carry average.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 29, 2015, with one game left in the season, head coach Chip Kelly was released by the Eagles after a 6ÿ9 record. Offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur was named Interim Coach for the final game against the rival New York Giants, which Shurmur won 35ÿ30.[33] Former player and current running backs coach Duce Staley was the first coach to be interviewed for the opening head coaching job on January 2, 2016.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagles hired Chiefs offensive coordinator Doug Pederson as their next head coach on January 18, 2016. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Doug is a strategic thinker, a compelling leader and communicator, and someone who truly knows how to get the best out of his players. All of these factors were what initially attracted us to Doug and we believe that he is the right man to help us achieve our ultimate goal.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPederson had been with the Chiefs for the preceding three years after spending the four seasons previous to those with the Eagles. He served as a quality control assistant for the Eagles in 2009 and 2010 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He was praised for his work with Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith over the preceding few seasons, particularly 2015, as the Chiefs moved into the top 10 in scoring offense.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the 2015 season, the Eagles had the 13th pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. They traded Byron Maxwell, Kiko Alonso, and their pick to the Miami Dolphins for the #8 pick. Later, they traded the #8 pick, their third-round pick, their fourth-round pick, a 2017 first-round pick, and a 2018 second-round pick to the Cleveland Browns for the #2 pick and a 2017 fourth-round pick. They used the #2 pick to draft North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz. On September 3, 2016, the Eagles traded starting quarterback Sam Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost Teddy Bridgewater for the season, for a 2017 first-round pick and a 2018 fourth-round pick. Following the trade, the Eagles named Wentz the starting quarterback for Week 1 of the 2016 season.[37] First-time head coach Pederson led the Eagles to a 3ÿ0 start to the season. His rookie quarterback started with 5 touchdowns, no interceptions and over 255 yards per game. The Week 4 bye took a toll on the Eagles, and they lost four out of the next five games, including a loss to every rival team in their division. They also lost right tackle Lane Johnson to a 10-game suspension following the Week 5 loss against the Lions which damaged Carson Wentz's hot start. In those four games, their average margin of loss was just under 5 points.[38] Pederson and the Eagles won only three of their last seven games. Although Wentz started off the season well, the 6ÿ5 quarterback finished with a TDÿINT ratio of 8:7. The rookie head coach and rookie quarterback tandem led the Eagles to a 7ÿ9 record, last in the division.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the following offseason, the team made several acquisitions on the offensive side of the ball. The Eagles either traded or released notable players from the Chip Kelly era like Ryan Mathews, Matt Tobin, Allen Barbre, Jordan Matthews and Marcus Smith II. They signed more notable players to improve its wide receiver corps that have struggled the last two seasons like Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith, as well as two-time Super Bowl champion LeGarrette Blount. They also added veterans on defense such as Patrick Robinson, Chris Long, Corey Graham, Tim Jernigan and Ronald Darby. The team addressed its defense mostly in the draft, using its top three picks on defensive players. The Eagles drafted Derek Barnett with the 14th overall pick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey opened the season on the road versus the Washington Redskins and won the game 30ÿ17. The team lost to the Kansas City Chiefs the following week, 27ÿ20, in Pederson's return to face Andy Reid. The Eagles then won six consecutive games, including a road victory against the Carolina Panthers, 28ÿ23. On the morning of October 31, 2017, just before the NFL trade deadline, the Eagles sent a fourth-round pick to the Dolphins for star running back Jay Ajayi. The move immediately paid dividends for the Eagles heading into their next game versus the Denver Broncos, as Ajayi rushed for 77 yards on just eight attempts including a 46-yard touchdown near the end of the second quarter. The Eagles scored 51 points against the league's best defense, and entered their bye week with the best record in the league (8ÿ1). \\r\\n\\r\\nComing off of the bye week, Philadelphia defeated their bitter enemies, the Dallas Cowboys, 37ÿ9 and then routed the Chicago Bears 31ÿ3.[28] The Eagles nine game win streak was snapped after a 24ÿ10 against the Seahawks at CenturyLink Field. However, the Eagles bounced back in Week 14 road win versus the Los Angeles Rams. Carson Wentz left the game in the third quarter with a knee injury with a torn ACL, and backup Nick Foles would once again take over as starting quarterback. \\r\\n\\r\\nFoles' first start was a comeback from a 20ÿ7 deficit against the New York Giants as he scored four touchdowns and won the game 34ÿ29. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Cowboys, and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in that span. Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the playoffs, the Eagles opened as underdogs, the first time in history that a number 1 seed has opened up the postseason as an underdog. Foles would lead the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15ÿ10. In the NFC Championship, the Eagles annihilated the Minnesota Vikings 38ÿ7, giving the nickname \\"Minneapolis Massacre\\", mocking the Minneapolis Miracle from their previous playoff victory. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns. The Eagles traveled to Minneapolis to compete in Super Bowl LII, their third attempt at a title, against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX from 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Foles at the helm, Philadelphia started off the game strong, leading the Patriots 22ÿ12 at halftime. New England's only lead was by one point in the fourth quarter, 33ÿ32. The Eagles rallied back and scored an 11-yard touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz. The last score of the game was a 46-yard field goal by Jake Elliott to make the final score 41ÿ33. The franchise won their first Super Bowl ever and their first championship since 1960. Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 out of 43 with 373 passing yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the NFL's oldest, this rivalry began on October 15, 1933[39]\\r\\nwhen the Giants defeated the newly founded Eagles 56ÿ0. The Giants lead the all-time series 86ÿ85ÿ2. Three of the best known comebacks against the Giants are labeled as \\"Miracle In The Meadowlands ÿ Herm Edwards\\", \\"Miracle In The Meadowlands II ÿ Brian Westbrook\\" and \\"Miracle In The New Meadowlands ÿ DeSean Jackson\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cowboys have been one of the Eagles' biggest rivals. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27ÿ25 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 63ÿ51ÿ0. They have been close in recent years, with Dallas winning 12 games from 2006 to the present while the Eagles have also won 12. There is much hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl. The rivalry has even spilled over into Draft Weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot as big as the rivalries between the Giants and Cowboys, that with division rivals Washington Redskins is still fierce. It started in 1934 when the Washington Redskins were first known as the Boston Redskins; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6ÿ0, and lead the all-time series 85ÿ76ÿ6. The rivalry has been very even since 2010 overall. However, the Eagles swept the Redskins during the 2017 season for the first time since the 2013 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season, through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970, the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season, the most recent meeting being in 2016 at Lincoln Financial Field, with the Eagles winning 34ÿ3. The Steelers have lost nine straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 47ÿ28ÿ3.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several decades, the Eagles' colors were kelly green, silver, and white. In 1954, the Eagles, along with the Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969, the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from '69ÿ72, the eagle took on a more stylized look. As the design was similar to the Apollo 11 emblem, and its moon-landing craft was dubbed Eagle, players wore the flight's mission patch on their jerseys during 1969.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996. The primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \\"midnight green.\\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed in 1996, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-based style, and the lettering changing from calligraphic to block letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1996 alterations, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly relating to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. Since 2003, the white jerseys along with white pants have been worn during preseason games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though only subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight blue pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season (usually the first home game after bye week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular season home finales, the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost each game. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the \\"alternates\\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules (alternate uniforms are permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals. The black jerseys were most recently used in a December 21, 2016 game against the New York Giants, in which they won 24-19. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black shoes exclusively in 2004. Since 2014, the Eagles have worn the black jersey twice per season. In 2016, they wore the black jersey three times.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \\"throwback\\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and were the same colors used by the former Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to their suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56ÿ21.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they have done it earlier before), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the Dallas Cowboys on November 4, 2007 to make the Cowboys wear their road blue jerseys. Since moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles have worn white at home for at least their home opener, with the exceptions for the 2010 home opener (see next paragraph), the 2011 home opener against the New York Giants, the 2016 home opener against the Cleveland Browns, and the 2017 home opener against the Giants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.[44] In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons respectively before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games. For the 2011 season, the Eagles did not wear white for any of their home games.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2012 season Nike took over from Reebok as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \\"Elite 51\\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo), other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2013 season, the Eagles started to wear white pants, as an alternate to their green pants, with their white jerseys, in the regular season.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2014 season the Eagles have officially adopted the \\"Elite 51 style uniform from Nike. Recently the team has discussed bringing back the \\"Kelly Green\\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season and which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally kelly green, silver and white had been the official team color until 1996 season when it switched to the current \\"Midnight Green\\" uniforms. But due to the NFL rules and restrictions having a team go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, it would most likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set, the Eagles won the game 27ÿ0. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. The blackout uniform was most recently worn in a Week 16 victory, 19-10, against the Raiders in 2017. The Eagles are 6ÿ3 in their blackout uniforms: winning three times against the Giants and once against each of the Minnesota Vikings, Denver Broncos, and Oakland Raiders, and losing against the Seattle Seahawks, Arizona Cardinals, and Green Bay Packers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eagles previously held their preseason training camp from the end of July through mid-August each year at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley.[45] With the addition of head coach Chip Kelly, the Eagles in 2013, moved their training camp to the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia.[46][47] Training camps were previously held at Chestnut Hill Academy in 1935, Saint Joseph's University in 1939 and 1943, Saranac Lake from 1946 to 1948, Hershey from 1951 to 1967, Albright College from 1968 to 1972, Widener University from 1973 to 1979, and West Chester University from 1980 to 1995.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fight song is heard during Eagles' home games after touchdowns and before the team is introduced prior to kickoff.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the method may vary, studies that attempt to rank the 32 fan bases in the NFL consistently place Eagles fans among the best in the league, noting their \\"unmatched fervor.\\"[48] Eagles fans have numerous dedicated web communities, ranking the Eagles just behind the Phillies as the dominant Philadelphia sports presence on the web.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American City Business Journals, which conducts a regular study to determine the most loyal fans in the NFL, evaluates fans based primarily on attendance-related factors,[50] and ranked Eagles fans third in both 1999[51] and 2006.[52] The 2006 study called the fans \\"incredibly loyal\\", noting that they filled 99.8% of the seats in the stadium over the previous decade.[53] Forbes placed the Eagles fans first in its 2008 survey,[54] which was based on the correlation between team performance and fan attendance.[55] ESPN.com placed Eagles fans fourth in the league in its 2008 survey, citing the connection between the team's performance and the mood of the city.[56] The last home game which was blacked out on television in the Philadelphia market as a result of not being sold out was against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, September 12, 1999, which was Andy Reid's first home game as new head coach of the Eagles.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe studies note thatwin or loseEagles fans can be counted on to pack their stadium. As of August 2008, the team had sold out 71 consecutive games, and 70,000 were on the team's waiting list for season tickets.[56] Despite finishing with a 6ÿ10 record in the 2005 season, the Eagles ranked second in the NFL in merchandise sales, and single-game tickets for the next season were sold out minutes after phone and Internet lines opened.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nEagles fans have also been known to chant the famous, \\"E-A-G-L-E-S ÿ Eagles!\\" at Flyers, Phillies, and 76ers games when the team is getting blown out late in a game and a loss is inevitable, signifying their displeasure with the given team's performance, and that they are instead putting their hope into the Eagles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with their fierce devotion, Eagles fans have a reputation for bad behavior and sports-related violence, especially when the team plays its rivals.[58] In If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?, Jere Longman described the fans of the 700 Level of Veterans Stadium as having a reputation for \\"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness.\\"[59] So many incidents occurred at a 1997 game against the 49ers that at the following home game, Judge Seamus McCaffery began presiding over a temporary courtroom at the stadium; 20 suspects came before him that day.[58] Fan behavior improved after the team's move to Lincoln Financial Field, and \\"Eagles Court\\" ended in December 2003.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team also has its own cheerleading squad, which performs a variety of dance moves for the fans and the Eagles on the sideline.[61] The squad also releases a swimsuit calendar each year, and is the first squad in the league to release the calendar on the Android and iOS mobile systems.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nRunning backs\\r\\n\\r\\nWide receivers\\r\\n\\r\\nTight ends\\r\\n\\r\\nDefensive linemen\\r\\n\\r\\nDefensive backs\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial teams\\r\\n\\r\\nPractice squad\\r\\n\\r\\nRoster updated October 24, 2018\\r\\nDepth chart ?

The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale, a 30-year-old bartender and part-time school teacher, and also a diehard Eagles fan who became an Eagles player. The film differs slightly from true events as the selection process was invitation only, and Papale had at least some previous playing experience.[69] The film Silver Linings Playbook highlights the 2008 Philadelphia Eagles season. The film was critically acclaimed and nominated for several awards including 8 Academy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1978 Academy Award-winning movie The Deer Hunter, the Eagles are referenced when Nick talks to Stan in the bar, saying: \\"Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles never cross the fifty in the next half and Oakland wins by 20!\\" Stan responds; \\"And I got an extra twenty says the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!\\"[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe award-winning comedy series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia starring Danny DeVito makes several references to the Philadelphia Eagles, most notably Season 3, Episode 2 ÿ \\"The Gang Gets Invincible,\\" the title being a reference to the Wahlberg film.[71]","input":"What number super bowl did the eagles win?"},{"output":"Palmeiras","context":"Gabriel Fernando de Jesus (born 3 April 1997), commonly known as Gabriel Jesus (Portuguese pronunciation:?[ab?i?ew ???zus]), is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester City and the Brazil national team.\\r\\nJesus began his career at Palmeiras.

He did not make any senior appearances during the campaign, as his side was seriously threatened with relegation;[8] this decision, took by managers Ricardo Gareca and Dorival J~nior, was widely criticized by the supporters, who demanded a change for the youngster through a petition.[9]\\r\\nJesus made his senior debut on 7 March 2015 in the season's Campeonato Paulista, replacing Leandro Pereira in the 73rd minute of a 1ÿ0 win over CA Bragantino at Allianz Parque.[10] He totalled eight appearances, all off the bench, as the Verd?o lost on a penalty shootout in the final against Santos.\\r\\nJesus made his first career start on 29 April in the second leg of the second round of the year's cup, a 1ÿ1 draw at Sampaio Corra Futebol Clube (6ÿ2 aggregate).

Malagasy agriculture produces tropical staple crops such as rice and cassava, as well as cash crops such as vanilla and coffee. Madagascar's wealth of natural resources supports its sizable mining industry. Additionally, Madagascar's status as a developing nation exempts Malagasy exports from customs protocol in some areas, notably the United States and European Union. These exemptions have supported the growth of the Malagasy textile industry. Despite Madagascar's natural resources and developing industries, the 2009 Malagasy political crisisconsidered by the international community to be an illegal coup[3]deterred foreign investments in Madagascar and caused the Malagasy economy to decline.[4] Foreign investments have resumed following the resumption of elections in early 2014.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture, including fishing and forestry, is Madagascar's largest industry and employs 82% of its labor force.[2] Madagascar's varied climate, ranging from tropical along the coasts, moderate in the highlands and arid in the south, allows for the cultivation of tropical crops such as rice, cassava, beans and bananas.[2] In 2011, agricultural productsespecially cloves, vanilla, cacao, sugar, pepper, and coffeeaccounted for Madagascar's top twelve exports by value.[5] Madagascar produces the second largest vanilla harvest in the world and Malagasy vanilla accounts for about a quarter of the global vanilla market.[6]\\r\\nExports from Madagascars' Export Processing Zones, located around Antananarivo and Antsirabe, account for the majority of garment exports[citation needed] and are largely exempt from customs restrictions in the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)[7] and in the European Union under the Everything But Arms (EBA) agreement.[8]\\r\\nA small but growing part of the economy is based on mining of ilmenite, with investments emerging in recent years, particularly near Tulear and Fort Dauphin.[9] Mining corporation Rio Tinto Group started production at its Fort Dauphin mine in January 2009,[10] following several years of preparation. The mining project is highly controversial, with Friends of the Earth and other environmental organizations filing reports to detail their concerns about the mine's effect on the environment and local communities.[11] Gemstone mining is also an important part of Madagascar's economy.\\r\\nSeveral major projects are underway in the mining and oil and gas sectors that, if successful, will give a significant boost. In the mining sector, these include the development of coal at Sakoa and nickel near Tamatave. The Ambatovy nickel mine (Sherrit International 40%, Sumitomo 27.5%, Korea Resources 27.5%, SNC-Lavalin 5%) is a huge operation and has cost USD $4.76 million to date [12] and is due to start production in 2011. In oil, Madagascar Oil is developing the massive onshore heavy oil field at Tsimiroro and ultra heavy oil field at Bemolanga.\\r\\nFollowing the 2002 political crisis, the government attempted to set a new course and build confidence, in coordination with international financial institutions and donors.

Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the new government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years.

President Ravalomanana rose to prominence through his agro-foods TIKO company, and is known for attempting to apply many of the lessons learned in the world of business to running the government. Prior to Ravalomanana's resignation, concerns had arisen about the conflict of interest between his policies and the activities of his firms. Most notable among them the preferential treatment for rice imports initiated by the government in late 2004 when responding to a production shortfall in the country.\\r\\nMadagascars appeal to investors stems from its competitive, trainable work force. More than 200 investors, particularly garment manufacturers, were organized under the countrys export processing zone (EPZ) system since it was established in 1989. The absence of quota limits on textile imports to the European market under the Lome Convention helped stimulate this growth.\\r\\nGrowth in output in 1992ÿ97 averaged less than the growth rate of the population. Growth has been held back by a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic commitment of the government to economic reform.[14][15] During a period of solid growth from 1997 to 2001, poverty levels remained stubbornly high, especially in rural areas. A six-month political crisis triggered by a dispute over the outcome of the presidential elections held in December 2001 virtually halted economic activity in much of the country in the first half of 2002. Real GDP dropped 12.7% in 2002, inflows of foreign investment dropped sharply, and the crisis tarnished Madagascar's budding reputation as an AGOA standout and a promising place to invest. After the crisis, the economy rebounded with GDP growth of over 10% in 2003. Currency depreciation and rising inflation in 2004 hampered economic performance, but growth for the year reached 5.3%, with inflation reaching around 25% at the end of the year. In 2005 inflation was brought under control by tight monetary policy of raising the Taux Directeur (central bank rate) to 16% and tightening reserve requirements for banks. Thus growth was expected to reach around 6.5% in 2005.\\r\\nFollowing the 2002 political crisis, the government attempted to set a new course and build confidence, in coordination with international financial institutions and donors. Madagascar developed a recovery plan in collaboration with the private sector and donors and presented it at a \\"Friends of Madagascar\\" conference organized by the World Bank in Paris in July 2002. Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the new government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years. The Malagasy Government identified road infrastructure as its principle priority and underlined its commitment to public-private partnership by establishing a joint public-private sector steering committee.\\r\\nThe Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed as a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Malagasian artisan producers in Madagascar in 2002.[13] The U.S.-Madagascar Business Council was formed in the United States in May 2003, and the two organisations continue to explore ways to work for the benefit of both groups.\\r\\nDespite a wealth of abundant and diverse natural resources, Madagascar is one of the worlds poorest countries. Madagascar holds great potential for agricultural development, mainly due to the large variety of soil types and climatic diversity. Nevertheless, natural hazards (cyclones, drought, locust invasions) combined with old-fashioned farming practices limit production.\\r\\nThe standard of living of the Malagasy population has been declining dramatically over the past 25 years. The country has gone from being a net exporter of agricultural products in the 1960s to a net importer since 1971. Inappropriate traditional agricultural methods cause soil to erode and soil quality to decline, and the basis of survival for Madagascars people is under serious threat.[16]\\r\\nIn 2000, Madagascar embarked on the preparation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The boards of the IMF and of the World Bank concurred in December 2000 that the country was eligible under the HIPC Initiative, and Madagascar reached the decision point for debt relief. On March 1, 2001, the IMF Board granted the country $103 million for 2001ÿ03 under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGR). Resources were intended for improving access to health, education, rural roads, water, and direct support to communities. In addition, on March 7, 2001, the Paris Club approved a debt cancellation of $161 million. On February 28, 2001, the African Development Bank (ADB) approved under the HIPC a debt cancellation of $71.46 million and granted in June 2001 an additional credit of $20 million to fight against AIDS and poverty.\\r\\nPartly as a result of these credits but also as a result of previous reforms, average GDP growth exceeded the population growth rate of 2.8% in 1997 (3.5%), 1998 (3.9%), 1999 (4.7%) and 2000 (4.8%).\\r\\nIn October 2004, the boards of the IMF and the World Bank determined that Madagascar had reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.\\r\\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\\r\\nlowest 10%: 2.3%\\r\\nhighest 10%: 34.9% (1993)\\r\\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1999 est.)\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ production: 1.35 billion kWh (2009 est.)\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ production by source:\\r\\nfossil fuel: 69.5%\\r\\nhydro: 30.5%\\r\\nnuclear: 0%\\r\\nother: 0% (2009)\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ consumption: 1.256 billion kWh (2009 est.)\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ exports: 0 kWh (2010)\\r\\nElectricity?ÿ imports: 0 kWh (2010)\\r\\nExchange rates: Malagasy ariary (MGA) per US dollar - 2,195 (2012 est.) 2,025.1 (2011 est.) 2,090 (2010 est.) 1,956.2 (2009) 1,654.78 (2008)\\r\\nThe population below the provety line is 50 percent","input":"What kind of economic system does madagascar have?"},{"output":"about one million people","context":"","input":"How many were killed in the irish potato famine?"},{"output":"8 November 1942","context":"Coordinates: 350506N 20144W? / ?35.085N 2.029W? / 35.085; -2.029\\r\\nAllied victory\\r\\n?United States\\r\\n?United Kingdom\\r\\n?Free France\\r\\n?Canada\\r\\n?Netherlands\\r\\n Vichy France\\r\\n Fran?ois Darlan\\r\\n Charles Nogus\\r\\n Frix Michelier\\r\\nOperation Torch (initially called Operation Gymnast) was the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African Campaign of the Second World War which started on 8 November 1942. It is the first major operation that US troops undertook in the European / North African theatre of World War II.[4]\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had pressed the US and British to start operations in Europe and open a second front to reduce the pressure of German forces on the Soviet troops. While US commanders favored Operation Sledgehammer, landing in Occupied Europe as soon as possible, British commanders believed that such a course was likely to end in disaster.[5] Landings in French North Africa were instead proposed. On July 28, the Axis Afrika Korps, under General Erwin Rommel, captured Mersa Matruh, in Egypt, only 140 miles (230?km) from Alexandria. Landings to the west would reduce pressure on Allied forces in Egypt. They would also secure Allied naval control of the south-west Mediterranean, and enable an invasion of Southern Europe later in 1943. U.S. President, Roosevelt, suspected that landings in north-west Africa would rule out an invasion of Europe in 1943 but agreed to support British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.[6]\\r\\nSenior US commanders remained strongly opposed to the landings. After the Western Allies' Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) met in Washington on July 30, General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest King declined to approve the plan. When Roosevelt was told of this, he was furious,[citation needed] called Marshall and King to the White House, and gave a direct order that Torch was to have precedence over other operations and was to take place at the earliest possible date. This was one of only two direct orders he gave to military commanders during the war.[7] (The other was in March 1943, when Roosevelt ordered King to transfer 60 B-24 Liberators from the Pacific to the Atlantic, to combat U-Boats.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies planned an Anglo-American invasion of north-western Africa/MaghrebMorocco, Algeria and Tunisia, territory nominally in the hands of the Vichy French government. With much of North Africa already under Allied control, this would allow the Allies to carry out a pincer operation against Axis forces in North Africa. The Vichy French had around 125,000 soldiers in the territories as well as coastal artillery, 210 operational but out-of-date tanks and about 500 aircraft, half of which were Dewoitine D.520 fightersequal to many British and U.S. fighters.[8] These forces included 60,000 troops in Morocco, 15,000 in Tunisia, and 50,000 in Algeria, with coastal artillery, and a small number of tanks and aircraft.[9] In addition, there were 10 or so warships and 11 submarines at Casablanca.\\r\\nThe Allies believed that the Vichy French forces would not fight, partly because of information supplied by American Consul Robert Daniel Murphy in Algiers. The French were former Allies of the U.S. and the American troops were instructed not to fire unless they were fired upon.[10] However, they harbored suspicions that the Vichy French navy would bear a grudge over the British attack on Mers-el-Kebir in 1940. An assessment of the sympathies of the French forces in North Africa was essential, and plans were made to secure their cooperation, rather than resistance. German support for the Vichy French came in the shape of air support. Several Luftwaffe bomber wings undertook anti-shipping strikes against Allied ports in Algiers and along the North African coast.\\r\\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower was given command of the operation, and he set up his headquarters in Gibraltar. The Allied Naval Commander of the Expeditionary Force would be Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham; his deputy was Vice-Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, who would plan the amphibious landings.\\r\\nPlanners identified Oran and also Algiers and Casablanca as key targets. Ideally there would also be a landing at Tunis to secure Tunisia and facilitate the rapid interdiction of supplies travelling via Tripoli to Rommel's forces in Libya. However, Tunis was much too close to the Axis airfields in Sicily and Sardinia for any hope of success. A compromise would be to land at B?ne (Annaba) in eastern Algeria, some 300 miles (480?km) closer to Tunis than Algiers. Limited resources dictated that the Allies could only make three landings and Eisenhowerwho believed that any plan must include landings at Oran and Algiershad two main options: either the western option, to land at Casablanca, Oran and Algiers and then make as rapid a move as possible to Tunis some 500 miles (800?km) east of Algiers once the Vichy opposition was suppressed; or the eastern option, to land at Oran, Algiers and B?ne and then advance overland to Casablanca some 500 miles (800?km) west of Oran. He favoured the eastern option because of the advantages it gave to an early capture of Tunis and also because the Atlantic swells off Casablanca presented considerably greater risks to an amphibious landing there than would be encountered in the Mediterranean.\\r\\nThe Combined Chiefs of Staff, however, were concerned that should Operation Torch precipitate Spain to abandon neutrality and join the Axis, the Straits of Gibraltar could be closed cutting the entire Allied force's lines of communication. They therefore chose the Casablanca option as the less risky since the forces in Algeria and Tunisia could be supplied overland from Casablanca (albeit with considerable difficulty) in the event of closure of the straits.[11]\\r\\nMarshalls opposition to Torch delayed the landings by almost a month, and his opposition to landings in Algeria led British military leaders to question his strategic ability; the Royal Navy controlled the Strait of Gibraltar, and Spain was unlikely to intervene as Franco was hedging his bets. The Morocco landings ruled out the early occupation of Tunisia. Eisenhower told Patton that the past six weeks were the most trying of his life.[12] In Eisenhower's acceptance of landings in Algeria and Morocco he pointed out that the decision removed the early capture of Tunis from the probable to only the remotely possible because of the extra time it would afford the Axis to move forces into Tunisia.[13]\\r\\nIn July 1941, Mieczys?aw S?owikowski (using the codename \\"Rygor\\"Polish for \\"Rigor\\") set up \\"Agency Africa\\", one of the Second World War's most successful intelligence organizations.[14] His Polish allies in these endeavors included Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ci??ki. The information gathered by the Agency was used by the Americans and British in planning the amphibious November 1942 Operation Torch[15][16] landings in North Africa.\\r\\nTo gauge the feeling of the Vichy French forces, Murphy was appointed to the American consulate in Algeria. His covert mission was to determine the mood of the French forces and to make contact with elements that might support an Allied invasion. He succeeded in contacting several French officers, including General Charles Mast, the French commander-in-chief in Algiers.\\r\\nThese officers were willing to support the Allies but asked for a clandestine conference with a senior Allied General in Algeria. Major General Mark W. Clarkone of Eisenhower's senior commanderswas dispatched to Cherchell in Algeria aboard the British submarine HMS?Seraph and met with these Vichy French officers on 21 October 1942.\\r\\nWith help from the Resistance, the Allies also succeeded in slipping French General Henri Giraud out of Vichy France on HMS Seraphpassing itself off as an American submarineintending to offer him the post of commander in chief of French forces in North Africa after the invasion. However, Giraud would take no position lower than commander in chief of all the invading forces, a job already given to Eisenhower. When he was refused, he decided to remain \\"a spectator in this affair\\".\\r\\nThe Allies organised three amphibious task forces to simultaneously seize the key ports and airports in Morocco and Algeria, targeting Casablanca, Oran and Algiers. Successful completion of these operations was to be followed by an eastwards advance into Tunisia.\\r\\nA Western Task Force (aimed at Casablanca) was composed of American units, with Major General George S. Patton in command and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt heading the naval operations. This Western Task Force consisted of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division and the U.S. 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions35,000?troops in a convoy of over 100?ships. They were transported directly from the United States in the first of a new series of UG convoys providing logistic support for the North African campaign.[17]\\r\\nThe Center Task Force, aimed at Oran, included the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, and the U.S. 1st Armored Divisiona total of 18,500?troops. They sailed from the United Kingdom and were commanded by Major General Lloyd Fredendall, the naval forces being commanded by Commodore Thomas Troubridge.\\r\\nTorch was, for propaganda purposes, a landing by U.S. forces, supported by British warships and aircraft, under the belief that this would be more palatable to French public opinion, than an Anglo-American invasion. For the same reason, Churchill suggested that British soldiers might wear U.S. Army uniforms, although there is no evidence that this tactic was implemented.[18] (Fleet Air Arm aircraft did carry US \\"star\\" roundels during the operation,[19] and two British destroyers flew the Stars and Stripes.[18]) In reality, the Eastern Task Forceaimed at Algierswas commanded by Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson and consisted of a brigade from the British 78th and the U.S. 34th Infantry Divisions, along with two British commando units (No.?1 and No.?6 Commandos), totaling 20,000?troops. During the landing phase, ground forces were to be commanded by U.S. Major General Charles W. Ryder, Commanding General (CG) of the 34th Division and naval forces were commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Harold Burrough.\\r\\nU-boats, operating in the eastern Atlantic area crossed by the invasion convoys, had been drawn away to attack trade convoy SL 125. Some historians have suggested the timing of this trade convoy was an intentional tactical diversion to prevent submarine attacks on the troop transports.[20]\\r\\nAerial operations were split into two, east of Cape Tenez in Algeria, with British aircraft under Air Marshal Sir William Welsh and west of Cape Tenez, all American aircraft under Major General Jimmy Doolittle, under the direct command of Major General Patton.\\r\\nP-40s of the 33rd Fighter Group were launched from U.S. Navy escort carriers and landed at Port Lyautey on November 10. Additional air support was provided by the carrier USS?Ranger, whose squadrons intercepted Vichy aircraft and bombed hostile ships.\\r\\nThe Western Task Force landed before daybreak on 8 November 1942, at three points in Morocco: Safi (Operation Blackstone), Fedala (Operation Brushwood, the largest landing with 19,000?men), and Mehdiya-Port Lyautey (Operation Goalpost). Because it was hoped that the French would not resist, there were no preliminary bombardments. This proved to be a costly error as French defenses took a toll of American landing forces.\\r\\nOn the night of 7 November, pro-Allied General Antoine Bthouart attempted a coup d'etat against the French command in Morocco, so that he could surrender to the Allies the next day. His forces surrounded the villa of General Charles Nogus, the Vichy-loyal high commissioner. However, Nogus telephoned loyal forces, who stopped the coup. In addition, the coup attempt alerted Nogus to the impending Allied invasion, and he immediately bolstered French coastal defenses.\\r\\nAt Safi, the objective being capturing the port facilities to land the Western Task Force's medium tanks, the landings were mostly successful.[21] The landings were begun without covering fire, in the hope that the French would not resist at all. However, once French coastal batteries opened fire, Allied warships returned fire. By the time General Ernest Harmon's 2nd Armored Division arrived, French snipers had pinned the assault troops (most of whom were in combat for the first time) on Safi's beaches. Most of the landings occurred behind schedule. Carrier aircraft destroyed a French truck convoy bringing reinforcements to the beach defenses. Safi surrendered on the afternoon of 8 November. By 10 November, the remaining defenders were pinned down, and the bulk of Harmon's forces raced to join the siege of Casablanca.\\r\\nAt Port-Lyautey, the landing troops were uncertain of their position, and the second wave was delayed. This gave the French defenders time to organize resistance, and the remaining landings were conducted under artillery bombardment. With the assistance of air support from the carriers, the troops pushed ahead, and the objectives were captured.\\r\\nAt Fedala, weather disrupted the landings. The landing beaches again came under French fire after daybreak. Patton landed at 08:00, and the beachheads were secured later in the day. The Americans surrounded the port of Casablanca by 10 November, and the city surrendered an hour before the final assault was due to take place.\\r\\nCasablanca was the principal French Atlantic naval base after German occupation of the European coast. The Naval Battle of Casablanca resulted from a sortie of French cruisers, destroyers, and submarines opposing the landings. A cruiser, six destroyers, and six submarines were destroyed by American gunfire and aircraft. The incomplete French battleship Jean Bartwhich was docked and immobilefired on the landing force with her one working gun turret until disabled by the 16-inch calibre American naval gunfire of the USS Massachusetts, the first such heavy-calibre shells fired by the U.S. Navy anywhere in World War II. Two U.S. destroyers were damaged.\\r\\nThe Center Task Force was split between three beaches, two west of Oran and one east. Landings at the westernmost beach were delayed because of a French convoy which appeared while the minesweepers were clearing a path. Some delay and confusion, and damage to landing ships, was caused by the unexpected shallowness of water and sandbars; although periscope observations had been carried out, no reconnaissance parties had landed on the beaches to determine the local maritime conditions. This was in contrast to later amphibious assaultssuch as Operation Overlordin which considerable weight was given to pre-invasion reconnaissance.\\r\\nThe U.S. 1st Ranger Battalion landed east of Oran and quickly captured the shore battery at Arzew. An attempt was made to land U.S. infantry at the harbour directly, in order to quickly prevent destruction of the port facilities and scuttling of ships. The operationcode named Operation Reservistfailed, as the two Banff-class sloops were destroyed by crossfire from the French vessels there. The Vichy French naval fleet broke from the harbor and attacked the Allied invasion fleet, but its ships were all sunk or driven ashore.[22]\\r\\nFrench batteries and the invasion fleet exchanged fire throughout 8ÿ9 November, with French troops defending Oran and the surrounding area stubbornly. Heavy fire from the British battleships brought about Oran's surrender on 9 November.\\r\\nTorch was the first major airborne assault carried out by the United States. The 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment flew all the way from Britain, over Spain, intending to drop near Oran and capture airfields at Tafraoui and La Snia, respectively 15 miles (24?km) and 5 miles (8?km) south of Oran.[23] The operation was marked by weather, navigational and communication problems. Poor weather over Spain and the extreme range caused the formation to scatter and forced thirty of the 37 aircraft to land in the dry salt lake to the west of the objective.[24] Nevertheless, both airports were captured.\\r\\nAs agreed at Churchell, in the early hours of 8 November, 400 mainly Jewish French Resistance fighters[25] staged a coup in the city of Algiers. Starting at midnight, the force under the command of Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie and Jos Aboulker seized key targets, including the telephone exchange, radio station, governor's house and the headquarters of 19th Corps.\\r\\nRobert Murphy took some men and then drove to the residence of General Alphonse Juin, the senior French Army officer in North Africa. While they surrounded his house (making Juin effectively a prisoner) Murphy attempted to persuade him to side with the Allies. However, he was treated to a surprise: Admiral Fran?ois Darlanthe commander of all French forceswas also in Algiers on a private visit. Juin insisted on contacting Darlan, and Murphy was unable to persuade either to side with the Allies. In the early morning, the local Gendarmerie arrived and released both Juin and Darlan.\\r\\nOn 8 November 1942, the invasion commenced with landings split between three beachestwo west of Algiers and one east. Under overall command of Major General Charles W. Ryder, Commanding General of the U.S. 34th Infantry Division, British 11th Brigade Group from the British 78th Infantry Division, landed on the right hand beach, U.S. 168th Regimental Combat Team, from the 34th Infantry Division, supported by 6th Commando and most of 1st Commando on the middle beach while the U.S. 39th Regimental Combat Team, also from the U.S. 34th Division, supported by the remaining 5 troops from 1st Commando landed on the left hand beach. The British 36th Brigade Group from the British 78th Division stood by in floating reserve.[26] Though some landings went to the wrong beaches, this was immaterial because of the extremely low level of French opposition. All the coastal batteries had been neutralized by French resistance, and one French commander openly welcomed the landing Allies. The only fighting took place in the port of Algiers, where in Operation Terminal, two British destroyers attempted to land a party of U.S. Army Rangers directly onto the dock, in order to prevent the French destroying the port facilities and scuttling their ships. Heavy artillery fire prevented one destroyer from landing, but the other was able to disembark 250 Rangers before it too was driven back to sea.[22] The landed troops pushed quickly inland and General Juin surrendered the city to the Allies at 18:00.\\r\\nIt quickly became clear that Giraud lacked the authority to take command of the French forces. He preferred to wait in Gibraltar for the results of the landing. However, Darlan in Algiers had such authority. Eisenhower, with the support of Roosevelt and Churchill, made an agreement with Darlan, recognizing him as French \\"High Commissioner\\" in North Africa. In return, Darlan ordered all French forces in North Africa to cease resistance to the Allies and to cooperate instead. The deal was made on 10 November, and French resistance ceased almost at once. The French troops in North Africa who were not already captured submitted to and eventually joined the Allied forces.[27] Men from French North Africa would see much combat under the Allied banner as part of the French Expeditionary Corps (consisting of 112,000 troops in April 1944) in the Italian campaign, where Maghrebis (mostly Moroccans) made up over 60% of the unit's soldiers.[28]\\r\\nWhen Adolf Hitler learned of Darlan's deal with the Allies, he immediately ordered the occupation of Vichy France and sent troops to Tunisia.\\r\\nThe Eisenhower/Darlan agreement meant that the officials appointed by the Vichy regime would remain in power in North Africa. No role was provided for Free France, which was supposed to be France's government-in-exile, and which had taken charge in other French colonies. This deeply offended Charles de Gaulle as head of Free France. It also offended much of the British and American public, who regarded all Vichy French as Nazi collaborators, and Darlan as one of the worst. Eisenhower insisted however that he had no real choice if his forces were to move on against the Axis in Tunisia, rather than fight the French in Algeria and Morocco.\\r\\nThough de Gaulle had no official power in North Africa, much of the population now publicly declared Free French allegiance, putting pressure on Darlan. Then on 24 December, Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a French resistance fighter and anti-fascist monarchist, assassinated Darlan. (Bonnier de La Chapelle was arrested on the spot and executed two days later.)\\r\\nGiraud succeeded Darlan but like him replaced few of the Vichy officials. He even ordered the arrest of the leaders of the Algiers coup of 8 November, with no opposition from Murphy.\\r\\nThe French North African government gradually became active in the Allied war-effort. The weak French troops in Tunisia did not resist German troops arriving by air; Admiral Esteva, the commander there, obeyed orders to that effect from Vichy. The Germans took the airfields there and brought in more troops. The French troops withdrew to the west, and within a few days began to skirmish against the Germans, encouraged by small American and British detachments who had reached the area. While this was of minimal military effect, it committed the French to the Allied side. Later all French forces were withdrawn from action to be properly re-equipped by the Allies.\\r\\nGiraud supported this but also preferred to maintain the old Vichy administration in North Africa. Under pressure from the Allies and from de Gaulle's supporters, the French rgime shifted, with Vichy officials gradually replaced, and its more offensive decrees rescinded. In June 1943 Giraud and de Gaulle agreed to form the \\"Comit fran?ais de Libration nationale\\" (CFLN), with members from both the North African government and from de Gaulle's \\"French National Committee\\". In November 1943 de Gaulle became head of the CFLN, and de jure head of government of France, recognized by the U.S. and Britain.\\r\\nIn another political outcome of Torch (and at Darlan's orders), the previously Vichyite government of French West Africa joined the Allies.\\r\\nOne of the terms the Second Armistice at Compigne agreed to by the Germans was that southern France would remain free of German occupation and self-governed from Vichy. The lack of determined resistance by the Vichy French to the Allied invasions of North Africa and the new de Gaulle policies in North Africa convinced the Germans that France could not be trusted. Moreover, the Anglo-American presence in French North Africa invalidated the only real rationale for not occupying the whole of Metropolitan Franceit was the only practical means to deny the Allies use of the French colonies. The Germans immediately occupied southern France and German troops moved to seize the French fleet in the port of Toulon. The naval strength of the Axis in the Mediterranean would have been greatly increased if the Germans had succeeded in seizing the French ships, but every important ship was scuttled at dock by the French Navy before the Germans could take them.\\r\\nAfter the German and Italian occupation of Vichy France and their unsuccessful attempt to capture the interned French fleet at Toulon (Operation Lila), the French Arme dAfrique sided with the Allies, providing a third corps (XIX Corps) for Anderson. Elsewhere, French warshipssuch as the battleship Richelieurejoined the Allies.\\r\\nOn 9 November, Axis forces started to build up in Tunisia unopposed by the local French forces under General Barr. Wracked with indecision, Barr moved his troops into the hills and formed a defensive line from Teboursouk through Medjez el Bab and ordered that anyone trying to pass through the line would be shot. On 19 November, the German commanderWalter Nehringdemanded passage for his troops across the bridge at Medjez and was refused. The Germans attacked the poorly equipped French units twice and were driven back. However, the French had taken heavy casualties and, lacking artillery and armor, Barr was forced to withdraw.[29]\\r\\nAfter consolidating in Algeria, the Allies struck into Tunisia. Elements of the British First Army under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson came to within 40 miles (64?km) of Tunis before a counterattack at Djedeida thrust them back. In January 1943, German and Italian troops under Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommelretreating westward from Libyareached Tunisia.\\r\\nThe British Eighth Army in the eastcommanded by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomerystopped around Tripoli to allow reinforcements to arrive and build up the Allied advantage and to repair the port there. In the west, the forces of the First Army came under attack at the end of January, being forced back from the Fa?d Pass and then suffering a reversal at Sidi Bou Zid on 14ÿ15 February. Axis forces pushed on to Sbeitla and then to the Kasserine Pass on 19 February, where the U.S. II Corps retreated in disarray until heavy Allied reinforcements halted the Axis advance on 22 February. Fredendall was replaced by George Patton.\\r\\nGeneral Sir Harold Alexander arrived in Tunisia in late February to take charge of the new 18th Army Group headquarters, which had been created to take overall control of both the Eighth Army and the Allied forces already fighting in Tunisia. The Axis forces again attacked eastward at Medenine on 6 March but were easily repulsed by the Eighth Army. Rommel counselled Hitler to allow a full retreat to a defensible line but was denied, and on 9 March Rommel left Tunisia to be replaced by Jrgen von Arnim, who had to spread his forces over 100 miles (160?km) of northern Tunisia.\\r\\nThe setbacks at Kasserine forced the Allies to consolidate their forces and develop their lines of communication and administration so that they could support a major attack. The First and Eighth Armies then attacked the Axis in April. Hard fighting followed, but the Allies cut off the Germans and Italians from support by naval and air forces between Tunisia and Sicily.

In many contexts, potato refers to the edible tuber, but it can also refer to the plant itself.[2] Common or slang terms include tater and spud.  Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWild potato species can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to southern Chile.[4] The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations,[5] but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000ÿ10,000 years ago.[6][7][8] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 1,000 different types of potatoes.[7]  Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile, which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially eastern and central Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a nightshade similar to tomatoes, the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine and are not fit for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English word potato comes from Spanish patata (the name used in Spain). The Spanish Royal Academy says the Spanish word is a hybrid of the Tano batata (sweet potato)  and the Quechua papa (potato).[13][14] The name originally referred to the sweet potato although the two plants are not closely related.  The 16th-century English herbalist John Gerard referred to sweet potatoes as \\"common potatoes\\", and used the terms \\"bastard potatoes\\" and \\"Virginia potatoes\\" for the species we now call \\"potato\\".[15]  In many of the chronicles detailing agriculture and plants, no distinction is made between the two.[16]  Potatoes are occasionally referred to as \\"Irish potatoes\\" or \\"white potatoes\\" in the United States, to distinguish them from sweet potatoes.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name spud for a small potato comes from the digging of soil (or a hole) prior to the planting of potatoes. The word has an unknown origin and was originally (c. 1440) used as a term for a short knife or dagger, probably related to the Latin \\"spad-\\" a word root meaning \\"sword\\"; cf. Spanish \\"espada\\", English \\"spade\\" and \\"spadroon\\". It subsequently transferred over to a variety of digging tools. Around 1845, the name transferred to the tuber itself, the first record of this usage being in New Zealand English.[17] The origin of the word \\"spud\\" has erroneously been attributed to an 18th-century activist group dedicated to keeping the potato out of Britain, calling itself The Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet (S.P.U.D.). It was Mario Pei's 1949 The Story of Language that can be blamed for the word's false origin. Pei writes, \\"the potato, for its part, was in disrepute some centuries ago. Some Englishmen who did not fancy potatoes formed a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet. The initials of the main words in this title gave rise to spud.\\" Like most other pre-20th century acronymic origins, this is false, and there is no evidence that a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet ever existed.[18][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato plants are herbaceous perennials that grow about 60?cm (24?in) high, depending on variety, with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple flowers with yellow stamens. In general, the tubers of varieties with white flowers have white skins, while those of varieties with colored flowers tend to have pinkish skins.[19] Potatoes are mostly cross-pollinated by insects such as bumblebees, which carry pollen from other potato plants, though a substantial amount of self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter flowering, potato plants produce small green fruits that resemble green cherry tomatoes, each containing about 300 seeds. Like all parts of the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic alkaloid solanine and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called \\"true potato seed\\", \\"TPS\\" or \\"botanical seed\\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be propagated vegetatively by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide. Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone, mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. They belong to eight or nine species, depending on the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties, there are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species. Genetically modified varieties have met public resistance in the United States and in the European Union.[21][22] \\r\\n\\r\\nThe major species grown worldwide is Solanum tuberosum (a tetraploid with 48 chromosomes), and modern varieties of this species are the most widely cultivated. There are also four diploid species (with 24 chromosomes): S.?stenotomum, S.?phureja, S.?goniocalyx, and S.?ajanhuiri. There are two triploid species (with 36 chromosomes): S.?chaucha and S.?juzepczukii. There is one pentaploid cultivated species (with 60 chromosomes): S.?curtilobum. There are two major subspecies of Solanum tuberosum: andigena, or Andean; and  tuberosum, or Chilean.[23] The Andean potato is adapted to the short-day conditions prevalent in the mountainous equatorial and tropical regions where it originated; the Chilean potato, however, native to the Chilo Archipelago, is adapted to the long-day conditions prevalent in the higher latitude region of southern Chile.[24] \\r\\nThe International Potato Center, based in Lima, Peru, holds an ISO-accredited collection of potato germplasm.[25] The international Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium announced in 2009 that they had achieved a draft sequence of the potato genome.[26] The potato genome contains 12 chromosomes and 860 million base pairs, making it a medium-sized plant genome.[27] More than 99 percent of all current varieties of potatoes currently grown are direct descendants of a subspecies that once grew in the lowlands of south-central Chile.[28] Nonetheless, genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species affirms that all potato subspecies derive from a single origin in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme Northwestern Bolivia (from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex).[6][7][8] The wild Crop Wild Relatives Prebreeding project encourages the use of wild relatives in breeding programs. Enriching and preserving the gene bank collection to make potatoes adaptive to diverse environmental conditions is seen as a pressing issue due to climate change.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost modern potatoes grown in North America arrived through European settlement and not independently from the South American sources, although at least one wild potato species, Solanum fendleri, naturally ranges from Peru into Texas, where it is used in breeding for resistance to a nematode species that attacks cultivated potatoes. A secondary center of genetic variability of the potato is Mexico, where important wild species that have been used extensively in modern breeding are found, such as the hexaploid Solanum demissum, as a source of resistance to the devastating late blight disease.[30] Another relative native to this region, Solanum bulbocastanum, has been used to genetically engineer the potato to resist potato blight.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes yield abundantly with little effort, and adapt readily to diverse climates as long as the climate is cool and moist enough for the plants to gather sufficient water from the soil to form the starchy tubers. Potatoes do not keep very well in storage and are vulnerable to moulds that feed on the stored tubers and quickly turn them rotten, whereas crops such as grain can be stored for several years with a low risk of rot. The yield of Calories per acre (about 9.2 million) is higher than that of maize (7.5 million), rice (7.4 million), wheat (3 million), or soybean (2.8 million).[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are close to 4,000 varieties of potato including common commercial varieties, each of which has specific agricultural or culinary attributes.[33] Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK.[34] In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups based on common characteristics, such as russet potatoes (rough brown skin), red potatoes, white potatoes, yellow potatoes (also called Yukon potatoes) and purple potatoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness: floury or mealy baking potatoes have more starch (20ÿ22%) than waxy boiling potatoes (16ÿ18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two different potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, which is a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape after being boiled in water.[35] Potatoes that are good for making potato chips or potato crisps are sometimes called \\"chipping potatoes\\", which means they meet the basic requirements of similar varietal characteristics, being firm, fairly clean, and fairly well-shaped.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Cultivated Potato Database (ECPD) is an online collaborative database of potato variety descriptions that is updated and maintained by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency within the framework of the European Cooperative Programme for Crop Genetic Resources Networks (ECP/GR)which is run by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI).[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nDozens of potato cultivars have been selectively bred specifically for their skin or, more commonly, flesh color, including gold, red, and blue varieties[38] that contain varying amounts of phytochemicals, including carotenoids for gold/yellow or polyphenols for red or blue cultivars.[39] Carotenoid compounds include provitamin A alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, which are converted to the essential nutrient, vitamin A, during digestion. Anthocyanins mainly responsible for red or blue pigmentation in potato cultivars do not have nutritional significance, but are used for visual variety and consumer appeal.[40] Recently, as of 2010, potatoes have also been bioengineered specifically for these pigmentation traits.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic research has produced several genetically modified varieties. 'New Leaf', owned by Monsanto Company, incorporates genes from Bacillus thuringiensis, which confers resistance to the Colorado potato beetle; 'New Leaf Plus' and 'New Leaf Y', approved by US regulatory agencies during the 1990s, also include resistance to viruses. McDonald's, Burger King, Frito-Lay, and Procter & Gamble announced they would not use genetically modified potatoes, and Monsanto published its intent to discontinue the line in March 2001.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nWaxy potato varieties produce two main kinds of potato starch, amylose and amylopectin, the latter of which is most industrially useful. The German chemical company BASF created the Amflora potato, which has been modified to contain antisense against the enzyme that drives synthesis of amylose, namely granule bound starch synthase.[43]  This resulting potato almost exclusively produces amylopectin, and thus is more useful for the starch industry. In 2010, the European Commission cleared the way for 'Amflora' to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes onlynot for food. Nevertheless, under EU rules, individual countries have the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory. Commercial planting of 'Amflora' was expected in the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010, and Sweden and the Netherlands in subsequent years.[44] Another GM potato variety developed by BASF is 'Fortuna' which was made resistant to late blight by adding two resistance genes, blb1 and blb2, which originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum.[45][46]  In October 2011 BASF requested cultivation and marketing approval as a feed and food from the EFSA. In 2012, GMO development in Europe was stopped by BASF.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2014, the USDA approved a genetically modified potato developed by J.R. Simplot Company, which contains genetic modifications that prevent bruising and produce less acrylamide when fried than conventional potatoes; the modifications do not cause new proteins to be made, but rather prevent proteins from being made via RNA interference.[49][50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potato was first domesticated in the region of modern-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia[6] between 8000 and 5000 BC.[7]  It has since spread around the world and become a staple crop in many countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Ancon (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC.[52][53] The  most widely cultivated variety, Solanum tuberosum tuberosum, is indigenous to the Chilo Archipelago, and has been cultivated by the local indigenous people since before the Spanish conquest.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to conservative estimates, the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900.[56] Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century, part of the Columbian exchange. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom.[8] However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora infestans, spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland as well as parts of the Scottish Highlands, resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine.[30] Thousands of varieties still persist in the Andes however, where over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley, and a dozen or more might be maintained by a single agricultural household.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, world production of potatoes was 377 million tonnes, a mere increase of 0.004% over 2015 amounts and led by China with over 26% of the world total (see table). Other major producers were India, Russia, Ukraine and the United States. However, the local importance of potato is variable and rapidly changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia.[3][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nA raw potato is 79% water, 17% carbohydrates (88% is starch), 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (see table). In an amount measuring 100 grams (3.5?oz), raw potato provides 322 kilojoules (77 kilocalories) of energy and is a rich source of vitamin B6 and vitamin C (23% and 24% of the Daily Value, respectively), with no other vitamins or minerals in significant amount (see table). The potato is rarely eaten raw because raw potato starch is poorly digested by humans.[59] When a potato is baked, its contents of vitamin B6 and vitamin C decline notably, while there is little significant change in the amount of other nutrients.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes are often broadly classified as having a high glycemic index (GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a low-GI diet. The GI of potatoes can vary considerably depending on the cultivar or cultivar category (such as \\"red\\", russet, \\"white\\", or King Edward), growing conditions and storage, preparation methods (by cooking method, whether it is eaten hot or cold, whether it is mashed or cubed or consumed whole), and accompanying foods consumed (especially the addition of various high-fat or high-protein toppings).[61] In particular, consuming reheated or cooled potatoes that were previously cooked may yield a lower GI effect.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, potatoes are not considered by the National Health Service (NHS) as counting or contributing towards the recommended daily five portions of fruit and vegetables, the 5-A-Day program.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table shows the nutrient content of potatoes next to other major staple foods, each one measured in its respective raw state, even though staple foods are not commonly eaten raw and are usually sprouted or cooked before eating. In sprouted and cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains (or other foods) may be different from the values in this table. Each nutrient (every row) has the highest number highlighted to show the staple food with the greatest amount in a 100-gram raw portion.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes contain toxic compounds known as glycoalkaloids, of which the most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine is found in other plants in the same family, Solanaceae, which includes such plants as deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana spp.), as well as the food plants eggplant and tomato. These compounds, which protect the potato plant from its predators, are generally concentrated in its leaves, flowers, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the tubers).[66] In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in the flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh. (The glycoalkaloid content was, in order from highest to lowest: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin[clarification needed], roots, berries, peel [skin plus outer cortex of tuber flesh], stems, and tuber flesh.)[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nExposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber.[12] Cooking at high temperaturesover 170?C (338?F)partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloids in wild potatoes is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloid poisoning may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and, in severe cases, coma and death. However, poisoning from cultivated potato varieties is very rare. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, giving a visual clue as to which areas of the tuber may have become more toxic. However, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent potato varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids.[67] Since then, breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar. Breeders try to keep glycoalkaloid levels below 200?mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, they can still approach solanine concentrations of 1000?mg/kg (1000 ppmw). In normal potatoes, analysis has shown solanine levels may be as little as 3.5% of the breeders' maximum, with 7ÿ187?mg/kg being found.[68] While a normal potato tuber has 12ÿ20?mg/kg of glycoalkaloid content, a green potato tuber contains 250ÿ280?mg/kg and its skin has 1500ÿ2200?mg/kg.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes are generally grown from seed potatoes, tubers specifically grown to be free from disease and to provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, the areas where seed potatoes are grown are selected with care. In the US, this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of all 50 states where potatoes are grown.[70] These locations are selected for their cold, hard winters that kill pests and summers with long sunshine hours for optimum growth. In the UK, most seed potatoes originate in Scotland, in areas where westerly winds prevent aphid attack and thus prevent spread of potato virus pathogens.[71][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato growth is divided into five phases. During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second, photosynthesis begins as the plant develops leaves and branches. In the third phase, stolons develop from lower leaf axils on the stem and grow downwards into the ground and on these stolons new tubers develop as swellings of the stolon. This phase is often, but not always, associated with flowering. Tuber formation halts when soil temperatures reach 27?C (81?F); hence potatoes are considered a cool-season, or winter, crop.[72] Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical to a good yield: optimal soil moisture and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to pest attacks. The fifth and final phase is the maturation of the tubers: the plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and the sugars in the tubers convert to starches.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew tubers may start growing at the surface of the soil. Since exposure to light leads to an undesirable greening of the skins and the development of solanine as a protection from the sun's rays, growers cover surface tubers. Commercial growers cover them by piling additional soil around the base of the plant as it grows (called \\"hilling\\" up, or in British English \\"earthing up\\"). An alternative method, used by home gardeners and smaller-scale growers, involves covering the growing area with organic mulches such as straw or plastic sheets.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrect potato husbandry can be an arduous task in some circumstances. Good ground preparation, harrowing, plowing, and rolling are always needed, along with a little grace from the weather and a good source of water.[74] Three successive plowings, with associated harrowing and rolling, are desirable before planting. Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are rogued in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes are sensitive to heavy frosts, which damage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historically significant Phytophthora infestans (late blight) remains an ongoing problem in Europe[30][75] and the United States.[76] Other potato diseases include Rhizoctonia, Sclerotinia, black leg, powdery mildew, powdery scab and leafroll virus.\\r\\nInsects that commonly transmit potato diseases or damage the plants include the Colorado potato beetle, the potato tuber moth, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), the potato aphid, beet leafhoppers, thrips, and mites. The potato cyst nematode is a microscopic worm that thrives on the roots, thus causing the potato plants to wilt. Since its eggs can survive in the soil for several years, crop rotation is recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the crop year 2008, many of the certified organic potatoes produced in the United Kingdom and certified by the Soil Association as organic were sprayed with a copper pesticide[77] to control potato blight (Phytophthora infestans).[78] According to the Soil Association, the total copper that can be applied to organic land is 6?kg/ha/year.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to an Environmental Working Group analysis of USDA and FDA pesticide residue tests performed from 2000 through 2008, 84% of the 2,216 tested potato samples contained detectable traces of at least one pesticide. A total of 36 unique pesticides were detected on potatoes over the 2,216 samples, though no individual sample contained more than 6 unique pesticide traces, and the average was 1.29 detectable unique pesticide traces per sample. The average quantity of all pesticide traces found in the 2,216 samples was 1.602 ppm. While this was a very low value of pesticide residue, it was the highest amongst the 50 vegetables analyzed.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong \\"grape\\" (or graip), i.e., a spading fork, or a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90 angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large potato harvesters, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmature potatoes may be sold as \\"creamer potatoes\\" and are particularly valued for taste. These are often harvested by the home gardener or farmer by \\"grabbling\\", i.e. pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the plant in place. A creamer potato is a variety of potato harvested before it matures to keep it small and tender. It is generally either a Yukon Gold potato or a red potato, called gold creamers[81] or red creamers respectively, and measures approximately 1 inch (2.5?cm) in diameter.[82] The skin of creamer potatoes is waxy and high in moisture content, and the flesh contains a lower level of starch than other potatoes. Like potatoes in general, they can be prepared by boiling, baking, frying, and roasting.[82] Slightly older than creamer potatoes are \\"new potatoes\\", which are also prized for their taste and texture and often come from the same varieties.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures 50 to 60?F (10 to 16?C) with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nStorage facilities need to be carefully designed to keep the potatoes alive and slow the natural process of decomposition, which involves the breakdown of starch. It is crucial that the storage area is dark, ventilated well and, for long-term storage, maintained at temperatures near 4?C (39?F). For short-term storage, temperatures of about 7 to 10?C (45 to 50?F) are preferred.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, temperatures below 4?C (39?F) convert the starch in potatoes into sugar, which alters their taste and cooking qualities and leads to higher acrylamide levels in the cooked product, especially in deep-fried dishes. The discovery of acrylamides in starchy foods in 2002 has led to international health concerns. They are believed to be probable carcinogens and their occurrence in cooked foods is being studied for potentially influencing health problems.[a][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder optimum conditions in commercial warehouses, potatoes can be stored for up to 10ÿ12 months.[85] The commercial storage and retrieval of potatoes involves several phases: first drying surface moisture; wound healing at 85% to 95% relative humidity and temperatures below 25?C (77?F); a staged cooling phase; a holding phase; and a reconditioning phase, during which the tubers are slowly warmed. Mechanical ventilation is used at various points during the process to prevent condensation and the accumulation of carbon dioxide.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen stored in homes unrefrigerated, the shelf life is usually a few weeks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf potatoes develop green areas or start to sprout, trimming or peeling those green-colored parts is inadequate to remove copresent toxins, and such potatoes are no longer edible.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world dedicated 18.6?million?ha (46?million acres) in 2010 for potato cultivation. The average world farm yield for potato was 17.4 tonnes per hectare, in 2010. Potato farms in the United States were the most productive in 2010, with a nationwide average of 44.3 tonnes per hectare.[89] United Kingdom was a close second.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand farmers have demonstrated some of the best commercial yields in the world, ranging between 60 and 80 tonnes per hectare, some reporting yields of 88 tonnes potatoes per hectare.[90][91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a big gap among various countries between high and low yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between 38ÿ44 tonnes per hectare. China and India accounted for over a third of world's production in 2010, and had yields of 14.7 and 19.9 tonnes per hectare respectively.[89] The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes of potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed, seed age and quality, crop management practices and the plant environment. Improvements in one or more of these yield determinants, and a closure of the yield gap, can be a major boost to food supply and farmer incomes in the developing world.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes are prepared in many ways: skin-on or peeled, whole or cut up, with seasonings or without. The only requirement involves cooking to swell the starch granules. Most potato dishes are served hot but some are first cooked, then served cold, notably potato salad and potato chips (crisps). Common dishes are: mashed potatoes, which are first boiled (usually peeled), and then mashed with milk or yogurt and butter; whole baked potatoes; boiled or steamed potatoes; French-fried potatoes or chips; cut into cubes and roasted; scalloped, diced, or sliced and fried (home fries); grated into small thin strips and fried (hash browns); grated and formed into dumplings, R?sti or potato pancakes. Unlike many foods, potatoes can also be easily cooked in a microwave oven and still retain nearly all of their nutritional value, provided they are covered in ventilated plastic wrap to prevent moisture from escaping; this method produces a meal very similar to a steamed potato, while retaining the appearance of a conventionally baked potato. Potato chunks also commonly appear as a stew ingredient. Potatoes are boiled between 10 and 25[95] minutes, depending on size and type, to become soft.\\r\\n\\r\\nPotatoes are also used for purposes other than eating by humans, for example:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeruvian cuisine naturally contains the potato as a primary ingredient in many dishes, as around 3,000 varieties of this tuber are grown there.[106]\\r\\nSome of the more notable dishes include boiled potato as a base for several dishes or with aj-based sauces like in Papa a la Huancana or ocopa, diced potato for its use in soups like in cau cau, or in Carapulca with dried potato (papa seca). Smashed condimented potato is used in causa Lime?a and papa rellena. French-fried potatoes are a typical ingredient in Peruvian stir-fries, including the classic dish lomo saltado.\\r\\n\\r\\nChu?o is a freeze-dried potato product traditionally made by Quechua and Aymara communities of Peru and Bolivia,[107]  and is known in various countries of South America, including Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. In Chile's Chilo Archipelago, potatoes are the main ingredient of many dishes, including milcaos, chapaleles, curanto and chochoca. In Ecuador, the potato, as well as being a staple with most dishes, is featured in the hearty locro de papas, a thick soup of potato, squash, and cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, potatoes form part of the traditional staple fish and chips. Roast potatoes are commonly served with a Sunday roast, and mashed potatoes form a major component of several other traditional dishes such as shepherd's pie, bubble and squeak, and bangers and mash. New potatoes may be cooked with mint and often served with butter.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tattie scone is a popular Scottish dish containing potatoes. Colcannon is a traditional Irish food made with mashed potato, shredded kale or cabbage, and onion; champ is a similar dish. Boxty pancakes are eaten throughout Ireland, although associated especially with the North, and in Irish diaspora communities; they are traditionally made with grated potatoes, soaked to loosen the starch and mixed with flour, buttermilk and baking powder. A variant eaten and sold in Lancashire, especially Liverpool, is made with cooked and mashed potatoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBryndzov halu?ky is the Slovakian national dish, made of a batter of flour and finely grated potatoes that is boiled to form dumplings. These are then mixed with regionally varying ingredients.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Germany, Northern and Eastern Europe (especially in Scandinavian countries), Finland, Poland, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, newly harvested, early ripening varieties are considered a special delicacy. Boiled whole and served un-peeled with dill, these \\"new potatoes\\" are traditionally consumed with Baltic herring. Puddings made from grated potatoes (kugel, kugelis, and potato babka) are popular items of Ashkenazi, Lithuanian, and Belarusian cuisine.[109] German fries and various version of Potato salad are part of German cuisine. Bauernfrhstck (literally farmer's breakfast) is a warm German dish made from fried potatoes, eggs, ham and vegetables.\\r\\n\\r\\nCepelinai is Lithuanian national dish. They are a type of dumpling made from riced potatoes (see Potato ricer) and usually stuffed with minced meat, although sometimes dry cottage cheese (curd) or mushrooms are used instead.[110]\\r\\nIn Western Europe, especially in Belgium, sliced potatoes are fried to create frieten, the original French fried potatoes. Stamppot, a traditional Dutch meal, is based on mashed potatoes mixed with vegetables.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France, the most notable potato dish is the Hachis Parmentier, named after Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, a French pharmacist, nutritionist, and agronomist who, in the late 18th century, was instrumental in the acceptance of the potato as an edible crop in the country. The pat aux pommes de terre is a regional potato dish from the central Allier and Limousin regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the north of Italy, in particular, in the Friuli region of the northeast, potatoes serve to make a type of pasta called gnocchi.[111] Similarly, cooked and mashed potatoes or potato flour can be used in the Kn?del or dumpling eaten with or added to meat dishes all over central and Eastern Europe, but especially in Bavaria and Luxembourg. Potatoes form one of the main ingredients in many soups such as the vichyssoise and Albanian potato and cabbage soup. In western Norway, komle is popular.\\r\\n\\r\\nA traditional Canary Islands dish is Canarian wrinkly potatoes or papas arrugadas. Tortilla de patatas (potato omelette) and patatas bravas (a dish of fried potatoes in a spicy tomato sauce) are near-universal constituent of Spanish tapas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, potatoes have become one of the most widely consumed crops and thus have a variety of preparation methods and condiments. French fries and often hash browns are commonly found in typical American fast-food burger \\"joints\\" and cafeterias. One popular favourite involves a baked potato with cheddar cheese (or sour cream and chives) on top, and in New England \\"smashed potatoes\\" (a chunkier variation on mashed potatoes, retaining the peel) have great popularity. Potato flakes are popular as an instant variety of mashed potatoes, which reconstitute into mashed potatoes by adding water, with butter or oil and salt to taste. A regional dish of Central New York, salt potatoes are bite-size new potatoes boiled in water saturated with salt then served with melted butter. At more formal dinners, a common practice includes taking small red potatoes, slicing them, and roasting them in an iron skillet. Among American Jews, the practice of eating latkes (fried potato pancakes) is common during the festival of Hanukkah.\\r\\n\\r\\nA traditional Acadian dish from New Brunswick is known as poutine rape. The Acadian poutine is a ball of grated and mashed potato, salted, sometimes filled with pork in the centre, and boiled. The result is a moist ball about the size of a baseball. It is commonly eaten with salt and pepper or brown sugar. It is believed to have originated from the German Kl??e, prepared by early German settlers who lived among the Acadians. Poutine, by contrast, is a hearty serving of French fries, fresh cheese curds and hot gravy. Tracing its origins to Quebec in the 1950s, it has become a widespread and popular dish throughout Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nPotato grading for Idaho potatoes is performed in which No. 1 potatoes are the highest quality and No. 2 are rated as lower in quality due to their appearance (e.g. blemishes or bruises, pointy ends).[112] Potato density assessment can be performed by floating them in brines.[113] High-density potatoes are desirable in the production of dehydrated mashed potatoes, potato crisps and french fries.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South Asia, the potato is a very popular traditional staple. In India, the most popular potato dishes are aloo ki sabzi, batata vada, and samosa, which is spicy mashed potato mixed with a small amount of vegetable stuffed in conical dough, and deep fried. Potatoes are also a major ingredient as fast food items, such as aloo chaat, where they are deep fried and served with chutney. In Northern India, alu dum and alu paratha are a favourite part of the diet; the first is a spicy curry of boiled potato, the second is a type of stuffed chapati.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dish called masala dosa from South India is very notable all over India. It is a thin pancake of rice and pulse paste rolled over spicy smashed potato and eaten with sambhar and chutney. Poori in south India in particular in Tamil Nadu is almost always taken with smashed potato masal. Other favourite dishes are alu tikki and pakoda items.\\r\\n\\r\\nVada pav is a popular vegetarian fast food dish in Mumbai and other regions in the Maharashtra in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nAloo posto (a curry with potatoes and poppy seeds) is immensely popular in East India, especially Bengal. Although potatoes are not native to India, it has become a vital part of food all over the country especially North Indian food preparations. In Tamil Nadu this tuber acquired a name based on its appearance 'urulai-k-kizhangu' (??????? ???????) meaning cylindrical tuber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aloo gosht, Potato and meat curry, is one of the popular dishes in South Asia, especially in Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn East Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, rice is by far the predominant starch crop, with potatoes a secondary crop, especially in China and Japan. However, it is used in northern China where rice is not easily grown, with a popular dish being C (qؐng jio tѸ du sؐ), made with green pepper, vinegar and thin slices of potato. In the winter, roadside sellers in northern China will also sell roasted potatoes. It is also occasionally seen in Korean and Thai cuisines.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 19th century, numerous images of potato harvesting appeared in European art, including the works of Willem Witsen and Anton Mauve.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Gogh's 1885 painting The Potato Eaters portrays a family eating potatoes. Van Gogh said he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He deliberately chose coarse and ugly models, thinking that they would be natural and unspoiled in his finished work.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nJean-Fran?ois Millet's The Potato Harvest depicts peasants working in the plains between Barbizon and Chailly. It presents a theme representative of the peasants' struggle for survival.  Millet's technique for this work incorporated paste-like pigments thickly applied over a coarsely textured canvas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potato has been an essential crop in the Andes since the pre-Columbian Era. The Moche culture from Northern Peru made ceramics from earth, water, and fire. This pottery was a sacred substance, formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes. Potatoes are represented anthropomorphically as well as naturally.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nInvented in 1949 and marketed and sold commercially by Hasbro in 1952, Mr. Potato Head is an American toy that consists of a plastic potato and attachable plastic parts such as ears and eyes to make a face.

Most recently, the 2015 Cricket World Cup, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand, was won by Australia, who beat their co-hosts New Zealand. The current trophy was instituted in 1999. It always remains with the ICC, and a replica is awarded to the winning team.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nNations with Test status automatically qualify for the World Cup, while associate and affiliate ICC members must qualify through a qualification tournament, the World Cup Qualifier. Though an associate member is yet to reach the final, Kenya did reach the semi-finals in 2003.[5] Australia is the most successful team in the competition's history, winning five tournaments and finishing as runner-up twice.[6] Twice, teams have won successive tournaments: the West Indies won the first two editions (1975 and 1979) and Australia won three in a row (1999, 2003 and 2007). Australia has played in the most finals (seven out of eleven: 1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015). England is the team to reach the final and not win the World Cup most often, ending as runner-up in all three final appearances.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the twenty teams that have qualified for at least one Cricket World Cup, seven have contested a tournament final.[9] Seven venues have hosted the final; only two of those ÿ Lord's, in London, and the Melbourne Cricket Ground ÿ have hosted multiple finals.[10] India is the only country that has hosted a World Cup final at more than one venue, with Eden Gardens, Kolkata, hosting in 1987 and Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium hosting in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inaugural ICC Cricket World Cup final was held on 21 June 1975 at Lord's, contested by Australia and the West Indies.  A man of the match performance,[11] including a century from West Indian captain Clive Lloyd coming in to bat at number five with his team 50/3,[12] formed the basis of a 149-run fourth-wicket partnership with Rohan Kanhai.[13] Keith Boyce added a quick 34 and the Australians were set a target of 292 to win in a 60-over encounter.  In reply, Alan Turner hit 40 from 54 deliveries and Australian captain Ian Chappell scored 62 from 93 balls.  Australia \\"contributed to their own destruction\\" in an innings with five run outs, and the West Indies were crowned the first cricket world champions, winning by 17 runs.[14]  Four years later, the West Indies qualified for the final, this time facing England, hosted at Lord's for the second consecutive tournament. An unbeaten 138 from Viv Richards, and support from Collis King in a 139-run partnership for the fifth wicket,[15] saw the West Indies set England a target of 287 runs to win in 60 overs.[16]  A profitable yet slow opening partnership between Mike Brearley and Geoffrey Boycott (the latter taking 17 overs to reach double figures)[17] saw England to 129.  However, following Brearley's dismissal, only Graham Gooch and Derek Randall made a \\"brief assault\\" on the West Indian bowling,[17] before a batting collapse, Joel Garner taking five wickets in eleven balls.[18] England ended 194 all out, and presented the West Indies with their second consecutive title, winning by 92 runs.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nLord's re-hosted the third World Cup final in June 1983, and was West Indies' third consecutive final. On this occasion, they faced India in front of 24,609 spectators.[19] Sunil Gavaskar was dismissed early in the innings for two runs, and only Kris Srikkanth scored more than thirty;[20] Andy Roberts took three wickets for the West Indies leaving India all out for 183.[20]  Following the dismissals of Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes and Larry Gomes by  Madan Lal for six runs between them, the West Indies collapsed to 140 all out, handing the title to India by 43 runs.[19]  India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 tournament; the final was held at Eden Gardens in Kolkata between Australia and England, both appearing for the second time and vying for their first title. Australia won the toss and elected to bat first; David Boon scored 75 runs from 125 deliveries, while Mike Veletta made a rapid 45 from 31 deliveries taking Australia to a total of 253/5 by the close of play, this time after 50 overs.[21]  In front of around 70,000 spectators, England's middle order of Bill Athey, Mike Gatting and Allan Lamb provided some resistance, but with 17 runs required in the final over to win, England fell short and lost by 7 runs.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1992 tournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, with the first ever day/night final being held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia between England and Pakistan.  In their first final appearance, Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat first.  Despite two early wickets from Derek Pringle, Pakistani batsmen Imran Khan and Javed Miandad shared a third-wicket partnership of 139.  Both Inzamam-ul-Haq and Wasim Akram added over thirty runs each at more than a run-a-ball, leading Pakistan to a total of 249/6 in 50 overs.[23] A crowd of over 87,000 saw man-of-the-match Wasim Akram take three of England's wickets, including that of all-rounder Ian Botham for a duck, after Graeme Hick was \\"baffled by the googly\\".[24] England were bowled out for 227, and Pakistan won by 22 runs.[23]  India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka hosted the tournament in 1996. Sri Lanka was making their first appearance in the final, and faced 1987 champions Australia in another day/night contest.  After winning the toss, Arjuna Ranatunga sent Australia in to bat at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Captain Mark Taylor and Ricky Ponting added 101 in their second-wicket partnership as Australia completed their 50 overs 241/7.[25]  Man of the match Aravinda de Silva's century, assisted by partnerships with Asanka Gurusinha and Ranatunga led Sri Lanka to the total with 22 balls and 7 wickets to spare, and their first win in the final. This was the first time a host won the title, though the final was played in Pakistan. It was also the first time that the team batting second emerged victorious.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia's \\"12-year era of World Cup dominance\\" began with the 1999 tournament,[26] hosted for the fourth time by England. In a \\"one-sided\\" final,[27] Shane Warne's four wickets helped to restrict Pakistan to 132 runs, all out with 11 overs yet to bat.[28]  A rapid fifty from Adam Gilchrist, and support from Mark Waugh, Ponting and Darren Lehmann, saw Australia reach the total in just over 20 overs, winning by eight wickets.[28]  The 2003 tournament had three co-hosts: South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe, the final being a day/night match contested between Australia and India at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg.  Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden opened the batting, making a century partnership before Ponting and Damien Martin went on to score the highest partnership in any World Cup final with an unbeaten 234.[29]  Australia batted out their fifty overs, and ended on the highest score in World Cup final history: 359/2.[30]  Player of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar was dismissed in the first over of India's reply but Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid combined to score 88 in their fourth wicket partnership.  However, following Dravid's dismissal, India's batting collapsed, and they finished on 234 all out with nearly eleven overs remaining, handing Australia a 125-run victory.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2007 final, held at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, was reduced to 38 overs a side following a two-hour rain delay.[31]  Australia's Gilchrist hit the fastest century in a World Cup final at a strike rate of over 143 and his opening stand with Hayden became the largest first-wicket partnership in World Cup history.[29] Australia ended on 281/4, an average of 7.39 runs per over.[32]  In reply, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara accumulated 116 runs for the second wicket, but with Chamara Silva the only other batsman to score over 20, Sri Lanka capitulated.  Despite a revised target, due to a further rain break, calculated using the DuckworthÿLewis method, Sri Lanka scored 215ÿ8 from their allotted overs. With a 53-run victory, Australia won their third consecutive World Cup.[32]  Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka co-hosted the 2011 tournament,[33] with the latter pair meeting in the final in the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.  Scoring 91 runs in their final 10 overs,[34] Sri Lanka's innings ended on 274/6, Mahela Jayawardene top-scoring with an unbeaten 103.[35]  Sehwag was out leg before wicket to Lasith Malinga in the second ball of the Indian innings, Tendulkar soon followed him, but 97 from Gautam Gambhir and an unbeaten 91 from MS Dhoni saw India home with 10 balls to spare. By winning the match, India became the first team to win the finals on home soil.[35]","input":"Who was the first cricket world cup winner?"},{"output":"\\"bounce mat\\"","context":"A trampoline is a device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched between a steel frame using many coiled springs. People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes.\\r\\nThe fabric that users bounce on (commonly known as the \\"bounce mat\\" or \\"trampoline bed\\") is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA game similar to trampolining was developed by the Inuit, who would toss blanket dancers into the air on a walrus skin one at a time (see Nalukataq) during a spring celebration of whale harvest. There is also some evidence of people in Europe having been tossed into the air by a number of people holding a blanket. Mak in the Wakefield Second Shepherds' Play and Sancho Panza in Don Quixote are both subjected to blanketing ÿ however, these are clearly non-voluntary, non-recreational instances of quasi-judicial, mob-administered punishment. The trampoline-like life nets once used by firefighters to catch people jumping out of burning buildings were invented in 1887.\\r\\nThe 19th-century poster for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal refers to performance on trampoline. The device is thought to have been more like a springboard than the fabric-and-coiled-springs apparatus presently in use.[1]\\r\\nThese may not be the true antecedents of the modern sport of trampolining, but indicate that the concept of bouncing off a fabric surface has been around for some time. In the early years of the 20th century, some acrobats used a \\"bouncing bed\\" on the stage to amuse audiences. The bouncing bed was, a form of small trampoline covered by bedclothes, on which acrobats performed mostly comedy routines.\\r\\nAccording to circus folklore, the trampoline was supposedly first developed by an artiste named du Trampolin, who saw the possibility of using the trapeze safety net as a form of propulsion and landing device and experimented with different systems of suspension, eventually reducing the net to a practical size for separate performance. While trampoline-like devices were used for shows and in the circus, the story of du Trampolin is almost certainly apocryphal. No documentary evidence has been found to support it.\\r\\nThe first modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold in 1936.[2] Nissen was a gymnastics and diving competitor and Griswold was a tumbler on the gymnastics team, both at the University of Iowa, United States. They had observed trapeze artists using a tight net to add entertainment value to their performance and experimented by stretching a piece of canvas, in which they had inserted grommets along each side, to an angle iron frame by means of coiled springs. It was initially used to train tumblers but soon became popular in its own right. Nissen explained that the name came from the Spanish trampoln, meaning a diving board. Nissen had heard the word on a demonstration tour in Mexico in the late 1930s and decided to use an anglicized form as the trademark for the apparatus.[3]\\r\\nIn 1942, Griswold and Nissen created the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline & Tumbling Company, and began making trampolines commercially in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\\r\\nThe generic term for the trademarked trampoline was a rebound tumbler[4] and the sport began as rebound tumbling. It has since lost its trademark and has become a generic trademark.\\r\\nEarly in their development Nissen anticipated trampolines being used in a number of recreational areas, including those involving more than one participant on the same trampoline. One such game was Spaceballa game of two teams of two on a single trampoline with specially constructed end \\"walls\\" and a middle \\"wall\\" through which a ball could be propelled to hit a target on the other side's end wall.[5]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators, giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before.[6] After the war, the development of the space flight programme again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet astronauts, giving them experience of variable body positions in flight.\\r\\nThe first Trampoline World Championships were organised by Ted Blake of Nissen, and held in London in 1964. The first World Champions were both American, Dan Millman and Judy Wills Cline. Cline went on to dominate and become the most highly decorated trampoline champion of all time.\\r\\nOne of the earliest pioneers of trampoline as a competitive sport was Jeff Hennessy, a coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Hennessy also coached the United States trampoline team, producing more world champions than any other person. Among his world champions was his daughter, Leigh Hennessy. Both Jeff and Leigh Hennessy are in the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThe competitive gymnastic sport of trampolining has been part of the Olympic Games since 2000. On a modern competitive trampoline, a skilled athlete can bounce to a height of up to 10 metres (33?ft), performing multiple somersaults and twists. Trampolines also feature in the competitive sport of Slamball, a variant of basketball, and Bossaball, a variant of volleyball.\\r\\nThere are a number of other sports that use trampolines to help develop and hone acrobatic skills in training before they are used in the actual sporting venue. Examples can be found in diving, gymnastics, and freestyle skiing. One main advantage of trampolining as a training tool for other acrobatic sports is that it allows repetitive drill practice for acrobatic experience every two seconds or less, compared with many minutes with sports that involve hills, ramps or high platforms. In some situations it can also be safer compared to landings on the ground.\\r\\nThere are two generic types of trampoline, competitive and recreational.\\r\\nThe frame of a competitive trampoline is made of steel and can be made to fold up for transportation to competition venues. The trampoline bed is rectangular 4.28 by 2.14 metres (14?ft 1?in G?7?ft 0?in) in size fitted into the 5.05 by 2.91 metres (17?ft G?10?ft) frame [7] with around 110 steel springs (the actual number may vary by manufacturer). The bed is made of a strong fabric, although this is not itself elastic; the elasticity is provided only by the springs. The fabric can be woven from webbing, which is the most commonly used material. However, in the 2007 World Championships held in Quebec City, a Ross bed (or two-string bed), woven from individual thin strings, was used. This type of bed gives a little extra height to the rebound.\\r\\nRecreational trampolines for home use are less sturdily constructed than competitive ones and their springs are weaker. They may be of various shapes, though most are circular, octagonal or rectangular. The fabric is usually a waterproof canvas or woven polypropylene material.\\r\\nAs with competitive trampolines, recreational trampolines are usually made using coiled steel springs to provide the rebounding force, but spring-free trampolines also exist.\\r\\nIn 1959 and 1960 it became very popular to have outdoor commercial \\"jump centres\\" or \\"trampoline parks\\" in many places in North America where people could enjoy recreational trampolining. However, these tended to have a high accident rate, and the public's interest rapidly waned.[8]\\r\\nIn the early 21st century, indoor commercial trampoline parks have made a comeback, with a number of franchises operating across the United States and Canada. ABC News has reported that in 2014 there were at least 345 trampoline parks operating in the United States.[9] Similar parks have more recently been opened in other countries.[10] The International Association of Trampoline Parks (IATP) estimated that park numbers had grown from 35-40 parks in 2011 to around 280 in 2014. The following year, IATP estimated that 345 parks were open by the end of 2014, and that another 115 would open by the end of 2015 in North America. IATP also estimated that at the end of 2014 there were 40 parks outside of North America, and that by the end of 2015 there would be at least 100 indoor trampoline parks open internationally.[11][12] More notable companies include CircusTrix and Sky Zone.\\r\\nThese commercial parks are located indoors, and have wall-to wall-trampolines to prevent people falling off the trampolines on to hard surfaces. Padded or spring walls protect people from impact injuries. Despite these precautions, there has been at least one death recorded due to a head-first landing at a trampoline park.[13] In March 2012, New York Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain seriously injured his ankle while jumping at a commercial jump centre in Tampa with his son.[14] In 2018, a man died in a British Columbia trampoline park, which prompted calls for more safety regulations for these popular activities.[15]\\r\\nWall running is a sport where the participant uses a wall and platforms placed next to the trampoline bed to do tricks. The basic movement is a backdrop on the trampoline and then the feet touching the wall at the top of the bounce. From there, there is no limit to the acrobatic movements that are possible, similar to regular trampolining. The advantage is that twists and turns can be initiated more forcefully from a solid wall and that the vertical speed can be transferred to rotation in addition to forces from the legs or arms. Additionally, energy can be gained both from the bed at the bottom of the bounce, and from the wall at the top of the bounce.\\r\\nUsing a trampoline can be dangerous. Organized clubs and gyms usually have large safety end-decks with foam pads at each end, and spotters are placed alongside the trampoline to try to break the fall of any athlete who loses control and falls. In 1999, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated there were 100,000 hospital emergency room visits for trampoline injuries.[16]\\r\\nDue to the much larger numbers involved and lesser safety standards, the majority of injuries occur on privately owned home trampolines or in commercial trampoline facilities rather than organized gyms.[17] Bouncing off a trampoline can result in a fall of 3ÿ4 metres (10ÿ13?ft) from the peak of a bounce to the ground or a fall into the suspension springs and frame. There has been an increase in the number of home trampolines in recent years and a corresponding increase in the number of injuries reported. Some medical organizations have suggested that the devices be banned from home use.[18][19]\\r\\nAuthorities recommend that only one person should be allowed to jump at a time to avoid collisions and people being catapulted in an unexpected direction or higher than they expect. One of the most common sources of injury is when multiple users are bouncing on the trampoline at one time. More often than not, this situation leads to users bouncing into one another and thus becoming injured; many suffer broken bones as a result of landing badly after knocking into another user.[19]\\r\\nAnother of the most common sources of serious injury is an attempt to perform somersaults without proper training. In some cases, people land on their neck or head, which can cause paralysis or even death.[19] In an infamous incident in the 1960s, pole-vaulting champion Brian Sternberg became paralyzed from the neck down in a trampoline accident.\\r\\nDanger can be reduced by burying the trampoline so the bed is closer to the surrounding surface to lessen falling distance, and padding that surrounding area. Pads over the spring and frame reduce the severity of impact injuries. Keeping the springs covered also reduces the risk of a limb falling between the gaps in the springs and the rest of the body falling off the trampoline.\\r\\nKits are available for home trampolines that provide a retaining net around the trampoline and prevent users from bouncing over the edge. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that there is no epidemiological evidence that these improve safety.[19] The nets do prevent jumpers falling off the trampoline onto the ground, but these falls are not the most common source of injury. Multiple users bouncing in a netted trampoline can still be injured. Safety net enclosures have a larger benefit for safeguarding solo trampolinists, so long as they avoid falling on their head or neck.\\r\\nHaving some training in a gym may be beneficial in alerting people to possible hazards and provide techniques to avoid bad falls.[20]\\r\\nFamily-oriented commercial areas in North America, such as shopping centres, carnivals, and so on, often include closed inflatable trampolines (CITs) as a children's attraction. These have safety nets on the sides to prevent injuries.\\r\\nA mini-trampoline (also known as a rebounder, trampette, jogging trampoline, or exercise trampoline) is a type of trampoline less than 1 metre (3?ft 3?in) in diameter and about 30 centimetres (12?in) off the ground, often kept indoors and used as part of a physical fitness regime. So-called rebounding provides a form of exercise with a low impact on knees and joints. Mini-trampolines do not give a rebound as high as larger recreational or competitive trampolines.\\r\\nIn co-operation with the University of Bremen and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the machtWissen.de Corporation from Bremen, Germany developed the weightlessness demonstrator \\"Gravity Jumper\\" based on a trampoline. Due to the acceleration during the jump, an acceleration force takes effect in addition to the usual gravitational force. Both forces add up and the person on the trampoline seems to become heavier. As soon as the jumper leaves the trampoline, he is under a free fall condition, which means that the jumper seems weightless and does not feel the acceleration due to gravity. Every person receives a three-axis acceleration sensor, fastened to them with a belt. The sensor transmits the data of the flight path to a monitor; a monitor shows the course of the acceleration, including the weightless phase. The interplay of acceleration due to the trampoline and weightlessness becomes apparent.","input":"What is the center of a trampoline called?"},{"output":"New Amsterdam","context":"New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam, pronounced [?ni?mst?r?dm] or [?niu??ms-]) was a 17th-century Dutch settlement established at the southern tip of Manhattan Island that served as the seat of the colonial government in New Netherland. The factorij became a settlement outside Fort Amsterdam. The fort was situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan and was meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province in 1625.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1655, the population of New Netherland had grown to 2,000 people, with 1,500 living in New Amsterdam. Prior to 1664, the population had exploded in nine years to almost 9,000 people in New Netherland, 2,500 of whom lived in New Amsterdam, 1,000 lived near Fort Orange, and the remainder in other towns and villages.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Amsterdam was renamed New York on September 8, 1664, in honor of the Duke of York (later James II of England), in whose name the English had captured it. After the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665ÿ1667, England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands agreed to the status quo in the Treaty of Breda. The English kept the island of Manhattan, the Dutch giving up their claim to the town and the rest of the colony, while the English formally abandoned Surinam in South America, and the island of Run in the East Indies to the Dutch, confirming their control of the valuable Spice Islands. Today much of what was once New Amsterdam is New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1524, nearly a century before the arrival of the Dutch, the site that later became New Amsterdam was named New Angoulme by the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, to commemorate his patron King Francis I of France, former Count of Angoulme.[3] The first recorded exploration by the Dutch of the area around what is now called New York Bay was in 1609 with the voyage of the ship Halve Maen (English: \\"Half Moon\\"), captained by Henry Hudson[4] in the service of the Dutch Republic, as the emissary of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, Holland's stadholder. Hudson named the river the Mauritius River. He was covertly attempting to find the Northwest Passage for the Dutch East India Company. Instead, he brought back news about the possibility of exploitation of beaver by the Dutch who sent commercial, private missions to the area the following years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, beaver pelts were highly prized in Europe, because the fur could be felted to make waterproof hats. A by-product of the trade in beaver pelts was castoreumthe secretion of the animals' anal glandswhich was used for its medicinal properties and for perfumes. The expeditions by Adriaen Block and Hendrick Christiaensen in 1611, 1612, 1613 and 1614, resulted in the surveying and charting of the region from the 38th parallel to the 45th parallel.[5] On their 1614 map, which gave them a four-year trade monopoly under a patent of the States General, they named the newly discovered and mapped territory New Netherland for the first time. It also showed the first year-round trading presence in New Netherland, Fort Nassau, which would be replaced in 1624 by Fort Orange, which eventually grew into the town of Beverwyck, now Albany.\\r\\n\\r\\nDominican trader Juan Rodriguez (rendered in Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, arrived on Manhattan Island during the winter of 1613ÿ1614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. He was the first recorded non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory of New Netherland was originally a private, profit-making commercial enterprise focused on cementing alliances and conducting trade with the diverse Indian tribes. Surveying and exploration of the region was conducted as a prelude to an anticipated official settlement by the Dutch Republic, which occurred in 1624.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1620 the Pilgrims attempted to sail to the Hudson River from England. However, the Mayflower reached Cape Cod (now part of Massachusetts) on November 9, 1620, after a voyage of 64 days.[8] For a variety of reasons, primarily a shortage of supplies, the Mayflower could not proceed to the Hudson River, and the colonists decided to settle near Cape Cod, establishing the Plymouth Colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mouth of the Hudson River was selected as the ideal place for initial settlement as it had easy access to the ocean while also securing an ice-free lifeline to the beaver trading post near present-day Albany. Here, Indian hunters supplied them with pelts in exchange for European-made trade goods and wampum, which was soon being made by the Dutch on Long Island. In 1621, the Dutch West India Company was founded. Between 1621 and 1623, orders were given to the private, commercial traders to vacate the territory, thus opening up the territory to Dutch settlers and company traders. It also allowed the laws and ordinances of the states of Holland to apply. Previously, during the private, commercial period, only the law of the ship had applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1624, the first settlers in New Netherland arrived on Noten Eylandt (Nut or Nutten Island, now Governors Island) aboard the ship New Netherland under the command of Cornelius Jacobsen May, who disembarked on the island with thirty families in order to take legal possession of the New Netherland territory.[9] The families were then dispersed to Fort Wilhelmus on Verhulsten Island (Burlington Island) in the South River (now the Delaware River), to Kievitshoek (now Old Saybrook, Connecticut) at the mouth of the Verse River (now the Connecticut River) and further north at Fort Nassau on the Mauritius or North River (now the Hudson River), near what is now Albany.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fort and sawmill were soon erected at Nut Island. The latter was constructed by Franchoys Fezard and was taken apart for iron in 1648.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threat of attack from other European colonial powers prompted the directors of the Dutch West India Company to formulate a plan to protect the entrance to the Hudson River. In 1624, 30 families were sponsord by Dutch West India Company moving from Nut Island to Manhattan Island, where a citadel to contain Fort Amsterdam was being laid out by Cryn Frederickz van Lobbrecht at the direction of Willem Verhulst. By the end of 1625, the site had been staked out directly south of Bowling Green on the site of the present U.S. Custom House. The Mohawk-Mahican War in the Hudson Valley led the company to relocate even more settlers to the vicinity of the new Fort Amsterdam. In the end, colonizing was a prohibitively expensive undertaking, only partly subsidized by the fur trade. This led to a scaling back of the original plans. By 1628, a smaller fort was constructed with walls containing a mixture of clay and sand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fort also served as the center of trading activity. It contained a barracks, the church, a house for the West India Company director and a warehouse for the storage of company goods.[10] Troops from the fort used the triangle between the Heerestraat and what came to be known as Whitehall Street for marching drills.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerhulst, with his council, was responsible for the selection of Manhattan as a permanent place of settlement and for situating Fort Amsterdam. He was replaced as the company director-general of New Amsterdam by Peter Minuit in 1626. To legally safeguard the settlers' investments, possessions and farms on Manhattan island, Minuit negotiated the \\"purchase\\" of Manhattan from a Manahatta band of Lenape for 60 guilders' worth of trade goods. According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, Minuit conducted the transaction with the Lenape chief Seyseys, who was only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.[11] The deed itself has not survived, so the specific details are unknown. A textual reference to the deed became the foundation for the legend that Minuit had purchased Manhattan from the Native Americans for twenty-four dollars' worth of trinkets and beads, the guilder rate at the time being about two and a half to a Spanish dollar. The price of 60 Dutch guilders in 1626 amounts to around $1,100 in 2012 dollars.[12] Further complicating the calculation is that the value of goods in the area would have been different than the value of those same goods in the developed market of the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch exploited the hydropower of existing creeks by constructing mills at Turtle Bay (between present-day East 45th-48th Streets) and Montagne's Kill, later called Harlem Mill Creek (East 108th Street). In 1639 a sawmill was located in the northern forest at what was later the corner of East 74th Street and Second Avenue, at which African laborers cut lumber.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Amsterdam settlement had a population of approximately 270 people, including infants.[15] In 1642 the new director-general Willem Kieft decided to build a stone church within the fort. The work was carried out by recent English immigrants, the brothers John and Richard Ogden. The church was finished in 1645 and stood until destroyed in the Slave Insurrection of 1741.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pen-and-ink view of New Amsterdam,[16][17] drawn on-the-spot and discovered in the map collection of the Austrian National Library in Vienna in 1991, provides a unique view of New Amsterdam as it appeared from Capske (small Cape) Rock in 1648. Capske Rock was situated in the water close to Manhattan between Manhattan and Noten Eylant, and signified the start of the East River roadstead.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Amsterdam received municipal rights on February 2, 1653, thus becoming a city. Albany, then named Beverwyck, received its city rights in 1652. Nieuw Haarlem, now known as Harlem, was formally recognized in 1658.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Jews known to have lived in New Amsterdam arrived in 1654. First to arrive were Solomon Pietersen and Jacob Barsimson, who sailed during the summer of 1654 directly from Holland, with passports that gave them permission to trade in the colony.[18] Then in early September, 23 Jewish refugees arrived from the formerly Dutch city of Recife, which had been conquered by the Portuguese in January 1654.[19] The director of New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, sought to turn them away but was ultimately overruled by the directors of the Dutch West India Company in Amsterdam.[20] Asser Levy, an Ashkenazi Jew who was one of the 23 refugees, eventually prospered and in 1661 became the first Jew to own a house in New Amsterdam, which also made him the first Jew known to have owned a house anywhere in North America.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1661 the Communipaw ferry was founded and began a long history of trans-Hudson ferry and ultimately rail and road transportation.[22] On September 15, 1655, New Amsterdam was attacked by 2,000 Indians as part of the Peach Tree War. They destroyed 28 farms, killed 100 settlers, and took 150 prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 27, 1664, while England and the Dutch Republic were at peace, four English frigates sailed into New Amsterdam's harbor and demanded New Netherland's surrender, whereupon New Netherland was provisionally ceded by Stuyvesant. On September 6, Stuyvesant sent lawyer Johannes de Decker and five other delegates to sign the official Articles of Capitulation.[contradictory] This was swiftly followed by the Second Anglo-Dutch War, between England and the Dutch Republic. In June 1665, New Amsterdam was reincorporated under English law as New York City, named after the Duke of York (later King James II). He was the brother of the English King Charles II, who had been granted the lands.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1664, Jan van Bonnel built a saw mill on East 74th Street and the East River, where a 13,710-meter long stream that began in the north of today's Central Park, which became known as the Saw Kill or Saw Kill Creek, emptied into the river.[24][25] Later owners of the property George Elphinstone and Abraham Shotwell replaced the saw mill with a leather mill in 1677.[24][26] The Saw Kill was later redirected into a culvert, arched over, and its trickling little stream was called Arch Brook.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1667 the Treaty of Breda ended the conflict. The Dutch did not press their claims on New Netherland. In return, they were granted the tiny Island of Run in North Maluku, rich in nutmegs, and a guarantee for their de facto possession of Suriname, captured by them that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch briefly and quickly occupied New York City and renamed it New Orange.[27] Anthony Colve was installed as the first governor. Previously there had only been West India Company directors. After the signing of the Treaty of Westminster in November 1674, the city was relinquished to the English and the name reverted to \\"New York\\". Suriname became an official Dutch possession in return.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginnings of New Amsterdam, unlike most other colonies in the New World, were thoroughly documented in city maps. During the time of New Netherland's colonization, the Dutch were the pre-eminent cartographers in Europe. The delegated authority of the Dutch West India Company over New Netherland required maintaining sovereignty on behalf of the States General, generating cash flow through commercial enterprise for its shareholders, and funding the province's growth. Thus its directors regularly required that censuses be taken. These tools to measure and monitor the province's progress were accompanied by accurate maps and plans. These surveys, as well as grassroots activities to seek redress of grievances,[17] account for the existence of some of the most important of the early documents.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a particularly detailed city map called the Castello Plan produced in 1660. Virtually every structure in New Amsterdam at the time is believed to be represented, and by a fortunate coincidence it can be determined who resided in every house from the Nicasius de Sille List of 1660, which enumerates all the citizens of New Amsterdam and their addresses.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city map known as the Duke's Plan probably derived from the same 1660 census as the Castello Plan. The Duke's Plan includes the earliest suburban development on Manhattan (the two outlined areas along the top of the plan). The work was created for James (1633ÿ1701), the duke of York and Albany, after whom New York City and New York State's capital Albany were named, just after the seizure of New Amsterdam by the British.[30] After that provisional relinquishment of New Netherland, Stuyvesant reported to his superiors that he \\"had endeavored to promote the increase of population, agriculture and commerce...the flourishing condition which might have been more flourishing if the now afflicted inhabitants had been protected by a suitable garrison...and had been helped with the long sought for settlement of the boundary, or in default thereof had they been seconded with the oft besought reinforcement of men and ships against the continual troubles, threats, encroachments and invasions of the British neighbors and government of Hartford Colony, our too powerful enemies.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existence of these city maps has proven to be very useful in the archaeology of New York City. For instance, the Castello map aided the excavation of the Stadthuys (City Hall) of New Amsterdam in determining the exact location of the building.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maps enable a precise reconstruction of the town. Fort Amsterdam was located at the most southern tip of the island of Manhattan, which today is surrounded by Bowling Green. The Battery is a reference to its batteries, or cannons.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroadway was the main street that led out of town north towards Harlem. The town was surrounded to the north by a wall leading from the eastern to the western shore. The course of this city wall is today Wall Street. A canal led from the harbor inland and was filled in 1676, which today is Broad Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe layout of the streets was winding, as in a European city. Only starting from Wall Street going toward uptown did the typical grid become enforced long after the town ceased to be Dutch. Most of the Financial District overlaps New Amsterdam and has retained the original street layout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1625 date of the founding of New Amsterdam is now commemorated in the official Seal of New York City. (Formerly, the year on the seal was 1664, the year of the provisional Articles of Transfer, assuring New Netherlanders that they \\"shall keep and enjoy the liberty of their consciences in religion\\", negotiated with the English by Peter Stuyvesant and his council.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes considered a dysfunctional trading post by the English who later acquired it from the Dutch, Russell Shorto, author of The Island at the Center of the World, suggests that the city left its cultural marks on later New York and, by extension, the United States as a whole.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor recent historical research has been based on a set of documents that have survived from that period, untranslated. They are the administrative records of the colony, unreadable by most scholars. Since the 1970s, a professor named Charles Gehring has made it his life's work to translate this first-hand history of the Colony of New Netherland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scholarly conclusion has largely been that the settlement of New Amsterdam is much more like current New York than previously thought. Cultural diversity and a mind-set that resembles the American Dream were already present in the first few years of this colony. Writers like Russell Shorto argue that the large influence of New Amsterdam on the American psyche has largely been overlooked in the classic telling of American beginnings, because of animosity between the English victors and the conquered Dutch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 17th-century architecture of New Amsterdam has completely vanished (affected by the fires of 1776 and 1835),[34][35] leaving only archaeological remnants. The original street plan of New Amsterdam has stayed largely intact, as have some houses outside Manhattan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presentation of the legacy of the unique culture of 17th-century New Amsterdam remains a concern of preservationists and educators. The National Park Service celebrated in 2009 the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's 1609 voyage on behalf of the Dutch with the New Amsterdam Trail.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch-American historian and journalist Hendrik Willem van Loon wrote in 1933 a work of alternative history entitled \\"If the Dutch Had Kept Nieuw Amsterdam\\" (in If, Or History Rewritten, edited by J. C. Squire, 1931, Simon & Schuster).\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar theme, at greater length, was taken up by writer Elizabeth Bear, who published the \\"New Amsterdam\\" series of detective stories that take place in a world where the city remained Dutch until the Napoleonic Wars and retained its name also afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of New York Broadway theatres is the New Amsterdam Theatre. The name New Amsterdam is also written on the architrave situated on top of the row of columns in front of the Manhattan Municipal Building, commemorating the name of the Dutch colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough no architectural monuments or buildings have survived, the legacy lived on in the form Dutch Colonial Revival architecture. A number of structures in New York City were constructed in the 19th and 20th centuries in this style, such as Wallabout Market in Brooklyn, South William Street in Manhattan, West End Collegiate Church at West 77th Street, and others.","input":"What is the original name of new york?"},{"output":"commenced publication on December 3, 1847","context":"The North Star was a nineteenth-century anti-slavery newspaper published from the Talman Building in Rochester, New York by abolitionist Frederick Douglass.[1] The paper commenced publication on December 3, 1847 and ceased as The North Star in June 1851 when it merged with Gerrit Smith's Liberty Party Paper (based in Syracuse, New York) to form Frederick Douglass' Paper.[2] The North Star's slogan was \\"Right is of no SexTruth is of no ColorGod is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846, Frederick Douglass was first inspired to publish The North Star after subscribing to The Liberator, a weekly newspaper published by William Lloyd Garrison. The Liberator was a newspaper established by Garrison and his supporters founded upon moral principles.[2] The North Star title was a reference to the directions given to runaway slaves trying to reach the Northern states and Canada: Follow the North Star.[4] Published weekly, The North Star was four pages long and sold by subscription at the cost of $2 per year to more than 4,000 readers in the United States, Europe, and the West Indies. The first of its four pages focused on current events concerning abolitionist issues.[5]\\r\\nThe Garrisonian Liberator was founded upon the notion that the Constitution was fundamentally pro-slavery and that the Union ought to be dissolved. Douglass disagreed but supported the nonviolent approach to the emancipation of slaves by education and moral suasion.[6] Under the guidance of the abolitionist society, Douglass became well acquainted with the pursuit of the emancipation of slaves through a New England religious perspective.[7] Garrison had earlier convinced the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society to hire Douglass as an agent, touring with Garrison and telling audiences about his experiences in slavery Douglass worked with another abolitionist, Martin R. Delany, who traveled to lecture, report, and generate subscriptions to The North Star.[4]\\r\\nDouglass' thoughts toward political inaction changed when he attended the National Convention of Colored Citizens, an antislavery convention in Buffalo, New York, in August 1843. One of the many speakers present at the convention was Henry Highland Garnet. Formerly a slave in Maryland, Garnet was a Presbyterian minister who supported violent action against slaveholders. Garnet's demands of independent action addressed to the American slaves remained one of the leading issues of change for Douglass.\\r\\nDuring a nineteen-month stay in Britain and Ireland, several of Douglass supporters bought his freedom and assisted with the purchase of a printing press. With this assistance Douglass was determined to begin an African-American newspaper that would engage the anti-slavery movement politically. On his return to the United States in March 1847, Douglass shared his ideas of The North Star with his mentors. Ignoring the advice of the American Anti-Slavery Society, Douglass moved to Rochester, New York to publish the first edition. When questioned on his decision to create The North Star, Douglass is said to have responded,\\r\\n\\"I still see before me a life of toil and trials..., but, justice must be done, the truth must be told...I will not be silent.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn covering politics in Europe, literature, slavery in the United States, and culture generally in both The North Star and Frederick Douglass' Paper, Douglass achieved an unconstrained independence to write freely on topics from the California Gold Rush to Uncle Tom's Cabin to Charles Dickens's Bleak House.[9]","input":"When did frederick douglass published the north star?"},{"output":"Bridgestone Arena","context":"The Country Music Association Awards, also known as the CMA Awards or CMAs, are presented to country music artists and broadcasters to recognize outstanding achievement in the country music industry.[1][2] The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists, with occasional appearances from pop and rock artists.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first CMA awards were presented at an untelevised ceremony at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium in 1967; the Entertainer of the Year award that night went to Eddy Arnold. The second annual CMA awards were presented in October 1968; NBC taped the ceremony and televised it a few weeks later. Since then, the awards have been televised live, usually in October or November, by NBC from 1969 through 1971, by CBS from 1972 through 2005, and by ABC beginning in 2006. Starting in 1968 they were held at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry (initially at Ryman Auditorium, and from 1974 through 2004 at the new Grand Ole Opry House).\\r\\nIn 2005, the awards show was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Nine awards are also given to radio broadcasters for Station of the Year and Personality of the Year (divided into four categories each, based on market size), as well as National Personality of the Year to the host of a nationally syndicated show.[1] Since 2012, the ceremony features a Lifetime Achievement Award.[5]\\r\\nBrad Paisley and Carrie Underwood have co-hosted the ceremonies together since 2008.

This \\"cultural decade\\" is more loosely defined than the actual decade, beginning around 1963 with the Kennedy assassination and ending around 1974 with the Watergate scandal.[2][3]\\r\\n\\"The Sixties\\", as they are known in both scholarship and popular culture, is a term used by historians, journalists, and other objective academics; in some cases nostalgically to describe the counterculture and revolution in social norms about clothing, music, drugs, dress, sexuality, formalities, and schooling; and in others pejoratively to denounce the decade as one of irresponsible excess, flamboyance, and decay of social order. The decade was also labeled the Swinging Sixties because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos especially relating to racism and sexism that occurred during this time. Commentator Christopher Booker[4] described this era as a classical Jungian nightmare cycle, where a rigid culture, unable to contain the demands for greater individual freedom, broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm. He charts the rise, success, fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s. Several Western nations such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and West Germany turned to the political left in the early and mid-1960s.\\r\\nBy the end of the 1950s, war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom. World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared. There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s, many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator, and motor vehicle. Meanwhile, the East such as the Soviet union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. The United States, after sluggish economic growth during the 1950s, also experienced a major '60s boom. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade. Thus, the overall worldwide economic trend in the 1960s was one of prosperity, expansion of the middle class, and the proliferation of new domestic technology.\\r\\nThe confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union dominated geopolitics during the '60s, with the struggle expanding into developing nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia as the Soviet Union moved from being a regional to a truly global superpower and began vying for influence in the developing world. After President Kennedy's assassination, direct tensions between the US and Soviet Union cooled and the superpower confrontation moved into a contest for control of the Third World, a battle characterized by proxy wars, funding of insurgencies, and puppet governments.\\r\\nIn response to civil disobedience campaigns from groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), U.S. President John F. Kennedy, a Keynesian[5] and staunch anti-communist, pushed for social reforms. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 was a shock. Liberal reforms were finally passed under Lyndon B. Johnson including civil rights for African Americans and healthcare for the elderly and the poor. Despite his large-scale Great Society programs, Johnson was increasingly reviled by the New Left at home and abroad. The heavy-handed American role in the Vietnam War outraged student protestors around the globe. The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. upon working with underpaid Tennessee garbage collectors and the anti-Vietnam War movement, and the police response towards protesters of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, defined politics of violence in the United States.\\r\\nIn Western Europe and Japan, organizations such as those present at May 1968, the Red Army Faction, and the Zengakuren tested liberal democracy's ability to satisfy its marginalized or alienated citizenry amidst post-industrial age hybrid capitalist economies. In Britain, the Labour Party gained power in 1964.[6] In France, the protests of 1968 led to President Charles de Gaulle temporarily fleeing the country.[7] For some, May 1968 meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by the so-called new social movements.[8] Italy formed its first left-of-center government in March 1962 with a coalition of Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, and moderate Republicans. Socialists joined the ruling block in December 1963. In Brazil, Jo?o Goulart became president after Janio Quadros resigned. In Africa the 1960s was a period of radical political change as 32 countries gained independence from their European colonial rulers.\\r\\nProminent coups d'tat of the decade included:\\r\\nNote: Names of country leaders shown below in bold face remained in power continuously throughout the entirety of the decade.\\r\\n John F.

In his campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to \\"get America moving again.\\" His goal was economic growth of 4ÿ6% per year and unemployment below 4%, to do this he instituted a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment. By the end of the decade, median family income had risen from $8,540 in 1963 to $10,770 by 1969.[19]\\r\\nAlthough the first half of the decade had low inflation, by 1966 Kennedy's tax credit had reduced unemployment to 3.7% and inflation remained below 2%. With the economy booming Johnson began his \\"Great Society\\" which vastly expanded social programs. By the end of the decade under Nixon, the combined inflation and unemployment rate known as the misery index (economics) had exploded to nearly 10% with inflation at 6.2% and unemployment at 3.5% and by 1975 the misery index was almost 20%.[20]\\r\\nThe 1960s were marked by several notable assassinations:\\r\\nNatural:\\r\\nNon-natural:\\r\\nIn the second half of the decade, young people began to revolt against the conservative norms of the time, as well as remove themselves from mainstream liberalism, in particular the high level of materialism which was so common during the era. This created a \\"counterculture\\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as hippies. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the sexual revolution, questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The Underground Press, a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including LSD and marijuana) and psychedelic music.\\r\\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the Vietnam War, ending in the massive Moratorium protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to conscription (\\"the Draft\\") for the war.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe antiwar movement was initially based on the older 1950s Peace movement, heavily influenced by the American Communist Party, but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \\"sit-in\\". Other terms heard in the United States included \\"the Draft\\", \\"draft dodger\\", \\"conscientious objector\\", and \\"Vietnam vet\\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \\"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\\"\\r\\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African-Americans in the United States aimed at outlawing racial discrimination against black Americans and restoring voting rights to them. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include racial dignity, economic and political self-sufficiency, and anti-imperialism.\\r\\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of civil resistance. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of civil disobedience and nonviolent protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955ÿ1956) in Alabama; \\"sit-ins\\" such as the influential Greensboro sit-ins (1960) in North Carolina; marches, such as the Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.\\r\\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964,[22] that banned discrimination based on \\"race, color, religion, or national origin\\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that restored and protected voting rights; the Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965, that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\\r\\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the Mexican-Americans, are among other Hispanics in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations was in the Southwestern United States, such as California with over 1 million Chicanos in Los Angeles alone, and Texas where Jim Crow laws included Mexican-Americans as \\"non-white\\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\\r\\nSocially, the Chicano Movement addressed what it perceived to be negative ethnic stereotypes of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official bilingualism in federal and state governments.\\r\\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens, was formed in 1929 and remains active today.[23]\\r\\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the American G.I. Forum, which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.[24]\\r\\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 Mendez v. Westminster U.S. Supreme Court ruling which declared that segregating children of \\"Mexican and Latin descent\\" was unconstitutional and the 1954 Hernandez v. Texas ruling which declared that Mexican Americans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.[25][26]\\r\\nThe most prominent civil-rights organization in the Mexican-American community, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), was founded in 1968.[27] Although modeled after the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Puerto Ricans in the U.S. mainland fought against racism, police brutality and socioeconomic problems affecting the three million Puerto Ricans residing in 50 states, the main concentration was in New York City.\\r\\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.ÿMexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the Cuban American community in Miami, Florida.\\r\\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture. A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \\"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \\"all men are created equal...\\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\\r\\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning de jure inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and de facto inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. Commercials often portrayed a woman as being helpless if her car broke down. In the U.S., a Presidential Commission on the Status of Women found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title IX, etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success. Feminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, writing books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with Betty Friedan's revolutionary book, The Feminine Mystique, the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the National Organization for Women. In 1968, \\"Women's Liberation\\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the Civil Rights Movement when New York Radical Women, led by Robin Morgan, protested the annual Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The movement continued throughout the next decades. Gloria Steinem was a key feminist.\\r\\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement. These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that gay men and women are no different from those who are straight and deserve full equality. This philosophy would be dominant again after AIDS, but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging gay pride.\\r\\nThe symbolic birth of the gay rights movement would not come until the decade had almost come to a close. Gays were not allowed by law to congregate. Gay establishments such as the Stonewall Inn in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people. On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets. This uprising called the Stonewall Riots began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\\r\\nThe rapid rise of a \\"New Left\\" applied the class perspective of Marxism to postwar America, but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the Communist Party, and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of C. Wright Mills, the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based Trotskyist, Maoist and anarchist groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to militancy.\\r\\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidences of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.[28] Large riots broke out in many cities like Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, New Jersey, Oakland, California and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like George Wallace and Richard Nixon campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\\r\\nThe Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into outer space during the Vostok 1 mission on 12 April 1961 and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set for the U.S. the goal of a manned spacecraft landing on the Moon by the end of the decade.\\r\\nIn June 1963, Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the Solar system (Venus), Venera 3, and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the moon, Luna 9. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched Luna 10, which became the first space probe to enter orbit around the Moon.\\r\\nThe deaths of astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee in the Apollo 1 fire on 27 January 1967 put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the Apollo 8 crew (Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, William Anders) being the first manned mission to orbit another celestial body (the moon) during Christmas of 1968.\\r\\nOn 20 July 1969, Apollo 11, the first human spaceflight landed on the Moon. Launched on 16 July 1969, it carried mission Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and the Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin. Apollo 11 fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's goal of reaching the moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \\"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\"\\r\\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer Sergey Korolyov in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the moon.\\r\\nA succession of unmanned American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, Venus, and Mars during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\\r\\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with muscle cars sold by most makes. The compact Ford Mustang, launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \\"Big Three\\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of Studebaker in 1966 left American Motors Corporation as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included compact and mid-sized cars in addition to full-sized ones.\\r\\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the Renault 16many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The Mini, released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\\r\\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the Toyota Corolla, Datsun 510, and the first popular Japanese sports car, the Datsun 240Z, were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\\r\\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the Summer of Love in San Francisco in 1967, and the Woodstock Festival in upstate New York in 1969. Psychedelic drugs, especially LSD, were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by Timothy Leary with his slogan \\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\\". Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters also played a part in the role of \\"turning heads on\\". Psychedelic influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see 27 Club). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\\r\\nThe rock-and-roll movement of the 1950s quickly came to an end in 1959 as explained in the song Day The Music Died, the revelation that Jerry Lee Lewis had married his 13 year old cousin, and the induction of Elvis Presley into the US Army. As the 1960s began, the major rock-and-roll stars of the '50s such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard had dropped off the charts and popular music in the US came to be dominated by Motown girl groups and novelty pop songs. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the American folk music revival which introduced Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, The Kingston Trio, Harry Belafonte, Bob Dylan, Odetta, and many other Singer-songwriters to the public.\\r\\nGirl groups and singers such as the Shirelles, Betty Everett, Little Eva, the Temptations, and the Supremes dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were African-American, but white singers such as Lesley Gore emerged by 1963.\\r\\nAround the same time, record producer Phil Spector began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the Wall of Sound. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\\r\\nAlso during the early '60s, surf rock emerged, a genre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance. The Beach Boys quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely overshadowed the many lesser artists in the genre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963ÿ65, then gradually gave way to bands influenced by the counterculture movement.\\r\\nWhile rock 'n' roll had 'disappeared' from the US charts in the early '60s, it never died out in Europe and Britain in particular was a hotbed of rock-and-roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour. A few months later, rock-and-roll founding father Chuck Berry emerged from a 2-1/2 year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\\r\\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll ÿ as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes ÿ and wore leather jackets. Their manager Brian Epstein encouraged the group to wear suits. Beatlemania abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album Rubber Soul which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the Rolling Stones and the Kinks who would become legends in their own right.\\r\\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist Jimi Hendrix emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\\r\\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \\"serious\\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\\r\\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\\r\\nJazz music during the first half of the '60s was largely a continuation of '50s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as John Coltrane and Nat King Cole precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late '60s largely spelled the end of jazz as a mainstream form of music, after it had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\\r\\nSignificant events in music in the 1960s:\\r\\nThe highest-grossing film of the decade was 20th Century Fox's The Sound of Music (1965).[32]\\r\\nSome of Hollywood's most notable blockbuster films of the 1960s include:\\r\\nThe counterculture movement had a significant effect on cinema. Movies began to break social taboos such as sex and violence causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the New Hollywood era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as Roger Vadim's Barbarella (1968) as the counterculture progressed.\\r\\nIn Europe, Art Cinema gains wider distribution and sees movements like la Nouvelle Vague (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as Roger Vadim, Fran?ois Truffaut, Alain Resnais, and Jean-Luc Godard; Cinma vrit documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, Chilean filmmaker Alexandro Jodorowsky and Polish filmmakers Roman Polanski and Wojciech Jerzy Has produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of Italian filmmaking with Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: La Dolce Vita, 8?; La Notte; L'Eclisse, The Red Desert; Blowup; Fellini Satyricon; Accattone; The Gospel According to St. Matthew; Theorem; Winter Light; The Silence; Persona; Shame; A Passion; Au Hasard Balthazar; Mouchette; Last Year at Marienbad; Chronique d'un t; Titicut Follies; High School; Salesman; La jete; Warrendale; Knife in the Water; Repulsion; The Saragossa Manuscript; El Topo; A Hard Day's Night; and the cinema verite Dont Look Back.\\r\\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the forty-seven ronin entitled Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki directed by Hiroshi Inagaki was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning Japanese director Akira Kurosawa produced Yojimbo (1961), and Sanjuro (1962), which both starred Toshiro Mifune as a mysterious Samurai swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The Spaghetti Western genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964) starring Clint Eastwood and Walter Hill's Last Man Standing (1996). Yojimbo was also the origin of the \\"Man with No Name\\" trend which included Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus Once Upon a Time in the West, starring Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, and Jason Robards. The Magnificent Seven a 1960 American western film directed by John Sturges was a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film, Seven Samurai.\\r\\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of light-weight and affordable cameras, the underground avant-garde film movement thrived. Canada's Michael Snow, Americans Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, Andy Warhol, and Jack Smith. Notable films in this genre are: Dog Star Man; Scorpio Rising; Wavelength; Chelsea Girls; Blow Job; Vinyl; Flaming Creatures.\\r\\nSignificant events in the film industry in the 1960s:\\r\\nThe most prominent American TV series of the 1960s include: The Ed Sullivan Show, Star Trek, Peyton Place, The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Andy Williams Show, The Dean Martin Show, The Wonderful World of Disney, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Beverly Hillbillies, Bonanza, Batman, McHale's Navy, Laugh-In, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Fugitive, The Tonight Show, Gunsmoke, The Andy Griffith Show, Gilligan's Island, Mission: Impossible, The Flintstones, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Lassie, The Danny Thomas Show, The Lucy Show, My Three Sons, The Red Skelton Show, Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie. The Flintstones was a favoured show, receiving 40 million views an episode with an average of 3 views a day. Some programming such as The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour became controversial by challenging the foundations of America's corporate and governmental controls; making fun of world leaders, and questioning U.S. involvement in and escalation of the Vietnam War.\\r\\nWalt Disney, the founder of the Walt Disney Co. died on 15 December 1966, from a major tumor in his left lung.\\r\\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1960s include:\\r\\nThe publication of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published.[33] Following the trial, in 1964ÿ65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus.[34]\\r\\nThere were six Olympic Games held during the decade. These were:\\r\\nThere were two FIFA World Cups during the decade:\\r\\nMajor League Baseball expansion in 1961 included the formation of the Los Angeles Angels, the move to Minnesota to become the Minnesota Twins by the former Washington Senators and the formation of a new franchise called the Washington Senators. Major League Baseball sanctioned both the Houston Colt .45s and the New York Mets as new National League franchises in 1962.\\r\\nIn 1969, the American League expanded when the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots, were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres. By 1969, at the end of the 1960s the New York Mets won the World Series in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\\r\\nThe NBA tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the Boston Celtics, who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as Bob Cousy, Bill Russell and John Havlicek. Other notable NBA players included Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Oscar Robertson.\\r\\nAt the NCAA level, the UCLA Bruins also proved dominant. Coached by John Wooden, they were helped by Lew Alcindor and by Bill Walton to win championships and dominate the American college basketball landscape during the decade.\\r\\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the counterculture. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a Frisbee.[35] Starting with promotional efforts from Wham-O and Irwin Toy (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using Frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events, disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court, guts, disc ultimate and disc golf became this sports first events.[36][37] Two sports, the team sport of disc ultimate and disc golf are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi professionally.[38][39] The World Flying Disc Federation, Professional Disc Golf Association and the Freestyle Players Association are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide. Major League Ultimate (MLU) and the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) are the first semi professional ultimate leagues\\r\\nIn motorsports, the Can-Am and Trans-Am series were both established in 1966. The Ford GT40 won outright in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Graham Hill edged out Jackie Stewart and Denny Hulme for the World Championship in Formula One.\\r\\nThe following articles contain brief timelines which list the most prominent events of the decade:\\r\\n1960 ? 1961 ? 1962 ? 1963 ? 1964 ? 1965 ? 1966 ? 1967 ? 1968 ? 1969 ?

The credit may depend on other factors as well, such as income level. For example, in the United States only families making less than $110,000 per year may claim the full credit. Similarly, in the United Kingdom the tax credit is only available for families making less than S42,000 per year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany has a programme called the \\"Kinderfreibetrag\\"?(de) which functions as a tax credit. The child allowance is an allowance in German tax law, which a certain amount of money is tax-free in the taxation of parents. In the income tax fee paid, child benefit and tax savings through the child tax credit are compared against each other, and the parents pay whichever results in the lesser amount of tax.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, a family with children and an income below about S32,200 can claim child tax credit on top of child benefit. The tax credit is \\"non-wastable\\" ÿ it is paid whether or not the family has a net tax liability ÿ and is paid in or out of work. Higher rates are paid for disabled children. It is integrated with the working tax credit, which also provides support for childcare costs.\\r\\nAll taxable income is tested for the credit, so a couple who both work and have children, will have both salaries taken into account. Tax Credits may be capped which it is claimed could affect the poorest families disproportionately. On Monday 26th October 2015 the House of Lords voted for Labour proposals for financial redress to those affected by reduced entitlements.[1]\\r\\nThere are several different credits that a taxpayer can claim in the United States. One of the most common is the Child Tax Credit, provided by 26 U.S.C. Sec. 24. After $110,000 it phases out at the rate of $50 for each additional $1,000 (or portion of $1,000) earned above $110,000.[2]\\r\\nFor a relatively small number of families, the child tax credit will exceed their tax liability. In many such cases, the unused portion of the child tax credit is refundable as the \\"additional child tax credit.\\" The amount that is available as a refund depends on the amount of earned income, and in certain circumstances the amount of social security and medicare taxes paid. Refer to IRS form 8812 and instructions.\\r\\nThe child tax credit is available to taxpayers who have a qualifying child. The full credit is only available if the family makes less than $110K per year. A person is a qualifying child if he or she has not attained the age of 17 by the end of the taxable year and meets the requirements of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 152(c). In general, a qualifying child is any individual for whom the taxpayer can claim a dependency exemption and who is the taxpayers son or daughter (or descendent of either), stepson or stepdaughter (or descendent of either), or eligible foster child.\\r\\nThe per-child amount was originally capped at $400 in 1998 (and $500 in 1999) by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) set a graduated increase of the cap from $600 beginning in 2001 to $1,000 in 2010, but then reverting to $500.[3] The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) increased the amount to $1,000 for 2003 and 2004. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extended this amount through 2010.[3] The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended this $1,000 cap through the end of 2012.[4] The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made the $1,000 cap permanent.[5]\\r\\nA taxpayers total tax credit is refundable to the extent of the greater of 15% of the taxpayers earned income over $3,000 (new for 2009) (an amount adjusted for inflation IAW 26 U.S.C. Sec. 24(d)(3)) or, as long as the taxpayer has three or more qualifying children, the excess of social security taxes paid over earned income credit, all subject to the income threshold. Unless a married couple files jointly, a qualifying child will be treated as such for the purpose of the Child Tax Credit for the taxpayer who is the childs parent, or if not a parent, the taxpayer with the highest adjusted gross income for the taxable year in accordance with 26 U.S.C. Sec. 152(c)(4)(A). If more than one parent claims the child and do not file a joint return, the child will be treated as a qualifying child of the parent with whom the child resided for the longest period during the taxable year, and if the child resided with each parent equally, with the parent who has the highest adjusted gross income in accordance with 26 U.S.C. Sec. 152(c)(4)(B).\\r\\nThe tax credit is believed to have lifted about 3 million children out of poverty in 2016.[6] In 2017 the Trump administration, led by Ivanka Trump, was seeking to expand the tax credit for the first time since 2001.[6]","input":"When was the additional child tax credit introduced?"},{"output":"Coton in the Elms","context":"Coton in the Elms is a village and parish in the English county of Derbyshire. At 70 miles from the coast, it is the furthest place in England from the sea. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 896.[1] It is located 5 miles southwest of Swadlincote and 6 miles south of Burton upon Trent.\\r\\nLess than a mile southeast of the village is Church Flatts Farm, which is defined by the Ordnance Survey as the furthest point from the sea in Great Britain.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoton is mentioned over a thousand years ago when land was transferred to Wulfrige the Black in AD942.[4] It is also on the salt route known as Walton Way, which starts in nearby Walton-on-Trent.[5]\\r\\nCoton in the Elms is mentioned in the Domesday book where it is then spelt Cotes. The book says[6] under the title of The lands of the Abbey of Burton\\".[n 1]\\r\\n\\"In Coton in the Elms ?lfgar had two carucates of land to the geld. There is land for three ploughs. Now the abbot has it of the king. There are now one plough in demesne and six villans and three bordars having two ploughs. TRE worth 40 shillings now 30 shillings.\\"[n 2]\\r\\nCoton is situated on the Walton Way and is first mentioned in 942 in a charter giving land in the area to Wulfrige the Black. This formed part of a much larger estate covering many of the villages in the area. Coton would seem to have been roughly in the centre of this estate. It would appear that it was a crossroads as there is an old lane which runs all the way from Tamworth through Coton and on northwards towards Burton on Trent. At the time of Domesday Burton Abbey held land at Coton - however this had been initially seized by King William - no doubt in part due to the rebellion led by Earl Morcar. However, by the time of Domesday this land had been restored to Burton. The village itself forms a diamond of roads around a small village green. The original route of the Walton Way may have been the south west corner of this diamond as this runs past the Church and Church Farm. To the north east of the village coal mining became important and this is reflected in the lane name Coalpit Lane.\\r\\nThe present church of St Mary was built in 1844-7 by Henry Isaac Stevens but not on the site of the original church, which was behind the Shoulder of Mutton pub. It has a narrow west tower with a recessed spire. It is generally believed that when the original church fell into disrepair, the bells were taken to the neighbouring Lullington village, so the inhabitants of Coton can still hear the old bells when the wind is in the right direction.\\r\\nThere is a Methodist chapel, built in 1922 to replace a smaller building in Chapel Street. The old building became known as the band room, where for many years a good band was run by a Mr Coates, who was also the village post master. It has also been used as a village hall.\\r\\nThe main occupations of the village inhabitants in the past has been mining and farming, though the pits are now all closed. For many of today's population (782 in 1991) it is a commuter base for the larger towns such as Burton-on-Trent, Swadlincote and Tamworth.\\r\\nCoton in the Elms has 2 pubs. The Black Horse was refurbished in 2009. The Queen's Head Inn dates back to the 17th century, part of the premises was once a shop. Another pub, the Shoulder of Mutton, closed in 2010 and is currently being converted to a house.\\r\\nSoutheast of the village ÿ at grid reference SK253144 ÿ is Church Flatts Farm, which is calculated by the Ordnance Survey to be the farthest point from the sea (at the mean low water line) in Great Britain.[2] The location is Latitude: 52 43.6' N Longitude: 1 37.2' W. This place in Coton was chosen as equidistant from Fosdyke Wash in Lincolnshire; White Sands between Neston in Cheshire and Flint, Flintshire in Wales; and Westbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire ÿ all of which are 113 kilometres (70?mi) away.[2][3]\\r\\nThe nearest high tide point is on the River Trent at Cromwell Lock, north of Newark-on-Trent, in Nottinghamshire, 72 kilometres (45?mi) away.[2]","input":"What is the most landlocked place in england?"},{"output":"fanbase","context":"The 12th man or 12th player is a term for fans of teams in eleven-a-side sports games, particularly association football (soccer) or American football. As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time, referring to a team's fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful role in the game. Infrequently, the term has referred to individuals having a notable connection to their football team. In Canadian football, 12 players are usually on the field at one time and the term 13th man is often used to refer to fans. Similarly, in Australian rules football, 18 players are on the field and the fans are often referred to as the 19th man. The term has a different meaning in cricket, referring instead to the first substitute player who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured (the term 6th man has a similar connotation in basketball).\\r\\nThe presence of fans can have a profound impact on how the teams perform, an element in the home advantage. Namely, the home team fans would like to see their team win the game. Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or chant in hopes of distracting, demoralizing and confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision. Noises are made by shouting, whistling, stomping and various other techniques. In American football, the sideline is sometimes also referred to as the \\"12th man\\" or \\"12th defender\\": since a player is considered down when he steps out of bounds, the sideline effectively acts as an extra defender. This usage is less common than the one referring to the fans.\\r\\nThe term can also be construed as implying that the referee is not impartial.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded use of the term \\"twelfth man\\" was a magazine published by the University of Minnesota in September, 1900, that referred to \\"the mysterious influence of the twelfth man on the team, the rooter.\\"[2] Later, in the November 1912 edition of The Iowa Alumnus, an alumni publication of the University of Iowa (then known as State University of Iowa), E.A. McGowan described the 1903 game between Iowa and the University of Illinois. In his article, titled \\"The Twelfth Player\\" McGowan wrote: \\"The eleven men had done their best; but the twelfth man on the team (the loyal spirited Iowa rooter) had won the game for old S.U.I.\\"[3]\\r\\nAn early reference to the numerical \\"12th Man\\" term occurred at the 1922 Dixie Classic, featuring Centre College and The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (later known as Texas A&M). During the game, A&M coach Dana X. Bible realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. Coach Bible remembered E. King Gill, an A&M basketball player who moonlighted on the football team. Gill had traveled from College Station with the team, but had not dressed. He'd been assigned by Bible to work up in the press box as a spotter for Waco News-Tribune sports editor Jinx Tucker. Gill was called down to the field, where he went beneath the crowded stands and donned the uniform of an injured Aggie player. Then he assumed his place on the Aggie sideline and in A&M football history. The Aggies won the game 22-14, but Gill's services were never needed. Gill later said, \\"I wish I could say that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me.\\"[4] Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play was noted.\\r\\nOther individuals have occasionally been labeled by local media as the \\"Twelfth Man\\" of their team. In 1930, W. H. Adamson, Principal of Oak Cliff (Dallas) High School was called the \\"Twelfth Man\\" of the school's American football team by a local reporter due to the rousing pre-game speeches he would give to the players.[5]\\r\\nIn the 1935 Princeton-Dartmouth game before 56,000 fans who braved the snow and cold,[6] spectator Mike Mesco was initially reported to have left his seat from the stands to join the Dartmouth defensive line and was referred to in a local newspaper as the \\"Twelfth Dartmouth Man.\\"[7] As it turned out it was not Mesko but George Larsen of Cranford, N.J., who dashed from the stands to aid Dartmouth in her game with Princeton.[8] Asa Bushnell III, Princeton class of 1947, wrote of the incident in 1960 for the Princeton Athletic News: \\"Strange as it may seem, it was a young architect from Cranford, N.J., a refugee[clarification needed] from the University of Cincinnati, no less - who immortalized the activities in Palmer Stadium on November 23, 1935. It was he who, midway through the fourth period that tingling afternoon, left the other 55,999 spectators in their seats to assist the Dartmouth Indians in a determined goal-line stand. It was he who lined up with the Hanoverians on the two yard stripe and prevented Jack White from scoring - and White boasted interference from the awesome likes of Johnny Weller and Homer Spofford. It was the daring \\"twelfth man\\" who, though escorted unceremoniously off the field and out of the stadium without further ado, gained a nationwide American football reputation in a single play.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe December 18, 1938, Dallas Morning News said \\"Whether they play now on a team, used to play back in the day, follow the game closely or just quarterback from the grandstand occasionally, every American football enthusiast well knows how much that twelfth man in the stands means to any American football team. But that backing means unusually much in the traditional Thanksgiving game between the University of Texas and Texas A&M. With an uncertain monotony that has long since made game forecasters exceedingly skittish, these two win where their twelfth men help most.\\" Thus, in this single instance, the term \\"Twelfth Man\\" was used to refer to the fans of both schools playing.[10]\\r\\nThe term \\"12th man\\" is commonly used in football to refer to the fans and occasionally the manager. A notable club famous for the twelfth man reference comes from Aston Villa, referring to the Holte End stand at Villa Park. Large European and Asian teams such as Bayern Munich, Foolad, Malm? FF, Hammarby IF, Werder Bremen, Aberdeen, Rangers, Paris Saint-Germain, Lazio, Feyenoord, Ferencvrosi TC, FC Red Star, Fenerbah?e S.K., and Sporting CP have officially retired the number 12 to the fans. Stockport County fans are registered as official members of their squad with the number 12.[citation needed] Portsmouth F.C. has also retired its number 12 shirt, and lists the club's supporters, \\"Pompey Fans\\", as player number 12 on the squad list printed in home match programmes,[citation needed] while Plymouth Argyle have theirs registered to the Green Army (the nickname for their fans).[citation needed] Number 12 is also reserved for the fans at many other clubs, including CSKA Moscow and Zenit Saint Petersburg in Russia, Bristol Rovers and Grimsby Town in England, as well as Aarhus Gymnastikforening (AGF), Odense Boldklub, also known as OB, in Denmark, Malm? FF and Hammarby IF in Sweden and Perth Glory in Australia. On Hammarby IF's, Feyenoord and Werder Bremen's home games, the stadium speaker announces number 12 as \\"the fans\\" during team lineup announcements.\\r\\nDynamo Dresden in Germany also keeps number 12 for their fans, as well as the official team anthem being \\"We are the 12th man\\". Aberdeen F.C. supporters commonly display a large banner in the shape of a football shirt with the text \\"Red Army 12\\" in place of a player's name and number.[citation needed] The fans of the Northern Ireland national football team and Derry City are referred to as the 12th man as well. In the League of Ireland Shamrock Rovers F.C. retired the number 12 jersey in recognition of the fans who took over the club in 2005. Cork City F.C., Clube Atltico Mineiro and Clube de Regatas do Flamengo also retired the number 12 for the fans.[citation needed] The most vociferous fans of Boca Juniors in Argentina are known as the \\"Jugador Numero 12\\" (Spanish for \\"Player Number 12\\") or simply \\"La Doce\\" (\\"The 12\\"). On September 18, 2004, U.S. Lecce, an Italian team currently playing in Serie A, retired the number 12 to the fans, which was handed to them by the former captain Cristian Ledesma. They symbolically represent a 12th Man in the field.[citation needed] In the beginning of 2009/2010 season, Happy Valley AA introduced the club's mascot, a panda, on squad list as the fan club captain wearing the number 12 jersey.[11] As of the end of the 2011/2012 season Rangers F.C announced that the number 12 jersey would be retired in honour of the fans support throughout a period of financial difficulty.[12]\\r\\nThe term has been used by various American football teams including the University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, Baylor University, Dartmouth College, Simmons College, Texas A&M and the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, Washington Redskins, Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins,[13] and Chicago Bears in marketing practices in reference to their supporters. The Bears currently use the phrase \\"4th Phase\\" (with the first three phases being offense, defense, and special teams),[14] and the Seahawks currently use the phrase \\"The 12s.\\" [15]\\r\\nMany high schools in the United States incorporate 12th Man language into their booster, supporter, or rooter clubs. Examples of such \\"12th Man Clubs\\" include the Alta Loma Braves,[16] Dana Hills Dolphins,[17] Washington Panthers,[18] Richwood Knights,[19] Diamond Bar Brahmas,[20] Fairfield Falcons,[21] and Brentwood Bruins.[22]\\r\\nThe Campbellsville University Tigers of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics also have a 12th Man Club.[23]\\r\\nOn December 12, 1992, (12/12/1992) the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League honored their 12th Man as the seventh inductee into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame, located inside of Ralph Wilson Stadium.[24] Their fans were inducted because of their loyal support during the team's early '90s Super Bowl runs.[25] In 2008, the Bills renamed their \\"12th Man Walk of Fame\\" as \\"Tim Russert Plaza,\\" in honor of the Buffalo native and lifelong fan.[26] The team continues to refer to their fans as the \\"12th Man,\\"[27][28][29] with their independent, international fan clubs known as \\"Bills Backers Chapters.\\"[30] The Bills have a licensing agreement with Texas A&M over the use of the \\"12th Man\\" term.[31][32]\\r\\nFans of the Indianapolis Colts of the NFL are known as the 12th Man.[33] The Colts created a Ring of Honor on September 23, 1996, after playing 13 seasons in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2007, the Colts inducted their 12th Man as the sixth entrant into the team's Ring of Honor, then located on the interior facade of the RCA Dome.[34] The Ring of Honor currently encircles Lucas Oil Stadium, the team's home venue. The organization also designates a \\"12th Man Fan of the Game\\".[35][36][37] On November 12, 2015, Texas A&M announced the filing of a lawsuit against the Colts based on the team's usage of the term.[38] On February 17, 2016, the lawsuit was settled with the Colts agreeing to remove the phrase from their Ring of Honor and to immediately cease all other uses of the trademarked phrase.[39]\\r\\nThe Seattle Seahawks retired the number 12 jersey on December 15, 1984, in honor of their fans. In 2003, the Seahawks installed a giant flagpole in the south endzone of what is now CenturyLink Field, and began a tradition of raising a giant flag with the number 12 on it in honor of the fans, but one of whom is Sam Adkins, the former Seahawks quarterback who did wear the number 12[40]. Usually, a local celebrity or a season ticket holder raises the flag during pregame ceremonies.[41] In recent years, 12th Man flags[42][43][44][45][46] have been seen all over Seattle whenever the Seahawks make the playoffs, including atop the Space Needle. In 2014, Boeing painted a Boeing 747-8 freighter with a special Seahawks livery, with the number 12 on the tail, and they later flew it over eastern Washington in a flight path spelling the number 12.[47][48] When the Seahawks took the field for Super Bowl XLVIII, they were led by LB Heath Farwell carrying the team's 12th Man flag[49][50] per team tradition.[51]\\r\\nThe Seahawks' 12th Man has twice set the Guinness World Record loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[52] [53] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6?dB.[54][55] As per an agreement struck between the Seahawks and Texas A&M in 2016, the Seahawks have virtually ceased from referring to their fans as the \\"12th Man\\",[56] and instead are using the term \\"12s\\".[57][58]\\r\\nThe first known instance of Texas A&M referring to its fanbase as the \\"12th Man\\" is contained on page 17 of 25 November 1921 edition of The Battalion, the Texas A&M campus newspaper.[59] Current Texas A&M students call themselves the 12th Man, and have done so continuously since the 1920s. Ever since the day E. King Gill left the stands in 1922, the entire student body has stood throughout the game to symbolize their \\"readiness, desire, and enthusiasm\\" to take the field if needed.[60] A statue of E. King Gill stands to the north of Kyle Field to remind Aggies of their constant obligation to preserve the spirit of the 12th Man.[4] Beginning in 1985, fans also began waving 12th Man Towels during the game to show their support. The tradition of towels started when coach Jackie Sherrill's 12th man squad began carrying them to motivate the student body in the stands.\\r\\nBecause the students are always waiting for the opportunity to support their team, they are also willing to share the credit for the team's good deeds. A popular Aggie tradition is that \\"when the team scores, everybody scores\\".[61] Whenever the Aggies score points during the game, students kiss their dates.[61]\\r\\nFootball coach Jackie Sherrill created the \\"12th Man Kick-Off Team\\" in the 1980s, composed of non-athletic scholarship students who tried out for the team. Coach Sherrill has written a book entitled \\"No Experience Required\\" which details this team and the tradition. These students were placed on the roster for the sole purpose of kickoffs. The squad was nicknamed \\"the suicide squad\\". These students often had little regard for their safety and were determined to make a tackle at any cost. [62][63] The 12th Man Kick-Off Team was extremely successful and eventually held opponents to one of the lowest yards-per-return average in the league during kickoffs.[when?][64] Later, head coach R. C. Slocum changed the team to allow only one representative of the 12th Man on the kick off team who wears uniform number 12.[4] The player is chosen based on the level of determination and hard work shown in practices. Under Dennis Franchione, the 12th Man Kick-Off Team composed of walk-ons was brought back, though used only rarely when the team was up by quite a few points.[65][66]\\r\\nOn June 30, 2014, Texas A&M bought the domain name 12thman.com, which then became its official athletics website.[67][68]\\r\\nIn 1986, the Washington Redskins released a video entitled \\"Thanks to the 12th Man\\".[69][70] A blogger on NFL.com considered it to be among the worst sports videos of all-time.[71]\\r\\nThe effects of the \\"12th man\\" vary widely, but can be put in two categories. The first is simply psychological, the effect of showing the home team that they are appreciated, and showing the away team that they are somewhat unwelcome. The second directly relates to the deafening effects of a loud crowd.\\r\\nIn association football, the crowd is very passionate and often sing throughout the whole match. Some occasions where the crowd noise is extra loud can be before kickoff; during the buildup to and scoring of a goal; when encouraging the team to come back from defeat; to discourage an opposition penalty taker; or to harass a referee giving a free kick to the opposition team.\\r\\nIn American football, fans are most incited by physical play, especially good plays made by the defense.[72] Additionally, the home team can derive energy from the loud noise of their fans; former American football players have described the feeling of their adrenaline pumping after hearing the fans yell, which is \\"like you have a reserve energy tank.\\"[73]\\r\\nThe noise of the crowd can have a significant impact on the players on the field. In American football, an extremely loud crowd can prevent the offensive linemen from hearing the snap count. This can have the effect of making the player slower to react when the ball is snapped, and his eventual response may be weaker than normal because each play is begun \\"with some indecision and doubt\\".[73] The noise can also prevent players from hearing audibles and can make it difficult for the team's offense to coordinate plays in the huddle. The effect of the noise can often be measured in mistakes, such as false start penalties.[74]\\r\\nCoaches can take steps to minimize the effect of the crowd noise on their teams. Some American football teams bring large speakers to their practice fields and broadcast loud noises such as jet engines to prepare their teams for the anticipated noise level.[75] Crowd noise tends to diminish after a long lull in play, such as a pause for instant replay. Former NFL player Brian Baldinger speculates that some coaches draw out reviews as part of a coaching strategy to quiet the crowd for their next play.[73]\\r\\nA researcher from Harvard University discovered in a study that some football referees appeared to be impacted by crowd noise. His studies revealed that a home team acquired an additional 0.1?goal advantage for every 10,000?fans in the stadium.[76]\\r\\nDelia Smith, Norwich City's joint major shareholder, received some attention when she took to the pitch during a half time interval, with a microphone in hand and Sky TV cameras in tow, to tell fans the side \\"need their twelfth man\\". \\"Where are you?\\" she cried. Norwich City lost the game in the final seconds, but Smith's passion worked to increase the affection the fans held for her.[77]\\r\\nThe current naturally loudest football stadium is the Turk Telecom Arena, in Turkey, host of the Galatasaray team[78]. As a prepared attempt, the current world record for crowd noise at an athletic event was set on September 29, 2014, when the Kansas City Chiefs hosted the New England Patriots. Noise during that event reached a high of 142.2 decibels during a timeout.[79][80]\\r\\nTexas A&M University applied on December 26, 1989, for trademark U.S. Ser. No. 74013898 related to usage of the term. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the \\"trademark registration\\" September 4, 1990, to Texas A&M. Four additional Trademark claims related to the \\"12th Man\\" term were also filed and granted at later dates by Texas A&M University (See U.S. Ser. Nos. 74560726, 76671314, 85977835 and 85851199), the first three of which have achieved Incontestable Status[jargon] as a result of its section 15 affidavit with the Patent and Trademark Office. According to former Texas A&M Athletic Director Bill Byrne, he contacted the Chicago Bears and Buffalo Bills about halting their \\"12th Man\\" themes.[81] Byrne stated that, \\"they responded quickly with our requests to stop using our Twelfth Man trademark.\\"[82] Texas A&M sent requests to stop using the phrase to the Seattle Seahawks in both 2004 and 2005. The Seahawks did not respond to the requests.[83]\\r\\nIn January 2006, Texas A&M filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Seattle Seahawks and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. Neither side admitted any fault or liability. In the agreement, the Seahawks licensed the phrase in exchange for $100,000, along with public acknowledgement as to Texas A&M's ownership rights of the phrase, and an additional annual fee.[84] The compensation amounted to $5,000 per year.[85][86] The agreement, which expired in 2016, limited the Seahawks' usage to seven western states and forbid them from selling any \\"12th Man\\" merchandise.[85] In August 2015, the Seahawks shifted towards calling their fans the \\"12s\\", and replaced their \\"Home of the 12th Man\\" stadium sign with a new \\"Home of the 12s\\" sign.[87]\\r\\nOn November 12, 2015, Texas A&M filed suit against the Indianapolis Colts after repeated cease and desist requests were ignored by the NFL club.[88] On February 17, 2016, the lawsuit was settled with the Colts agreeing to remove the phrase from their Ring of Honor and to immediately cease all other uses of the trademarked phrase.[39]\\r\\nIn August 2016, the Seahawks agreed to a new five year trademark licensing agreement with Texas A&M. As part of the agreement, the Seahawks agreed to pay Texas A&M $140,000 for limited rights to use the trademarked term. This agreement, like the previous agreement, prohibits the Seahawks from using the \\"12th Man\\" term on any merchandise. The new agreement, however, also prohibits Seattle from using the term on social media, nor are they allowed to use the term on any signage within their stadium, including their Ring of Honor.[89]","input":"What is the 12th man in texas a&m?"},{"output":"Over 27,000","context":"Over 27,000 Australians were killed and 23,000 wounded in action during World War II.

Ohio's swallowtail flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's triangular canton is suggestive of the state's name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag was designed in 1901 by John Eisenmann for the Pan-American Exposition and adopted in 1902. Before that, for nearly a century after statehood, Ohio did not have a legally authorized state flag. One unsuccessful proposal called for a design based on the state seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOhio has adopted an official salute to the flag and the official folding procedure gives it 17 folds. The Ohio flag has influenced a number of logos and municipal flags within the state. A scarlet-colored gubernatorial flag is based on the state seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ohio state flag's design is defined in the Ohio Revised Code, section 5.01:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag of the state shall be burgee-shaped. It shall have three red and two white horizontal stripes that represent the roads and waterways of the state. The union of the flag shall be seventeen five-pointed stars, white in a blue triangular field that represents the state's hills and valleys, the base of which shall be the staff end or vertical edge of the flag, and the apex of which shall be the center of the middle red stripe. The stars shall be grouped around a red disc superimposed upon a white circular \\"O.\\" The thirteen stars grouped around the \\"O\\" represent the original states of the United States and the four stars added to the peak of the triangle symbolize that Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the union. The \\"O\\" represents the \\"O\\" in \\"Ohio\\" and suggests the state's nickname, the buckeye state. The proportional dimensions of the flag and of its various parts shall be according to the official design on file in the office of the secretary of state.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to resembling the letter O and a buckeye nut, the flag's annulus also represents \\"the original territory of Ohio\\" in the Northwest Territory.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOhio's flag is the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. It is a rare example of a non-quadrilateral civil flag, another well-known example being the flag of Nepal. According to vexillologist Whitney Smith, it may be loosely based upon cavalry flags of the Civil War and SpanishÿAmerican War.[3][4] The flag has been officially defined as a \\"burgee\\" since 2002,[5][6] even though burgees are typically used as maritime flags. Its shape, lack of text, and mirror symmetry allow it to be flown or hung in various orientations without affecting legibility.[7] On account of the flag's uncommon shape, foreign manufacturers have occasionally set the entire design against a white, rectangular field.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nearly a century after statehood, Ohio had no legally authorized state flag. The state militia carried regimental colors based on the Stars and Stripes, with the addition of \\"a large eagle, with the number of the regiment and the prescribed number of stars above\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 1850s, Ohio expressed interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place.[11] Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, Cleveland architect John Eisenmann was commissioned to design an exhibition hall for his state at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He developed a distinctive flag to fly over each corner of the Ohio Building.[5] The wool flags officially represented the Ohio Pan-American Exposition Commission rather than the state. On July 18, Governor George K. Nash visited the exposition, where he was presented with one of the flags,[3] which is now held in the Ohio History Connection collections.[13] Eisenmann secured a U.S. design patent for his design, which he described as \\"a triangular forked or swallow-tailed flag corresponding to the shape generally known as a 'cavalry-guidon' or 'broad pennant.'\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1902, State Representative William S. McKinnon, a member of the Ohio Pan-American Exposition Commission, introduced House Bill 213 designating Eisenmann's design as the official flag. It became law on May 9,[15] making it the 20th U.S. state flag or banner.[3] (Eisenmann had assigned his patent, which had a term of three and a half years, to the State of Ohio on April 24.[16])\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Eisenmann's design deviated from the \\"seal on a bedsheet\\" design then nearly universal among state flags, the press looked overseas for precedents: the layout was likened to either the flag of Cuba[17] or of the Philippines,[18] while the red and white annulus was derided for its similarity to the sun on the Japanese flag.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Ohio's flag was seldom used, in part due to the prevailing opinion that the Stars and Stripes should hold a monopoly on patriotic displays. Similar sentiment hindered the adoption of municipal flags in Cleveland and Cincinnati, to the extent that both were downplayed as mere \\"banners\\" for promotional purposes.[3][19] In 1903, it was reported that, among state politicians, only Governor Nash displayed the guidon.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the century following its adoption, the guidon gained significant popularity, being flown not only by the state but frequently also by its residents and businesses.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, the Ohio General Assembly commemorated the 100th anniversary of the state flag's adoption by adopting a salute to the flag, to be recited after the Pledge of Allegiance:\\r\\n\\r\\nI salute the flag of the state of Ohio and pledge to the Buckeye State respect and loyalty.\\r\\nA method of folding the flag of Ohio was created by Alex Weinstock, a Boy Scout from Junction City,[5] for his Eagle Scout service project. It requires two people. The procedure was passed by the 125th Ohio General Assembly as House Bill 552 and signed into law by Governor Bob Taft on February 15, 2005:[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general assembly hereby establishes a recommended procedure for the folding of the state flag by two people. The procedure is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the flag unfolded, fold the flag in half lengthwise so that the points of the flag are aligned. Fold the flag in half lengthwise a second time to form a long strip with the red disc facing the ground. Next, fold the pointed end back onto itself to form a rectangle. These steps entail three folds.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting on the end formed by the fold of the pointed end back onto itself, fold two inches of the flag onto itself for a flag with a three-foot hoist and a five-foot fly, or another appropriate width of fold for a flag of a different size. Repeat the folds a total of fourteen times, alternating the folds in a fan-like manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is a total of seventeen folds symbolizing that Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the Union. Finally, neatly and snugly wrap the remaining length of flag around the fan-folds to form a compact rectangle.\\r\\nOhio is not the only state that has designated a folding procedure for its flag;[21] however, Ohio's procedure takes on special importance due to the flag's irregular shape. A flag vendor in Arkansas has described the procedure as \\"quite a challenge\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOhio's flag is regularly flown during football games by The Ohio State University Marching Band's \\"JI-Row\\" as the percussion section's row mascot.[23] The Columbus Blue Jackets logo[24] and Cincinnati Bengals fan flag[25] are both based on the state flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of municipalities and counties in Ohio have adopted pennants and swallowtails based on the state burgee. The city of Mentor and Adams County have flags that essentially replace the annulus with a seal and modify the pattern of stars in the triangular union.[3][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag of the Governor of Ohio consists of the Great Seal of Ohio encircled with 13 white stars on a scarlet field, with a five-point star in each corner. Like the state flag, it has 17 stars in total.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Adjutant General's office adopted this design in 1905 to represent the Governor on official occasions.[28][29] One such flag hangs in the Rutherford B. Hayes Center Library, a memorial to the 32nd Ohio Governor and 19th U.S. President.[30] The design was officially recognized by the 96th General Assembly effective October 3, 1945:[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt shall have a white star in each of the four corners on an oblong scarlet background with the official seal of the state of Ohio in the center surrounded by thirteen white stars. The proportional dimensions of the flag and of its various parts shall be according to a design approved by the adjutant general and in accordance with the governor's flag used by the adjutant general's office for over thirty years.\\r\\nSince September 30, 1963, the flag has been defined in greater detail:[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag of the governor of this state will be of scarlet wool bunting, six feet eight inches hoist by ten feet six inches fly. In each of the four corners will be a white five-pointed star with one point upward. The centers of these stars will be twelve inches from the long edges and seventeen inches from the short edges of the flag. In the center of the flag will be a reproduction of the great seal of Ohio in proper colors, three feet in diameter, surrounded by thirteen white stars equally spaced with their centers on an imaginary circle four feet three inches in diameter. All stars shall be of such size that their points would lie on the circumference of an imaginary circle ten inches in diameter.\\r\\nThe Ohio Revised Code also specifies smaller versions of this design to be used as the governor's naval flag and automobile flag.","input":"How many stars are on the ohio state flag?"},{"output":"Ross William Ulbricht","context":"Ross William Ulbricht (born March 27, 1984) is an American former drug trafficker and darknet market operator, best known for creating and running the Silk Road website from 2011 until his arrest in 2013.[2] He was known under the pseudonym \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\".\\r\\nUlbricht was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics in February 2015.[3] He is currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.[4] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the conviction and sentence in 2017.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUlbricht grew up in the Austin metropolitan area. He was a Boy Scout,[6] attaining the rank of Eagle Scout.[7] He attended West Ridge Middle School,[8] and Westlake High School, both near Austin. He graduated from high school in 2002.[9]\\r\\nHe attended the University of Texas at Dallas on a full academic scholarship,[7] and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in physics.[9] He then attended Pennsylvania State University, where he was in a master's degree program in materials science and engineering and studied crystallography. By the time Ulbricht graduated he had become more interested in libertarian economic theory. In particular, Ulbricht adhered to the political philosophy of Ludwig von Mises and supported Ron Paul, and participated in college debates to discuss his economic views.[8][10]\\r\\nUlbricht graduated from Penn State in 2009 and returned to Austin. By this time Ulbricht, finding regular employment unsatisfying, wanted to become an entrepreneur, but his first attempts to start his own business failed. He had tried day trading and starting a video game company. His mother claims it was the latter that his LinkedIn profile was referring to when it stated, \\"I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force,\\" claiming it to be a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.[11]:7:20 He eventually partnered with his friend Donny Palmertree to help build an online used book seller, Good Wagon Books. His limited business success, combined with a breakup with his on-and-off girlfriend from Penn State, left Ulbricht discontented.[8][12]\\r\\nAs early as 2009 Ulbricht had been contemplating the idea of building an online black market that would use Tor and bitcoin to evade law enforcement.[13] Tor is a protocol that encrypts data and routes internet traffic through intermediary servers that anonymize IP addresses before reaching a final destination. By hosting his market as a Tor site, Ulbricht could conceal its IP address.[12][14] Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency; while all bitcoin transactions are recorded in a log, the blockchain, if users can avoid linking their identities to their online \\"wallets\\" they can conduct transactions with considerable anonymity.[15][16]\\r\\nUlbricht used the Dread Pirate Roberts login for Silk Road. However, it is disputed that he was the only one to use that account.[11][17][18] Dread Pirate Roberts attributed his inspiration for creating the Silk Road marketplace as \\"Alongside Night and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.\\"[19]\\r\\nUlbricht began to work on developing his online marketplace in 2010 as a side project to Good Wagon Books. He also sporadically kept a diary during the operating history of Silk Road; in his first entry he outlined his situation prior to launch, and predicted he would make 2011 \\"a year of prosperity\\" through his ventures.[8][20] Ulbricht may also have included a reference to Silk Road on his LinkedIn page, where he discussed his wish to \\"use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind\\" and claimed \\"I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.\\"[10] To author Nathaniel Popper, the creation of Silk Road was an act of \\"sheer desperation\\" after Ulbricht exhausted most of the nest egg he had after college on his failed businesses.[15] Ulbricht moved to San Francisco prior to his arrest.[10]\\r\\nUlbricht was first connected to \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\" by Gary Alford, an IRS investigator working with the DEA on the Silk Road case, in mid-2013.[21][22] The connection was made by linking the username \\"altoid\\", used during Silk Road's early days to announce the website, and a forum post in which Ulbricht, posting under the nickname \\"altoid\\", asked for programming help and gave his email address, which contained his full name. [23] In October 2013, Ulbricht was arrested by the FBI while at the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco Public Library, and accused of being the \\"mastermind\\" behind the site.[24][25][25][26]\\r\\nTo prevent Ulbricht from encrypting or deleting data on the laptop he was using to run the site as he was arrested, two agents pretended to be quarreling lovers. When they had sufficiently distracted him,[27] a third agent took his computer away,[28] and inserted a USB flash drive that cloned all the data on the hard drive.[27] Agent Chris Tarbell presented Ulbricht the warrant for his arrest.[28]\\r\\nUlbricht was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics,[25][29] and procuring murder.[26] The charge of procuring murder was removed from the indictment[30] although the evidence was factored into Ulbricht's sentence.[31] Ulbricht was convicted of all the remaining charges after a jury trial that concluded in February 2015.[32] He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on 29 May 2015.[33][34][35]\\r\\nThe prosecutor believed that none of the six contracted murders-for-hire occurred.[26] One charge of procuring murder is to be dealt with in a separate pending trial in Maryland;[36] the other five were never filed.[37]\\r\\nHis lawyers submitted an appeal on 12 January 2016, centered on claims that the prosecution illegally withheld evidence of DEA agents' malfeasance in the investigation of Silk Road, for which they were convicted.[38] The oral hearing for the appeal was 6 October 2016.[39] On May 31, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Ulbricht's appeal and affirmed the judgment of conviction and life sentence in an opinion written by Gerard E. Lynch, United States Circuit Judge.[40] Ulbricht, as well as arguing that the corruption of two federal agents should be considered, also argued his sentence was too harsh.[41]\\r\\nOn 22 December 2017, Ulbricht filed his final appeal with the United States Supreme Court.[42] His appeal argues two key issues: (1) \\"Whether the warrantless seizure of an individuals Internet traffic information without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment;\\" and, (2) \\"Whether the Sixth Amendment permits judges to find the facts necessary to support an otherwise unreasonable sentence.\\"[43]\\r\\nOn 5 February 2018, five organizations filed amicus curiae briefs in support of Ulbricht: the National Lawyers Guild, American Black Cross, Reason Foundation, Drug Policy Alliance, and Downsize DC Foundation.[44]\\r\\nOn 7 March 2018, the U.S. government filed a response to Ulbricht's petition.[44] The government argues that a decision on the first issue of his appeal should be postponed until a decision is granted in Carpenter v.

The government suggested outright dismissal of the second issue, citing a lack of supporting precedent as well as noting that the Sixth Amendment claim was not raised prior to filing the petition.[45]\\r\\nAt the start of his sentence he was incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York.[34] As of September 2017, he is held at USP Florence High.[46][47][11]","input":"Who was the creator of the silk road?"},{"output":"World War II","context":"World War II was the first war in which jet aircraft participated in combat with examples being used on both sides of the conflict during the latter stages of the war.

The single peaked at #32 in June 1980, becoming his final Top Forty charting hit. It was also an Adult Contemporary hit, reaching #10 in the US[1] and #2 in Canada.[2] The song made a minor showing in the UK (#59), however, recharted several years later and reached #4 in 1986.

Notably, the phrase \\"A-number-one\\", which does not appear at all in the original lyrics, is sung twice at the song's rallentando climax. (Ebb has said he \\"didn't even like\\" Sinatra's use of \\"A-number-one\\").[3] The phrase is both the first and fourth on a list of three superlative titles the singer strives to achieve  \\"A-number-one, top of the list, king of the hill, A-number-one\\"  where Ebb's original lyrics (performed by Minnelli) were \\"king of the hill, head of the list, cream of the crop, at the top of the heap.\\"\\r\\nDespite Sinatra's version becoming more familiar, original singer Minnelli had two of the tune's most memorable live performances ÿ during the July 4, 1986 ceremony marking the rededication of the Statue of Liberty after extensive renovations, and in the middle of the seventh inning of a New York Mets game, that was the first pro sports event in the metro area after the September 11, 2001 attacks. She also sang it in the Olympic stadium during the 1984 Summer Olympics, accompanied by 24 pianos and strobe lights.\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nThe song has been embraced as a celebration of New York City, and is often heard at New York-area social events, such as weddings and bar mitzvahs. Many sports teams in the New York area have played this song in their arenas/stadiums, but the New York Yankees are the most prominent example. It has been played over the loudspeakers at both the original and current Yankee Stadiums at the end of every Yankee home game since July 1980. Originally, Sinatra's version was played after a Yankees win, and the Minnelli version after a loss.[5] However, due to a complaint from Minnelli, the Sinatra version is now heard regardless of the game's outcome.[6] As of the 2005 season, at the Richmond County Bank Ballpark following Staten Island Yankees games, the Sinatra version is heard regardless of the game's outcome, and was formerly done at Shea Stadium at the end of New York Mets games after the September 11, 2001 attack. Previously, Mets fans felt it was a \\"Yankee song\\", and began booing it when it was played. It actually first had snippets of the song played after World Series home runs by Ray Knight and Darryl Strawberry during Game 7 of the 1986 World Series. The song is also sometimes played at New York Knicks games. The Sinatra version is played at the end of every New York Rangers game at Madison Square Garden. It was played at the opening faceoff of Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals at the Garden.[7] The song has also been the post parade song for the Belmont Stakes from 1997 to 2009,[8] and again from 2011 to the present.[9] Sinatra's version of the song has been played at the end of all four Super Bowls that the New York Giants have won to date, as well as before kickoff of Super Bowl XLVIII, while Minnelli's version was heard after the Giants' Super Bowl XXXV loss.\\r\\nThe song was the musical basis for Jimmy Picker's 1983 three-minute animated short, Sundae in New York, which won the Academy Award for Best Short Film (Animated) that year, with a likeness of then-mayor Ed Koch somewhat stumbling through the song, with clay caricatures of New York-based celebrities (including Alfred E. Neuman) and finishing the song with \\"Basically I think New York is very therapeutic. Hey, an apple a day is...uh...great for one's constitution!\\" and burying his face in a big banana split with \\"THE END\\" written on his bald head. (Koch used the same rallentando climax Sinatra used, albeit with one big difference: \\"A-number one, top of the list, king of the hill...\\" followed by his impression of Groucho Marx completing, \\"...and incidentally a heckuva nice guy!\\")[10]\\r\\nAn instrumental version of the song is used as the main theme music for NBC's broadcasts of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. It is also played during the annual Times Square New Year's Day celebrations, immediately after \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" and the ball drop.[11]\\r\\nQueen covered the song for the 1986 fantasy film Highlander. Unlike the other songs recorded for the film, it has never appeared on a Queen album.\\r\\nThe song is performed by Brain Gremlin in the 1990 sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch.\\r\\nIn Arrested Development episode 8 of season 2, which aired in January 2005, Tobias, played by David Cross, starts singing the song in his newly bought club. Lucille 2, played by Liza Minnelli, who's in the audience comments \\"Everyone thinks they're Frank Sinatra.\\"\\r\\nIn DreamWorks' Madagascar (2005), the song is introduced in Central Park Zoo, and Marty later sings the song in the midst of Alex the Lion's delirium.[12]\\r\\nThe song can be heard in the pilot episode of Blue Bloods which aired September 24, 2010.\\r\\nIn 2013, the song was played at the funeral of former New York City Mayor Ed Koch. [13]\\r\\nIn the 2015 James Bond film Spectre, the instrumental introduction of the song was played inside the Aston Martin DB10 for a few seconds, when Bond presses one of the control buttons during a car chase scene in Rome.","input":"Who sang the song new york new york first?"},{"output":"Rogue attacks Ms. Marvel","context":"","input":"How did rogue get ms marvel's powers?"},{"output":"model year 1999","context":"The Honda Odyssey is a minivan manufactured and marketed by Japanese automaker Honda since 1994, now in its fifth generation.\\r\\nThe Odyssey had originally been conceived and engineered in Japan, in the wake of the country's economic crisis of the 1990s ÿ which in turn imposed severe constraints on the vehicle's size and overall concept, dictating the minivan's manufacture in an existing facility with minimal modification.[1] The result was a smaller minivan, in the Compact MPV class, that was well received in the Japanese domestic market[1] and less well received in North America.[2] The first generation Odyssey was marketed in Europe as the Shuttle.\\r\\nSubsequent generations diverged to reflect market variations, and Honda built a plant in Lincoln, Alabama, incorporating the ability to manufacture larger models.[2] Since model year 1999, Honda has marketed a larger (large MPV-class) Odyssey in North America and a smaller Odyssey in Japan and other markets. Honda also offered the larger North American Odyssey in Japan as the Honda LaGreat beginning in June 1999 through 2005. Both versions of the Odyssey were sold in Japan at Honda Clio dealership locations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Odyssey was introduced in 1994 as Honda's first minivan[3]  based on the Accord platform, with a 4-cylinder engine, all-disc anti-lock braking, all wishbone suspension, and a four-speed automatic transmission with a steering-column-mounted shifter and a hill-hold feature, marketed as Grade Logic.[3] The design featured unibody construction,[4] dual airbags, dual gloveboxes, dual zone heating and cooling with 20 percent greater capacity than an Accord's system[4] (overhead rear fan-speed adjustment control, and main control switch over the front-seat passenger), conventional rear swing-open rather than sliding doors, and a third row seat that could fold and tumble into a compartment beneath the floor  the spacesaver spare tire carried inside, on the right, rear wall of the cabin.[3]\\r\\nHonda marketed the first generation Odyssey in two trim levels. The LX accommodated seven passengers with two front buckets, a removable three-seat middle bench, and a 2-seat third row bench. The EX accommodated six passengers (using two removable second row captain's chairs in lieu of the bench) and offered additional equipment including a roof rack, alloy wheels, power driver's seat height adjustment, power sunroof, remote keyless entry system, fog lights (later model years), body-colored side moldings and mirrors, map lights, and 20-watt AM/FM/cassette six-speaker audio system.\\r\\nIsuzu offered a rebadged version of the Odyssey from 1996ÿ1999 as the Isuzu Oasis.\\r\\nThe Odyssey was engineered by Kunimichi Odagaki, then a chief engineer at the Honda's Research and Development Center, along with a team of 20 members[1]  in the wake of Japans recession of the early 1990s and the possibility of a 25-percent tariffs if the minivans were imported to the U.S. as light trucks.[1] In the course of developing the Odyssey, it became paramount to circumvent these obstacles and conceive a feasible interior package that could use existing manufacturing facilities with minimal investment.[1]\\r\\nOdagaki traveled to the U.S. in September 1990 with a small sub-team to conduct a review of the U.S. minivan market.[1] At the project's inception, the team was considering variations for the project from 4-cylinder to V6 alternatives, when the project was canceled.\\r\\nOdagaki continued working with an \\"underground\\" team, using as its design credo the concept of a \\"personal jet\\"[1]  which in turn led to the car's original PJ concept code-name.[5] Odagaki conceived the idea of the third row seat folding into a floor compartment, and he worked with his team to include a \\"center aisle.\\" The team determined a minimum interior height of 1.2 meters to retain the aisle, and favored a design with a low floor  to provide ease of passenger entry and exit, easy garage-ability, low roof-loading height, as well as enhanced productivity on the assembly line.[1]\\r\\nThe team worked to convince management of the project's viability, using extensive illustrations, a one-quarter scale model and a full-size foam model.[1] By April 1991, Odagaki won permission to develop a prototype.[1]\\r\\nAfter bringing the right-hand drive prototype to the U.S., Odagaki won the support of American Honda. Production was officially launched on October 20, 1994  the first Honda model in to be released at the same time through Honda's three Japanese distribution channels (Primo, Clio, Verno), marketing the Odyssey through the three channels under the same name.[1]\\r\\nAt its debut, the Odyssey won the Japan Car of the Year Award (Special Category) and the RJC New Car of the Year Award. By September 1997, the Odyssey had sold more than 300,000 units, becoming Hondas fastest-selling new car and breaking the Civics record.[1]\\r\\nIn 1996, New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) expanded the number of licensable automobiles, approving the first generation Odyssey for use in the city's taxi fleet[6]  the Odyssey having been recommended by the seven-year-old grandson of a TLC advisory commission member.[7] Initial test riders identified advantages over then-prevalent Chevrolet Caprice and the Ford Crown Victoria taxi models  including greater height (for a better view of the road), headroom, rear legroom, rear footroom (the front-wheel-drive Odyssey having a flat floor) and cargo space over the sedans, as well as air-conditioning vents in the rear, which the sedans did not offer. [8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation North American market Odyssey was first assembled in Canada as a 1999 model mainly for North America  and marketed in Japan as the LaGreat between 1999 and 2005.[9] The television ad campaign for the new Odyssey evoked moments from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, particularly the extended space-station docking and lunar landing sequences to the soundtrack of The Blue Danube waltz.\\r\\nBy its second generation, the Odyssey was considerably larger than its predecessor, and adopted the Chrysler style minivan format, with sliding rear doors instead of hinged ones, simpler front strut suspension in place of upper and lower control arm front suspension of the 1995-1998 model and a 210 horsepower (160?kW) V6 engine instead of the original, four-cylinder. The Odyssey offered two sliding doors as standard equipment, whereas some minivans of the time only offered one, a second door being optional. The Odyssey offered power sliding doors which were standard on the EX trims, but not available on the LX trims. The Odyssey kept the fold-into-the-floor rear seat, an innovation adopted by many other minivans. The van continued to receive upgrades, such as offering both VHS and DVD-based entertainment systems. There was also an available Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System, introduced during 1999, which became the first navigation system ever offered in a minivan.\\r\\nThe 2004 model was the only second generation Odyssey model year to receive reliability ratings of five out of five according to Automotive Information Systems.[citation needed] IIHS gave the Odyssey a Good rating in the Frontal Offset Test in years 1999-2004.[10]\\r\\nThe second generation was praised for its powerful V6, its handling from its four-wheel independent suspension, and its features such as a large cabin, power sliding doors (manual sliding doors on LX models) and the stow-away third-row seat. Some found it noisier than competitors. It won consecutive Edmunds.com Editors' Most Wanted awards from 1999ÿ2003 in the minivan category.[11]\\r\\nThis is also the only generation of the Honda Odyssey where the power windows are only on the driver's and front passenger's doors.\\r\\nThe Odyssey also received a significant increase in power from 210?hp (157?kW) to 240?hp (179?kW) during 2001. Also added was a five-speed automatic transmission, side torso airbags (not side curtain airbags), rear disc brakes, and a few minor cosmetic improvements on the outside as well as the inside. Other than an AUTO power driver's window, the Odyssey remained unchanged for 2003 and 2004, before being replaced with the third-generation model.\\r\\nThe 4-speed automatic transmission in 1999 to 2001 models had serious problems with transmission durability. Honda spokesman Mike Spencer stated that four-speed models were afflicted with a bad bearing that could break apart, scattering fragments of metal that clogged fluid passageways in the transmission, causing it to shift erratically.[12] Honda responded to the problems by extending the warranty on the transmission on American 1999-2001 models to 7 years or 100,000 miles (160,900?km). A class action settlement further extended coverage to 109,000 miles (175,400?km) or 93 months for some 1999-2001 Odysseys in the US.[13] Canada is not included. The five-speed automatic was first installed in the Odyssey for the 2002 model, but general reliability of the 1999-2003 transmission was poor according to Consumer Reports. Mike Spencer, a spokesman for Honda, said that the five-speed models typically were damaged by premature wear of the third-gear clutch pack. As the clutch friction material abraded, it scattered bits inside the transmission case, clogging fluid lines and causing erratic shifting. Drivers might suffer slipping, poor or no shifts, or sudden down-shifts from 5th gear to 2nd gear.[12]\\r\\nUnder some conditions, a different 5-speed transmission problem arose. Second gear could overheat and break, causing the transmission to lock. An oil jet was added to lubricate this gear but this did not solve the third gear clutch problem.[14] The addition of the Honda transmission cooler with the towing package still allows transmission fluid temperatures that are too high. But it was required along with a power steering cooler for any towing, or the warranty would be void. The Acura CL, TL, MDX and Honda Accord suffered similar problems.\\r\\n \\r\\nHonda introduced the third-generation Odyssey for the 2005 model year. It grew in width and weight but retained the previous generation's length and interior space.\\r\\nHonda introduced the ACE body engineering to the third-generation Odyssey, which was later used on the eighth generation Civic. Side-curtain airbags and electronic stability control are included in all models. Both features were previously unavailable.\\r\\nAdditional features included integrated sunshades in the rear doors, windows that roll down in the second row, and the third row 'Magic Seat' was changed from a straight bench design to a split 60/40 design to allow for variable folding. The headrests could now be left in place when tumbling the rear seat. Some notable features of the redesign were dual glove boxes and an in-floor lazy susan storage compartment, located in the previous generation's spare tire well. Third generation models offered a dashboard-mounted shifter, instead of a column-mounted shifter. The second row bucket seats do not fold into the floor. A 'Plus-One' jump seat was standard on EX and EX-L trims for use with an eighth passenger. Touring models came with a center storage compartment.[15]\\r\\nEngine power was increased to 255 (re rated to 244 by the new SAE J1349 guidelines, and used in 2006+ model descriptions) and EX-L and Touring models received Honda's VCM, or Variable Cylinder Management system. This enabled this van to receive U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel economy ratings of 20?mpg?US (12?L/100?km; 24?mpg?imp)/28?mpg?US (8.4?L/100?km; 34?mpg?imp) for the 2005 model year. (19?mpg?US (12?L/100?km; 23?mpg?imp)/25?mpg?US (9.4?L/100?km; 30?mpg?imp) for non VCM equipped LX and EX models.)<[16] These numbers were re-rated in 2007, bringing numbers to 17/25 for VCM equipped models, and 16/23 for non VCM equipped models.[17] Acceleration was slightly slower than generation two models. It was rated top pick in minivan category in Consumer Reports 2005 Annual auto issue.\\r\\nThe EX-L and higher trims could be purchased with both navigation and rear entertainment systems, or rear entertainment system only, while the VHS-based i-VES system was dropped. Four trim levels were available in the United States: LX, EX, EX-L, and Touring, the top-of-the-line package in the Odyssey lineup that incorporated features such as run-flat tires, power tailgate, power adjustable pedals, multi information display, memory seats and chrome tailgate trim.\\r\\nProblem areas included body integrity, which includes paint wear and rusting issues, body hardware bumpers being loose, audio system, brakes and suspension according to the Consumer Reports issue of April 2006. According to the online edition of Consumer Reports in June 2016, transmission problems were better than average for 2006 models. Crash test ratings have been five star in every test but the 2005 had a safety concern. \\"During the side impact test, the driver door became unlatched and opened. A door opening during a side impact crash increases the likelihood of occupant ejection.\\"[18] Odyssey has won a spot on Car and Driver's 5 Best trucks for the past three years, as well as a host of other awards. The Odyssey is the top-ranked minivan in the US News charts.[19] The 2007-09 Odyssey was the best-selling minivan in the United States.[20]\\r\\nFor 2008, the Odyssey received a mid-model facelift. All models were equipped with active front head restraints, daytime running lights, redesigned dashboard, grille and taillights. An audio AUX jack became standard equipment. The backup camera, previously only included with navigation-equipped models, was integrated into the rear-view mirror of the non-navigation EX-L. Touring models featured full Bluetooth support for all Bluetooth-equipped devices, and are now standard with navigation. EX, EX-L, and Touring models came standard with the updated 'Plus One' jump seat with added storage features.\\r\\nIn Canada, an entry-level DX trim was added to the LX, EX, EX-L, and Touring packages for the 2008-2010 model years. The DX lacks features such as the \\"2nd-Row Plus One Seat with storage\\", conversation mirror with sunglasses holder, tinted glass, roof rails, and has black body moldings. The LX trim level was dropped for the 2010 model year, which also saw a SE Odyssey NHL edition replace the EX (being identical to the 2008-09 EX in all respects but with a rear entertainment system and NHL badges). For the 2010 model year, the DVD rear entertainment system is now available on the EX-L trim and while it is still standard on the Touring.\\r\\nHonda presented the 2011 Odyssey Concept in early 2010 at the Chicago Auto Show and officially on June 17; with a larger, wider body, a lower roofline and revised styling. A Touring Elite model became available.\\r\\nCompared to its predecessor, the fourth generation Honda Odyssey is 0.8?in (20?mm) longer, 2.1?in (53?mm) wider and 0.4?in (10?mm) - 0.6?in (15?mm) lower. The body is constructed using 59% high strength steel, ranging from 390-1,500 MPa yield strength. Available trim levels initially included the LX, EX, EX-L, Touring and Touring Elite.\\r\\nThe fourth generation Odyssey introduced options including 12-speaker 650 watt audio system (Touring Elite), a voice-controlled satellite GPS and HDD navigation system with XM NavTraffic (Touring and above, available EX-L), an external HDMI input (Touring Elite),[21] a larger 16.2-inch (410?mm) split-screen rear-seat DVD entertainment system (Touring Elite), a \\"cool box\\" chilled by the air conditioning (EX-L and above), a stowable 3rd row 60/40 split bench seat, a removable first row center console (EX and above), and a new steering wheel via updates.[22][23]\\r\\nThe fourth generation Odyssey includes projector headlamps or HID xenon low-beam headlamps (Touring Elite), standard 17-inch wheels, 18-inch alloy wheels (Touring and above), and 6-speed automatic transmission (Touring and above). A Blind Spot Display for the driver's side and a tri-angle backup camera are available.[24]\\r\\nFor the 2014 model year, Honda facelifted the Odyssey. Changes included a 6-speed automatic transmission on all trims, sleeker exterior styling with a new aluminum hood, aluminum front fenders, twin-bar grille and revised lower front fascia with integrated fog lights, darker-finish projector headlight housings, Smart entry availability and LED rear taillight bars. A built-in vacuum cleaner system is included with the Touring Elite model.\\r\\nHonda's i-MID, also available on the Civic and Accord, became standard equipment in 2014 models; all models now got standard Pandora Internet Radio capabilities, Bluetooth Hands-Free Link, iPod, iPhone, and USB integration, and a color display screen.\\r\\nNew safety features included in the refresh include a LaneWatch camera housed in the passenger side-view mirror which may be paired to the driver's side Blind Spot Display system. Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) are also available while a single-angle backup camera with dynamic guidelines became standard equipment.\\r\\nThe models for 2014 include the LX, the EX, the EX w/ Leather (EX-L), the Touring, and the Touring Elite. The SE trim positioned between LX and EX, was initially limited to the Canadian market, but is available in the US as of the 2016 model year. New exterior paint colors were made available in 2014, as are new interior fabrics and trim pieces.\\r\\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found the Odyssey to have the lowest overall driver death rate in its class with 0 deaths per million registered years.[25][26] Beginning with the 2013 model year all Odysseys came equipped with a rear-view backup camera.[27] For 2014 the front crash structure was upgraded.[28]\\r\\nThe fifth generation Odyssey was unveiled at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in January.[31] Sales began on May 25, 2017 as a 2018 model. A 10-speed automatic (Touring and Elite trim levels) produced at Honda Precision Parts Georgia (HPPG) is Honda's first use of a 10-speed transmission in a production automobile.\\r\\nAt its debut, the Odyssey won the Japan Car of the Year Award (Special Category) and the RJC New Car of the Year Award. By September 1997, the Odyssey had sold more than 300,000 units, becoming Hondas fastest-selling new car and breaking the Civics record.[1] The Odyssey was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1995.[11] At the Odyssey's European launch, where it was marketed as the Shuttle, British ex-Grand Prix driver Jonathan Palmer described its handling as equal of any \\"executive sedan\\".[5]\\r\\nIn a 1995 owner survey, 98% of the respondents rated the Odyssey's handling as above average, 50.3 percent rating engine power to be good  and 25 percent wanted a more powerful engine.[4] A later review of the first generation Odyssey summarized the minivan's market reception:\\r\\nThe Odyssey has received numerous awards since its inception, winning both Car and Driver's \\"5 Best Trucks\\" and Consumer Reports' \\"Top Pick Minivan\\" several times.[32]\\r\\nIn the middle of 2012, Honda began exporting the new Odyssey minivan to the Philippines. Export of the Odyssey to that market ceased after the introduction of the international fifth-generation Odyssey.\\r\\nA version of the second generation North American Odyssey was sold in Japan as the LaGreat.\\r\\nThe Odyssey manufactured at HMA in Alabama has also been exported to Canada, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, and South Korea.","input":"What year did honda odyssey change body style?"},{"output":"April 15, 1955","context":"This history of McDonald's is an overview of the original restaurant and of the chain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe McDonald family moved from Manchester, New Hampshire to Hollywood in the late 1930s, where brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald began working as set movers and handymen at Motion-Picture studios.[1] In 1937, their father Patrick McDonald opened \\"The Airdrome\\", a food stand, on Huntington Drive (Route 66) near the Monrovia Airport in Monrovia, California[2] with hot dogs being one of the first items sold. Hamburgers were later added to the menu at a cost of ten cents with all-you-can-drink orange juice at five cents. In 1940, Maurice and Richard (\\"Mac\\" and \\"Dick\\") moved the entire building 40 miles (64?km) east, to West 14th and 1398 North E Streets in San Bernardino, California. The restaurant was renamed \\"McDonald's Bar-B-Que\\" and had 25 menu items, mostly barbecue.\\r\\nIn October 1948, after the McDonald brothers realized that most of their profits came from selling hamburgers, they closed down their successful carhop drive-in to establish a streamlined system with a simple menu which consisted of only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, soft drinks, and apple pie.[3] After the first year, potato chips and pie were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes. The carhops were eliminated, making the new restaurant a self-service operation. Richard and Maurice took great care in setting up their kitchen like an assembly line to ensure maximum efficiency. The restaurant's name was changed again, this time to simply \\"McDonald's,\\" and reopened on December 12, 1948.\\r\\nIn April 1952, the brothers decided they needed an entirely new building in order to achieve two goals: further efficiency improvements, and a more eye-catching appearance. They collected recommendations for an architect and interviewed at least four, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana.[1] The brothers and Meston worked together closely in the design of their new building. They achieved the extra efficiencies they needed by, among other things, drawing the actual measurements of every piece of equipment in chalk on a tennis court behind the McDonald house (with Meston's assistant Charles Fish).[4] The new restaurant's design achieved a high level of noticeability thanks to gleaming surfaces of red and white ceramic tile, stainless steel, brightly colored sheet metal, and glass; pulsing red, white, yellow, and green neon; and two 25-foot yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called \\"golden arches\\" even at the design stage. A third, smaller arch sign at the roadside hosted a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon. Further marketing techniques were implemented to change McDonald's from a sit down restaurant to a fast food chain. They used such things as turning off the heating to prevent people wanting to stay so long, fixed and angled seating so the customer would sit over their food promoting them to eat faster, spreading the seats further apart so being less of a sociable place to dine in, and giving their customers branded cone shaped cups forcing them to hold their drink whilst eating which would speed up the eating process. Many other companies followed McDonald's strategies to turn their own restaurants into fast food establishments including Burger King, White Castle and Subway.[1]\\r\\nIn late 1953, with only a rendering of Meston's design in hand, the brothers began seeking franchisees.[1] Their first franchisee was Neil Fox, a distributor for General Petroleum Corporation. Fox's stand, the first with Meston's golden arches design, opened in May 1953 at Central Avenue and Indian School Road in Phoenix, Arizona. Their second franchisee was the team of Fox's brother-in-law Roger Williams and Burdette \\"Bud\\" Landon, both of whom also worked for General Petroleum. Williams and Landon opened their stand on August 18, 1953 at 10207 Lakewood Boulevard in Downey, California. The Downey stand has the distinction of being the oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant.[5] The Downey stand was never required to comply with the McDonald's Corporation's remodeling and updating requests over the years because it was franchised not by the McDonald's Corporation, but by the McDonald brothers themselves to Williams and Landon.\\r\\nIn 1954, Ray Kroc, a seller of Prince Castle brand Multimixer milkshake machines, learned that the McDonald brothers were using eight of his machines in their San Bernardino restaurant. His curiosity was piqued, and he went to take a look at the restaurant. He was joined by good friend Charles Lewis who had suggested to Kroc several improvements to the McDonald's burger recipe.\\r\\nBelieving the McDonald's formula was a ticket to success, Kroc suggested they franchise their restaurants throughout the country. The brothers were skeptical, however, that the self-service approach could succeed in colder, rainier climates; furthermore, their thriving business in San Bernardino, and franchises already operating or planned, made them reluctant to risk a national venture.[1] Kroc offered to take the major responsibility for setting up the new franchises elsewhere. He returned to his home outside of Chicago with rights to set up McDonald's restaurants throughout the country, except in a handful of territories in California and Arizona already licensed by the McDonald brothers. The brothers were to receive one-half of one percent of gross sales.[1] Kroc's first McDonald's restaurant opened on April 15, 1955, at 400 North Lee Street in Des Plaines, Illinois, near Chicago. The Des Plaines interior and exterior was painted by master painter Eugene Wright, who owned Wright's Decorating Service. Eugene was asked to come up with a color scheme and he chose yellow and white, with dark brown and red being secondary trim colors. Those colors would go on to become the colors of all McDonald's franchises. (Recognizing its historic and nostalgic value, in 1990 the McDonald's Corporation acquired the stand and rehabilitated it to a modern but nearly original condition, and then built an adjacent museum and gift shop to commemorate the site.)\\r\\n Once the Des Plaines restaurant had become operational, Kroc sought franchisees for his McDonald's chain. The first snag came quickly. In 1956 he discovered that the McDonald brothers had licensed the franchise rights for Cook County, Illinois to the Frejlach Ice Cream Company. Kroc was incensed that the McDonalds had not informed him of this arrangement. He purchased the rights back for $25,000, five times what the Frejlacks had originally paid, and pressed forward. McDonald's grew slowly for its first three years. By 1958, there were 34 restaurants. In 1959, however, Kroc opened 68 new restaurants, bringing the total to 102 locations.\\r\\nIn 1960, the McDonald's advertising campaign \\"Look for the Golden Arches\\" gave sales a big boost. Kroc believed that advertising was an investment that would in the end come back many times over, and advertising has always played a key role in the development of the McDonald's Corporation. Indeed, McDonald's ads have been some of the most identifiable over the years. In 1962, McDonald's introduced its now world-famous Golden Arches logo. A year later, the company sold its millionth hamburger and introduced Ronald McDonald, a red-haired clown designed to appeal to children.\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, McDonald's really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization and the interstate highway system contributed heavily to McDonald's success. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million, aiming at making McDonald's the number one fast-food chain in the country.\\r\\nOn May 3, 1960 Kroc assisted Christopher Boulos in opening a McDonald's franchise in DeKalb, Illinois. By 1965, the McDonald's at 805 W. Lincoln Highway sold over 4 million burgers and 1,000,000 pounds (450,000?kg) of fries. Boulos was the first Greek-American McDonald's franchise operator.[6]\\r\\nIn 1965, McDonald's Corporation went public. Common shares were offered at $22.50 per share. By the end of the first day's trading, the price had risen to $30. A block of 100 shares purchased for $2,250 in 1965 was worth, after 12 stock splits (increasing the number of shares to 74,360), over $5.7 million as of year-end market close on December 31, 2010. In 1980, McDonald's Corporation became one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\\r\\nMcDonald's success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company's skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1962, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, billed as \\"the fish that catches people\\", was introduced in McDonald's restaurants.[7] The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a \\"hulaburger\\", had flopped (both it and the Filet-O-Fish were developed in Catholic neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on Fridays and during Lent). The market was not quite ready for Kroc's taste; the hulaburger's tenure on the McDonald's menu board was short. In 1968 the now legendary Big Mac made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald's sold its five billionth hamburger. Two years later, as it launched the \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\" advertising campaign, McDonald's restaurants had reached all 50 states.\\r\\nIn 1968, McDonald's opened its 1,000th restaurant, and Fred L. Turner became the company's president and chief administrative officer. Kroc became chairman and remained CEO until 1973. Turner had originally intended to open a McDonald's franchise, but when he had problems with his backers over a location, he went to work as a grillman for Kroc in 1956. As operations vice president, Turner helped new franchisees get their stores up and running. He was constantly looking for new ways to perfect the McDonald's system, experimenting, for example, to determine the maximum number of hamburger patties one could stack in a box without squashing them and pointing out that seconds could be saved if McDonald's used buns that were presliced all the way through and were not stuck together in the package. Such attention to detail was one reason for the company's extraordinary success.\\r\\nBy the late 1960s, many of the candy-striped Golden Arches stores had been modified with enclosed walk-up order areas and limited indoor seating. In June 1969, McDonald's introduced a new \\"mansard roof\\" building design featuring indoor seating. The natural brick and cedar shake look mansards were a response to critics who berated McDonald's architecture as too garish. It became the standard for McDonald's restaurants, and franchise holders were ultimately required to demolish older restaurants and replace them with the new design. The first McDonald's restaurant using the \\"mansard roof\\" design opened that same year in the Chicago suburb of Matteson.\\r\\nMcDonald's spectacular growth continued in the 1970s. Americans were more on-the-go than ever, and fast service was a priority. In 1972, the company passed $1 billion in annual sales. By 1976, McDonald's had served 20 billion hamburgers, and system wide sales exceeded $3 billion.\\r\\nThe company pioneered breakfast fast food with the introduction of the Egg McMuffin in 1972 when market research indicated that a quick breakfast would be welcomed by consumers. Five years later McDonald's added a full breakfast line to the menu, and by 1987 one-fourth of all breakfasts eaten out in the United States came from McDonald's restaurants. In test market locations, such as New York City, McDonald's added a full breakfast line to its menus in 1975.\\r\\nKroc was a firm believer in giving \\"something back into the community where you do business\\". In 1974 McDonald's acted upon that philosophy in an original way by opening the first Ronald McDonald House, in Philadelphia, to provide a \\"home away from home\\" for the families of children in nearby hospitals. Twelve years after this first house opened, 100 similar Ronald McDonald Houses were in operation across the United States.\\r\\nThere was some skepticism in the company's phenomenal growth internationally. When Wally and Hugh Morris approached the corporation in 1974 to bring McDonald's into New Zealand, they were firmly shunned by Kroc, citing a visit to the country and saying \\"There aren't any people... I never met a more dead-than-alive hole in my life.\\" Persistence by the brothers eventually led to their request being granted in May 1975. They managed to negotiate a deal with the corporation by selling New Zealand cheese to the US to offset the high costs of importing plant equipment. The first New Zealand restaurant opened in June 1976 at Porirua, near Wellington, to much more success than the corporation predicted.[8]\\r\\nIn 1975, McDonald's opened its first drive-thru window in Sierra Vista, Arizona, following Wendy's lead. This service gave Americans a fast, convenient way to procure a quick meal. The company's goal was to provide service in 50 seconds or less. Drive-thru sales eventually accounted for more than half of McDonald's systemwide sales. Meantime, the Happy Meal, a combo meal for children featuring a toy, was added to the menu in 1979. A period of aggressive advertising campaigns and price slashing in the early 1980s became known as the \\"burger wars\\". Burger King suggested to customers: \\"have it your way\\"; Wendy's offered itself as the \\"fresh alternative\\" and launched their \\"Where's the beef?\\" campaign. McDonald's sales and market still predominated, however.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, a period of substantial expansion, McDonald's further diversified its menu to suit changing consumer tastes. The company introduced the McChicken in 1980; it proved to be a sales disappointment, and was replaced with Chicken McNuggets a year later (having originally been invented by Rene Arend in 1979). In 1985, ready-to-eat salads were introduced. Efficiency, combined with an expanded menu, continued to draw customers. McDonald's began to focus on urban centers and introduced new architectural styles.\\r\\nThe first McDonald's Express locations opened in 1991. These are smaller-scale prototypes, usually constructed in prefabricated buildings or urban storefronts, that do not feature certain menu items such as milkshakes and Quarter Pounders.[9]\\r\\nIn 1992 Michael R. Quinlan became president of McDonald's Corporation, and Fred L. Turner became chairman. Quinlan, who took over as CEO in 1987, had started at McDonald's in the mail room in 1963, and gradually worked his way up. In his first year as CEO, the company opened 600 new restaurants.\\r\\nBy 1991, 37 percent of system-wide sales came from restaurants outside the United States. McDonald's opened its first foreign restaurant in British Columbia, Canada, in 1967. By the early 1990s the company had established itself in 58 foreign countries, and operated more than 3,600 restaurants outside the United States, through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and franchise agreements. Its strongest foreign markets were Japan, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and France.\\r\\nIn the mid-1980s, McDonald's, like other traditional employers of teenagers, was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States. The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce. Focusing on off-site training, it opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received \\"Bachelor of Hamburgerology\\" degrees from the 80-acre (320,000?m2) Oak Brook, Illinois, facility. The corporation opened a Hamburger University in Tokyo in 1971, in Munich in 1975, and in London in 1982.\\r\\nBraille menus were first introduced in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992, combination Braille and picture menus were reintroduced to accommodate those with vision, speech, or hearing impairments.\\r\\nClamshell grills, which cooked both sides of a hamburger simultaneously, were tested. New locations such as hospitals and military bases were tapped as sites for new restaurants. In response to the increase in microwave oven usage, McDonald's, whose name is the single most advertised brand name in the world, stepped up advertising and promotional expenditures stressing that its taste was superior to quick-packaged foods.\\r\\nThe first McDonald's in Mainland China opened in Dongmen, Shenzhen in October 1990.[10]\\r\\nMcRecycle USA began in 1990 and included a commitment to purchase at least $100 million worth of recycled products annually for use in construction, remodeling, and equipping restaurants. Chairs, table bases, table tops, eating counters, table columns, waste receptacles, corrugated cartons, packaging, and washroom tissue were all made from recycled products. McDonald's worked with the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund to develop a comprehensive solid waste reduction program. Wrapping burgers in paper rather than plastic led to a 90 percent reduction in the wrapping material waste stream.\\r\\nIt took McDonald's 33 years to open its first 10,000 restaurants. The 10,000th unit opened in April 1988. Incredibly, the company reached the 20,000-restaurant mark in only eight more years, in mid-1996. By the end of 1997 the total had surpassed 23,000, and by that time McDonald's was opening 2,000 new restaurants each year, an average of five every day.\\r\\nMuch of the growth of the 1990s came outside the US, with international units increasing from about 3,600 in 1991 to more than 11,000 by 1998. The number of countries with McDonald's outlets nearly doubled from 59 in 1991 to 114 in late 1998. In 1993, a new region was added to the empire when the first McDonald's in the Middle East opened in Tel Aviv, Israel. As the company entered new markets, it showed increasing flexibility with respect to local food preferences and customs. In Israel, for example, the first kosher McDonald's opened in a Jerusalem suburb in 1995. In Arab countries the restaurant chain used \\"Halal\\" menus, which complied with Islamic laws for food preparation. In 1996 McDonald's entered India for the first time, where it offered a Big Mac made with lamb called the Maharaja Mac. That same year the first McSki-Thru opened in Lindvallen, Sweden.\\r\\nOverall, the company derived increasing percentages of its revenue and income from outside the US. In 1992 about two-thirds of systemwide sales came from U.S. McDonald's, but by 1997 that figure was down to about 51 percent. Similarly, the operating income numbers showed a reduction from about 60 percent of sales derived from the US in 1992 to 42.5 percent in 1997.\\r\\nIn the US, the number of units grew from 9,000 in 1991 to 12,500 in 1997, an increase of about 40 percent. Although the additional units increased market share in some markets, a number of franchisees complained that new units were cannibalizing sales from existing ones. Same-store sales for outlets open for more than one year were flat in the mid-1990s, a reflection of both the greater number of units and the mature nature of the U.S. market.\\r\\nThe company made several notable blunders in the US in the 1990s which hurt stateside profits. The McLean Deluxe sandwich, which featured a 91 percent fat-free beef patty, was introduced in 1991, never really caught on, and was dropped from the menu in February 1996 to make room for the Arch Deluxe, itself an underperforming product. The \\"grown-up\\" (and pricey) Arch Deluxe sandwich was launched in May 1996 and the Deluxe Line was launched in September 1996 in a $200 million campaign to gain the business of more adults, but were bombs. The following spring brought a 55-cent Big Mac promotion, which many customers either rejected outright or were confused by because the burgers had to be purchased with full-priced fries and a drink. The promotion embittered still more franchisees, whose complaints led to its withdrawal. In July 1997 McDonald's fired its main ad agency, Leo Burnett, a 15-year McDonald's partner after the nostalgic \\"My McDonald's\\" campaign proved a failure. Several other 1990s-debuted menu items, including fried chicken, pasta, fajitas, and pizza failed as well. A seemingly weakened McDonald's was the object of a Burger King offensive when the rival fast-food maker launched the Big King sandwich, a Big Mac clone. Meanwhile, internal taste tests revealed that customers preferred the fare at Wendy's and Burger King.\\r\\nIn response to these difficulties, McDonald's drastically cut back on its U.S. expansion. In contrast to the 1,130 units opened in 1995, only about 400 new McDonald's were built in 1997. Plans to open hundreds of smaller restaurants in Wal-Marts and gasoline stations were abandoned because test sites did not meet targeted goals. Reacting to complaints from franchisees about poor communication with the corporation and excess bureaucracy, the head of McDonald's U.S.A. (Jack M. Greenberg, who had assumed the position in October 1996) reorganized the unit into five autonomous geographic divisions. The aim was to bring management and decision-making closer to franchisees and customers.\\r\\nOn the marketing side, McDonald's scored big in 1996 and 1997 with a Teenie Beanie Baby promotion in which about 80 million of the toys/collectibles were gobbled up virtually overnight. The chain received some bad publicity, however, when it was discovered that a number of customers purchased Happy Meals just to get the toys and threw the food away. For a similar spring 1998 Teenie Beanie giveaway, the company altered the promotion to allow patrons to buy menu items other than kids' meals. McDonald's also began to benefit from a seven years global marketing alliance signed with Disney/Pixar in 1998. Initial Disney/Pixar movies promoted by McDonald's included A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles. Perhaps the most important marketing move came in the later months of 1997 when McDonald's named DDB Needham as its new lead ad agency. Needham had been the company's agency in the 1970s and was responsible for the hugely successful \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\" campaign. Late in 1997, McDonald's launched the Needham-designed \\"Did Somebody Say McDonald's?\\" campaign, which appeared to be an improvement over its predecessors.\\r\\nFollowing the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated McDonald's. In February the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based Chipotle Mexican Grill chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items. McFlurry desserts, developed by a Canadian franchisee in 1997, proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. That same month, McDonald's said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new just-in-time system, dubbed \\"Made for You\\", was in development for a number of years and aimed to deliver to customers \\"fresher, hotter food\\"; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy's); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system's enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald's offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999.\\r\\nIn May 1998, Greenberg was named president and CEO of McDonald's Corporation, with Quinlan remaining chairman; at the same time Alan D. Feldman, who had joined the company only four years earlier from Pizza Hut, replaced Greenberg as president of McDonald's U.S.A., an unusual move for a company whose executives typically were long-timers. The following month brought another first, McDonald's first job cuts. The company said it would eliminate 525 employees from its headquarters staff, a cut of about 23 percent. In the second quarter of 1998 McDonald's took a $160 million charge in relation to the cuts. As a result, the company, for the first time since it went public in 1965, recorded a decrease in net income, from $1.64 billion in 1997 to $1.55 billion in 1998.\\r\\nMcDonald's followed up its investment in Chipotle with several more moves beyond the burger business. In March 1999 the company bought Aroma Caf, a UK chain of 23 upscale coffee and sandwich shops. In July of that year McDonald's added Donatos Pizza, a midwestern chain of 143 pizzerias based in Columbus, Ohio. Donatos had revenues of $120 million in 1997. In 1999, McDonald's 25,000th unit opened, Greenberg took on the additional post of chairman, and Jim Cantalupo was named company president. Cantalupo, who had joined the company as controller in 1974 and later became head of McDonald's International, had been vice-chairman, a position he retained. In May 2000 McDonald's completed its largest acquisition yet, buying the bankrupt Boston Market chain for $173.5 million in cash and debt. At the time, there were more than 850 Boston Market outlets, which specialized in home-style meals, with rotisserie chicken the lead menu item. Revenue at Boston Market during 1999 totaled $670 million. McDonald's rounded out its acquisition spree in early 2001 by buying a 33 percent stake in Pret A Manger, an upscale urban-based chain specializing in ready-to-eat sandwiches made on the premises. There were more than 110 Pret shops in the United Kingdom and several more in New York City. Also during 2001, McDonald's sold off Aroma Caf and took its McDonald's Japan affiliate public, selling a minority stake through an initial public offering.\\r\\nAs it was exploring new avenues of growth, however, McDonald's core burger chain had become plagued by problems. Most prominently, the Made for You system backfired. Although many franchisees believed that it succeeded in improving the quality of the food, it also increased service times and proved labor-intensive. Some franchisees also complained that the actual cost of implementing the system ran much higher than the corporation had estimated, a charge that McDonald's contested. In any case, there was no question that Made for You failed to reverse the chain's sluggish sales. Growth in sales at stores open more than a year (known as same-store sales) fell in both 2000 and 2001. Late in 2001 the company launched a restructuring involving the elimination of about 850 positions, 700 of which were in the US, and several restaurant closings.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2000, a McDonald's in Dearborn, Michigan in Greater Detroit was the first one in Michigan and the only one east of the Mississippi River to offer halal food for Muslim customers.[11]\\r\\nThere were further black eyes as well. McDonald's was sued in 2001 after it was revealed that for flavoring purposes a small amount of beef extract was being added to the vegetable oil used to cook the french fries. The company had cooked its fries in beef tallow until 1990, when it began claiming in ads that it used 100 percent vegetable oil. McDonald's soon apologized for any \\"confusion\\" that had been caused by its use of the beef flavoring, and in mid-2002 it reached a settlement in the litigation, agreeing to donate $10 million to Hindu, vegetarian, and other affected groups. Also in 2001, further embarrassment came when 51 people were charged with conspiring to rig McDonald's game promotions over the course of several years. It was revealed that $24 million of winning McDonald's game tickets had been stolen as part of the scam. McDonald's was not implicated in the scheme, which centered on a worker at an outside company that had administered the promotions.\\r\\nMcDonald's also had to increasingly battle its public image as a purveyor of fatty, unhealthy food. Consumers began filing lawsuits contending that years of eating at McDonald's had made them overweight. McDonald's responded by introducing low-calorie menu items and switching to a more healthful cooking oil for its french fries. McDonald's franchises overseas became a favorite target of people and groups expressing anti-American and/or anti-globalization sentiments. In August 1999 a group of protesters led by farmer Jos Bov destroyed a half-built McDonald's restaurant in Millau, France. In 2002 Bov, who gained fame from the incident, served a three-month jail sentence for the act, which he said was in protest against U.S. trade protectionism. McDonald's was also one of three multinational corporations (along with Starbucks Corporation and Nike, Inc.) whose outlets in Seattle were attacked in late 1999 by some of the more aggressive protesters against a World Trade Organization meeting taking place there. In the early 2000s McDonald's pulled out of several countries, including Bolivia and two Middle Eastern nations, at least in part because of the negative regard with which the brand was held in some areas.\\r\\nEarly in 2002, Cantalupo retired after 28 years of service. Sales remained lackluster that year, and in October the company attempted to revive U.S. sales through the introduction of a low-cost Dollar Menu. In December 2002, after this latest initiative to reignite sales growth failed and also after profits fell in seven of the previous eight quarters, Greenberg announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Cantalupo came out of retirement to become chairman and CEO at the beginning of 2003.\\r\\nCantalupo started his tenure by announcing a major restructuring that involved the 2002 quarterly loss, which included the closure of more than 700 restaurants (mostly in the United States and Japan), the elimination of 600 jobs, and charges of $853 million. The charges resulted in a fourth-quarter 2002 loss of $343.8 million, the first quarterly loss in McDonald's 38 years as a public company. The new CEO also shifted away from the company's traditional reliance on growth through the opening of new units to a focus on gaining more sales from existing units. By 2003, with Ray Kroc's McDonald's Corporation nearly 50 and the McDonald's fast food restaurant concept itself old enough to qualify for AARP membership, the brand had perhaps become too familiar and sales figures stalled. Analysts, management, owners, and customers alike recognized that the aged chain required revivification. The question in need of solution was: How should McDonald's reinvent itself without losing its core values and maintain relevance in the marketplace? To that end, several new menu items were successfully launched, including entree salads, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches (which used pancakes in place of bread), and white-meat Chicken McNuggets. Some outlets began test-marketing fruits and vegetables as Happy Meal options. It was quickly determined that focus on customer experience was key in reversing the slippage. Then, a new global marketing campaign was adopted which was designed around the notion of the \\"Rolling Energy\\" phase. Launched on September 29, 2003, the campaign began featuring youthful images, hip music, and pop culture celebrities touting the tagline, \\"I'm lovin' it\\". Next, James R. Cantalupo was called back from retirement to head the corporation and its efforts to recapture golden luster. His plan was to keep things simple with a focus on the basics like customer service, clean restrooms, and reliable appealing food (not unlike Ray Kroc's mantra of QSC and V: Quality, Service, Cleanliness, and Value). In addition to the basics he determined to position the company with a more modern coherent image in order to foster a McDonald's \\"experience\\" for customers. More than an advertising campaign he and his team approved sweeping new architecture for McDonald's restaurants, the first major overhaul since 1969 when the now universally recognized signature double mansard roof became standard. In fact, Mr. Cantalupo personally approved abandonment of the ubiquitous and familiar mansard in favor of what became the \\"Forever Young\\" prototype topped with its swish eyebrow. This was the first global campaign in McDonald's history, as the new slogan was to be used in advertising in more than 100 countries. It also proved to be the first truly successful ad campaign in years; sales began rebounding, helped also by improvements in service. Cantalupo did not live to see the fruits of his labor and he died in 2004 just as his modern vision for McDonald's was getting underway. Nonetheless he had set things into motion causing a paradigm shift for the company resulting in a refreshed image without a dilution of brand identity.\\r\\nIn December 2003, for instance, same-store sales increased 7.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the entire year, after falling 2.1 percent in 2002. Also, in that month, McDonald's announced that it would further its focus on its core hamburger business by downsizing its other ventures. The company said that it would sell Donatos back to that chain's founder. In addition, it would discontinue development of non-McDonald's brands outside of the United States. This included Boston Market outlets in Canada and Australia and Donatos units in Germany. McDonald's kept its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald's Japan was slated to close its Pret units there. These moves would enable the company to concentrate its international efforts on the McDonald's chain, while reducing the non-hamburger brands in the United States to Chipotle and Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black.\\r\\nMcDonald's continued to curtail store openings in 2004 and to concentrate on building business at existing restaurants. Much of the more than $1.5 billion budgeted for capital expenditures in 2004 was slated to be used to remodel existing restaurants. McDonald's also aimed to pay down debt by $400 million to $700 million and to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cantalupo also set several long-term goals, such as sustaining annual systemwide sales and revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. In a move to both simplify the menu and make its offerings less fattening, McDonald's announced in March 2004 that it would phase out Super Size french fries and soft drinks by the end of the year.\\r\\nIn the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, \\"no loitering\\" had been McDonald's motto. Ray Kroc had decreed upon the origins of his version of the chain that pay telephones, jukeboxes, and vending machines of any kind were forbidden at McDonald's restaurants. The goal had been to quickly serve customers and not force them to stay in the restaurants any longer than it took them to eat a hamburger. Along that line of thinking, dining areas were designed with minimalist hard plastic tables and chairs which were more often than not bolted in place. Thus customers consumed their fast food in scant comfort without dillydally allowing room for the next hurrying customers.\\r\\nWith the new \\"Forever Young\\" design (adopted in 2006), the first major redesign since 1969, McDonald's turned a new page for itself. New and remodeled restaurants feature dining zones with \\"distinct personalities\\". Most of them offer three sections or zones. A linger zone was designed to accommodate people who were inclined to dawdle and socialize while sitting comfortably on armchairs or sofas using free wifi access. Another zone offers counters and stools for patrons in a hurry who might just grab and go. The third and perhaps most important zone is the one for families or groups where seating arrangements can be reconfigured to meet a variety of needs. Also, harsh colors and hard plastics have been replaced with custom earth tones and flexible padded fabric covered booth seating all in hopes of engaging diners to loiter and perhaps spend more money and in addition to architecture and furnishings, the McDonald's menu has been tweaked to offer a larger variety of what the corporation refers to as more healthy food.\\r\\nMcDonald's franchises are required to follow the directions of the parent company and perhaps more than a few have complained about the Forever Young changes. First, customers needed to recognize the mansard buildings and identify McDonald's with thema new look may initially generate some degree of confusion. The next objection is cost: as of 2008, a newly built swish-brow store was said to cost upwards of $1 million and renovation of an existing unit to meet the new standards as much as $400,000. With a large percentage of sales from drive-in business, franchises could argue that the expensive interior redesign is unwarranted for their bottom lines.\\r\\nIn May 2010, McDonald's redesigned its US website to a sleeker, HTML 5 friendly interface. Along with those changes, McDonald's also introduced new advertising material to its website, including the unveiling of new pictures used exclusively for in-restaurant ads, television commercials, print advertising, and online advertising, which consist of more realistic pictures of its products, which are now up close and face the camera instead of facing left or right.\\r\\nIn July 2011, McDonald's announced that their largest restaurant in the world would be built on the 2012 London Olympics site. The restaurant contains over 1,500 seats and is half the length of an American football field. Over 470 staff were employed serving on average (during the 2012 Olympics) 100,000 portions of fries, 50,000 Big Macs and 30,000 Milkshakes. This restaurant will overshadow the current largest McDonald's in the world in Moscow, Russia.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn January 2012, the company announced revenue for 2011 reached an all-time high of $27 billion, and that 2,400 restaurants would be updated and 1,300 new ones opened worldwide.[12]\\r\\nIn the middle of the decade, the restaurant began to suffer from declining profits. [13]In response, McDonald's began to offer its breakfast menu all day starting in 2015. [14] At first, the launch was unpopular with franchisees who claimed that the changes caused service to slow down. [13] However, the plan payed off with CNBC reporting that the company's fourth quarter earning \\"easily topped analysts' forecasts\\".

Some Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish and African cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. This results in a blend of the several different cultural influences, with strong similarities with the cuisine of the neighboring Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. A small but noteworthy Chinese influence can also be accounted for, mainly in the Havana area. There is also some Italian influence. During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and many Spaniards who lived there brought their culinary traditions with them [1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the colonization of Cuba by Spain, one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain. Other culinary influences include Africa, from the Africans that were brought to Cuba as slaves, and French, from the French colonists that came to Cuba from Haiti.[2] Another factor is that Cuba is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine. Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is that Cuba is in a tropical climate, which produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals.[3]\\r\\nA typical meal consists of rice and beans, cooked together or apart. When cooked together the recipe is called \\"congri\\" or \\"Moros\\" or \\"Moros y Cristianos\\" (black beans and rice). If cooked separately it is called \\"arroz con frijoles\\" (rice with beans) or \\"arroz y frijoles\\" (rice and beans).[4]\\r\\nA Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a mixto, especially in Cuba[5][6]) is a popular lunch item that grew out of the once-open flow of cigar workers between Cuba and Florida (specifically Key West and the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa) in the late 1800s and has since spread to other Cuban American communities.[7][8][9]\\r\\nThe sandwich is built on a base of lightly buttered Cuban bread and contains sliced roast pork, thinly sliced Serrano ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. In Tampa, Genoa salami[10] is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to influence of Italian immigrants who lived side-by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City.[11] Tomatoes and lettuce are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as an unacceptable Americanization of the sandwich.[5][12]\\r\\nAfter assembly, the Cuban sandwich may be pressed in a grooveless panini-type grill called a plancha, which both heats and compresses the contents.[5]","input":"What type of food is cuba known for?"},{"output":"the muscles and liver","context":"Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in humans,[2] animals,[3] fungi, and bacteria. The polysaccharide structure represents the main storage form of glucose in the body.\\r\\nGlycogen functions as one of two forms of long-term energy reserves, with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat). In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle.[2][4] In the liver, glycogen can make up from 5ÿ6% of the organ's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70?kg can store roughly 100ÿ120?grams of glycogen.[2][5] In skeletal muscle, Glycogen is found in a low concentration (1ÿ2% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70?kg can store roughly 400?grams of glycogen.[2] The amount of glycogen stored in the bodyparticularly within the muscles and livermostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells,[6][7][8] white blood cells,[medical citation needed] and glial cells in the brain.[9] The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo.[10]\\r\\nApproximately 4?grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times;[2] in fasted individuals, blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle.[2] Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself;[2] however, the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues.[2] Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system.[2] The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals.[2]\\r\\nGlycogen is the analogue of starch, a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants. It has a structure similar to amylopectin (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white powders in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol/cytoplasm in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 10-14 glucose units[11]. Glucose units are linked together linearly by ϫ(1L4) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by ϫ(1L6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.[12]\\r\\nDue to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein.[13]\\r\\nGlycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45?millimoles of potassium per gram of glycogen.[4]\\r\\nAs a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the pancreas secretes insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes, including glycogen synthase. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or \\"fed\\" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.\\r\\nAfter a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8ÿ12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.\\r\\nGlucagon, another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from other sources).\\r\\nMuscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase, which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.[citation needed]\\r\\nGlycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a \\"ferment\\" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called \\"la matire glycogne\\", or \\"sugar-forming substance\\". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of (C\\r\\n6H\\r\\n10O\\r\\n5)n was established by Kekule in 1858.[14]\\r\\nGlycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonicit requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTPglucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding ϫ(1L4)-bonded glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.\\r\\nGlycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:\\r\\nIn vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.[15] Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase. A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the ϫ(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:\\r\\nThe most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.\\r\\nIn hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.\\r\\nVarious inborn errors of metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases.\\r\\nLong-distance athletes, such as marathon runners, cross-country skiers, and cyclists, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as \\"hitting the wall\\".\\r\\nGlycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high glycemic index) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,[16][17][citation needed] sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.[18][19][20] This process is known as carbohydrate loading. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.[21][22]\\r\\nWhen experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme fatigue to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference, the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies.\\r\\nWhen athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly;[23][24][25] however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.[25]","input":"Where is glucose stored in the human body?"},{"output":"the taijitu","context":"A taijitu (simplified Chinese: QZ; traditional Chinese: Q?O?D; pinyin: tijt~; WadeÿGiles: t'ai?chi2t'u2)  is a symbol or diagram (Z t~) in Chinese philosophy representing Taiji (Q tij \\"great pole\\" or \\"supreme ultimate\\") representing both its monist (wuji) and its dualist (yin and yang) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by  Song Dynasty philosopher Zhou Dunyi (J 1017ÿ1073) in his Taijitu shuo Q?O?D.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern Taoist canon, compiled during the Ming era, has at least half a dozen variants of such taijitu. The two most similar are the \\"Taiji Primal Heaven\\" (Q?O暷?D tij  xintin t~) and the \\"wuji\\" (?o?O?D w~j t~) diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's taijitu.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMing period author Lai Zhide (1525ÿ1604) simplified the taijitu to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the taijitu with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the He tu or \\"Yellow River diagram\\" (T?D). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the \\"Great Monad\\",[2] and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the \\"yin-yang symbol\\" since the 1960s.[3] The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is Q??xZ \\"two-part Taiji diagram\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nUnicode features the \\"yin-yang symbol\\" in the Miscellaneous Symbols block, at code point U+262F  (YIN YANG ?). The related \\"double body symbol\\" is included at U+0FCA  (TIBETAN SYMBOL NOR BU NYIS -KHYIL ?), in the Tibetan block.\\r\\nThe Soyombo symbol, that includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as U+11A9E, ??, U+11A9F, ??, and U+11AA0, ??.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnamental patterns with visual similarity to the \\"yin-yang symbol\\" are found in archaeological artefacts of European prehistory; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed \\"yin yang symbols\\" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taijitu consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the \\"yin and yang symbol\\", itself popularly called taijitu, represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term taijitu in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple \\"divided circle\\" form (), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of symmetry representing yin and yang.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the concept of yin and yang dates to Chinese antiquity,[7]\\r\\nthe interest in \\"diagrams\\" (?D t~) is an intellectual fashion of Neo-Confucianism during the Song period (11th century), and it declined again\\r\\nin the Ming period, by the 16th century.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original description of a taijitu is due to Song era philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017ÿ1073), author of the Taijitu shuo Q?O?D \\"Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\\", which became the cornerstone of Neo-Confucianist cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism with metaphysical discussions in the Yijing.\\r\\n\\r\\nZhou's key terms Wuji and Taiji appear in the opening line ?o?OWQ?O, which Adler notes could also be translated \\"The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-polar (wuji) and yet Supreme Polarity (taiji)! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates yang; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates yin; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing yin and yang, the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of yang and yin generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] qi harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply yin and yang; yin and yang are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.[9]\\r\\nInstead of usual Taiji translations \\"Supreme Ultimate\\" or \\"Supreme Pole\\", Adler uses \\"Supreme Polarity\\" (see Robinet 1990) because Zhu Xi describes it as the alternating principle of yin and yang, and ...\\r\\n\\r\\ninsists that taiji is not a thing (hence \\"Supreme Pole\\" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, taiji is the yin-yang principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic \\"first principle.\\" Wuji as \\"non-polar\\" follows from this. \\r\\nSince the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.\\r\\nZhu Xi (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources.\\r\\nZhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of dao.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Zhou Dunyi (1017ÿ1073) popularized the circular diagram,[12] the introduction of \\"swirling\\" patterns first appears in the Ming period.\\r\\n\\r\\nZhao Huiqian (f?t, 1351ÿ1395) was the first to introduce the \\"swirling\\" variant of the taijitu in his Liushu benyi (?x, 1370s).\\r\\nThe diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (bagua) and called the \\"River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth\\".\\r\\nBy the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of Chinese cosmology.[13]\\r\\nThe dots are introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the Qing period.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nLai Zhide's design is similar to the gakyil (dga' 'khyil or \\"wheel of joy\\") symbols of Tibetan Buddhism;\\r\\nbut while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the Three Jewels or the Four Noble Truths, i.e. as a triskele and a tetraskelion design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals has been reported as \\"yin-yang symbol\\" in the first half of the 20th century.\\r\\nThe flag of South Korea, originally introduced as the flag of Joseon era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the Bat Quai Do used as the Joseon royal standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, \\"yin-yang symbol\\" is most widely applied to the He tu symbol which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots.\\r\\nIn the standard form of the contemporary \\"yin-yang symbol\\", one draws on the diameter of a circle two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the radius of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an \\"S\\", and one erases or obscures the other line.[16] The design is also described[according to whom?][year?needed] \\"pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soyombo symbol of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.\\r\\nIt combines several abstract shapes, including a Taiji symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern  symbol has  also been widely used in martial arts, particularly t'ai chi ch'uan (Taijiquan),[19] and Jeet Kune Do, since the 1970s.[20]\\r\\nIn this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between hard and soft techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dots in the modern \\"yin-yang symbol\\" have been given the additional interpretation of \\"intense interaction\\" between the complementary principles.\\r\\n[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1882 flag of Korea (since 1949 the flag of South Korea)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Great Monad\\" from Edna Kenton's Book of Earths (1928), after the design shown by Hampden Coit DuBose (1887)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"cycle of Cathay\\" as depicted by William Alexander Parsons Martin in 1897.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoat of arms adopted by Niels Bohr in 1947, showing a taijitu in red and black, with the motto contraria sunt complementa  (\\"opposites are complementary\\").[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Yin-Yang symbol or Tao symbol\\" (without the dots) as reported in 1964.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBagua: Modern Taijitu with I Ching trigrams\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral flags of Mongolia have incorporated a taiji symbol since 1911.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag of Tibet includes a taijitu since 1916\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarities can be seen in Tripilja culture in Ukraine, displayed in the Ukraine pavilion at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China.[25] Also, the interlocking design is found in artifacts of the European Iron Age.[4][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this design appears to become a standard ornamental motif in Iron-Age Celtic culture by the 3rd century BC, found on a wide variety of artifacts, it is not clear what symbolic value, was attached to it.[27][28] Unlike the Chinese symbol, the Celtic yin-yang lack the element of mutual penetration, and the two halves are not always portrayed in different colors.[29] Comparable designs are also found in Etruscan art.[5]","input":"What is the yin and yang symbol called?"},{"output":"isotopes","context":"Naturally occurring silver (47Ag) is composed of the two stable isotopes 107Ag and 109Ag with 107Ag being the more abundant (51.839% natural abundance).

To provide this service, the Brazilian government created a national public health insurance system called SUS (Sistema Unico de Sa~de, Unified Health System) in which all publicly funded hospitals (public and philanthropic entities) receive payments based on the number of patients and procedures performed.

The remaining third is split between for-profit and public, public hospitals not necessarily being not-for-profit hospital corporations. The urban public hospitals are often associated with medical schools.[8][9] The largest public hospital system in America is NYC Health + Hospitals.\\r\\nThe safety-net role of public hospitals has evolved since 1700s when the first U.S. public hospital sheltered and provided medical healthcare to the poor.[10] Until the late 20th century, public hospitals represented the \\"poor house\\" that undertook social welfare roles. The \\"poor house\\" also provided secondarily medical care, specifically during epidemics. For this reason, these \\"poor houses\\" were later known as \\"pest\\" houses. Following this phase was the \\"practitioner period\\" during which, the then welfare oriented urban public hospitals changed their focus to medical care and formalized nursing care. This new phase was highlighted by the private physicians providing care to patients outside their private practices into inpatient hospital settings. To put into practice the demands of the Flexner Report published in 1910, public hospitals later benefitted from the best medical care technology to hire full-time staff members,[8] instruct medical and nursing students during the \\"academic period\\".[10] The privatization of public hospitals was often contemplated during this period and stalled once an infectious disease outbreak such as influenza in 1918, tuberculosis in the early 1900s, and the polio epidemic in the 1950s hit the U.S.. At this time, with the goal to improve people's health and welfare by allowing for effective health planning and the creation of neighborhood health centers, health policies like the Social Security Act were enacted.[8] This was followed by Medicare and Medicaid Act in 1965 that gave poor Americans, mostly ethnic and racial minorities, access to inpatient and outpatient medical care[11] from public hospitals after racial segregation ended in the South. With their mandate to care for low income patients, the public hospital started engaging in leadership roles in the communities they care for since the 1980s.\\r\\nIn the U.S., public hospitals receive significant funding from local, state, and/or federal governments. Currently, many urban public hospitals in the U.S. playing the role of safety-net hospitals, which do not turn away the underinsured and uninsured such as the vulnerable ethnic minorities,[11] may charge Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurers for the care of patients. Public hospitals, especially in urban areas, have a high concentration of uncompensated care and graduate medical education as compared to all other American hospitals. 23% of emergency care, 63% of burn care and 40% of trauma care are handled by public hospitals in the urban cities of the United States.[12] Many public hospitals also develop programs for illness prevention with the goal of reducing the cost of care for low-income patients and the hospital, involving Community Health Needs Assessment and identifying and addressing the social, economic, environmental, and individual behavioral determinants of health.[10][12]\\r\\nFor-profit hospitals were more likely to provide profitable medical services and less likely to provide medical services that were relatively unprofitable. Government or public hospitals were more likely to offer relatively unprofitable medical services. Not-for-profit hospitals often fell in the middle between public and for-profit hospitals in the types of medical services they provided. For-profit hospitals were quicker to respond to changes in profitability of medical services than the other two types of hospitals.[13]\\r\\nPublic hospitals in America are closing at a much faster rate than hospitals overall. The number of public hospitals in major suburbs declined 27% (134 to 98) from 1996 to 2002.[14] Much research has proven the increase in uninsured and Medicaid enrollment entwined to unmet needs for disproportionate share subsidies to be associated with the challenges faced by public hospitals to maintain their financial viability as they compete with the private sector for paying patients. Since the creation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, 15 million of the 48 million previously uninsured receive Medicaid. It is projected that this number will grow to about 33 million by 2018.[15] The provision of good quality ambulatory specialty care for these uninsured and Medicaid enrolled patients has particularly been a challenge for many urban public hospitals. This accounts for many factors ranging from a shortage of specialists who are more likely to practice in the more profitable sectors than in the safety-net, to the lack of clinical space. To overcome this challenge, some public hospitals have adopted disease prevention methods, the increase of specialty providers and clinics, deployment of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in specialty clinics, asynchronous electronic consultations, telehealth, the integration of Primary Care Providers (PCP) in the specialty clinics, and referral by PCP's to specialists.[10][15]\\r\\nIn India, public hospitals (called Government Hospitals) provide health care free at the point of use for any Indian citizen. These are usually individual state funded. However, hospitals funded by the central (federal) government also exist. State hospitals are run by the state (local) government and may be dispensaries, peripheral health centers, rural hospital, district hospitals or medical college hospitals (hospitals with affiliated medical college). In many states (like Tamil Nadu) the hospital bill is entirely funded by the state government with patient not having to pay anything for treatment. However, other hospitals will charge nominal amounts for admission to special rooms and for medical and surgical consumables. The reliability and approachability of doctors and staff in private hospitals have resulted in preference of people from the public to private health centers.[16]. However state owned hospitals are known for high patient load and incidents of physical abuse on doctors and staff.[17]","input":"Who is the public hospital sector funded by?"},{"output":"The speed of the reaction","context":"An explosion is a rapid increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases.

Most natural explosions arise from volcanic processes of various sorts. Explosive volcanic eruptions occur when magma rising from below has much-dissolved gas in it; the reduction of pressure as the magma rises causes the gas to bubble out of solution, resulting in a rapid increase in volume. Explosions also occur as a result of impact events and in phenomena such as hydrothermal explosions (also due to volcanic processes). Explosions can also occur outside of Earth in the universe in events such as supernova. Explosions frequently occur during bushfires in eucalyptus forests where the volatile oils in the tree tops suddenly combust.[1]\\r\\nAmong the largest known explosions in the universe are supernovae, which results when a star explodes from the sudden starting or stopping of nuclear fusion, and gamma ray bursts, whose nature is still in some dispute. Solar flares are an example of common explosion on the Sun, and presumably on most other stars as well. The energy source for solar flare activity comes from the tangling of magnetic field lines resulting from the rotation of the Sun's conductive plasma. Another type of large astronomical explosion occurs when a very large meteoroid or an asteroid impacts the surface of another object, such as a planet.\\r\\nThe most common artificial explosives are chemical explosives, usually involving a rapid and violent oxidation reaction that produces large amounts of hot gas. Gunpowder was the first explosive to be discovered and put to use. Other notable early developments in chemical explosive technology were Frederick Augustus Abel's development of nitrocellulose in 1865 and Alfred Nobel's invention of dynamite in 1866. Chemical explosions (both intentional and accidental) are often initiated by an electric spark or flame. Accidental explosions may occur in fuel tanks, rocket engines, etc.\\r\\nA high current electrical fault can create an 'electrical explosion' by forming a high energy electrical arc which rapidly vaporizes metal and insulation material. This arc flash hazard is a danger to persons working on energized switchgear. Also, excessive magnetic pressure within an ultra-strong electromagnet can cause a magnetic explosion.\\r\\nStrictly a physical process, as opposed to chemical or nuclear, e.g., the bursting of a sealed or partially sealed container under internal pressure is often referred to as a 'mechanical explosion'. Examples include an overheated boiler or a simple tin can of beans tossed into a fire.\\r\\nBoiling liquid expanding vapor explosions are one type of mechanical explosion that can occur when a vessel containing a pressurized liquid is ruptured, causing a rapid increase in volume as the liquid evaporates. Note that the contents of the container may cause a subsequent chemical explosion, the effects of which can be dramatically more serious, such as a propane tank in the midst of a fire. In such a case, to the effects of the mechanical explosion when the tank fails are added the effects from the explosion resulting from the released (initially liquid and then almost instantaneously gaseous) propane in the presence of an ignition source. For this reason, emergency workers often differentiate between the two events.\\r\\nIn addition to stellar nuclear explosions, a man-made nuclear weapon is a type of explosive weapon that derives its destructive force from nuclear fission or from a combination of fission and fusion. As a result, even a nuclear weapon with a small yield is significantly more powerful than the largest conventional explosives available, with a single weapon capable of completely destroying an entire city.\\r\\nExplosive force is released in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the explosive. If a grenade is in mid air during the explosion and the direction of the blast will be 360. In contrast, in a shaped charge the explosive forces are focused to produce a greater local effect.\\r\\nThe speed of the reaction is what distinguishes an explosive reaction from an ordinary combustion reaction. Unless the reaction occurs very rapidly, the thermally expanding gases will be moderately dissipated in the medium, with no large differential in pressure and there will be no explosion. Consider a wood fire. As the fire burns, there certainly is the evolution of heat and the formation of gases, but neither is liberated rapidly enough to build up a sudden substantial pressure differential and then cause an explosion. This can be likened to the difference between the energy discharge of a battery, which is slow, and that of a flash capacitor like that in a camera flash, which releases its energy all at once.\\r\\nThe generation of heat in large quantities accompanies most explosive chemical reactions. The exceptions are called entropic explosives and include organic peroxides such as acetone peroxide[2] It is the rapid liberation of heat that causes the gaseous products of most explosive reactions to expand and generate high pressures. This rapid generation of high pressures of the released gas constitutes the explosion. The liberation of heat with insufficient rapidity will not cause an explosion. For example, although a unit mass of coal yields five times as much heat as a unit mass of nitroglycerin, the coal cannot be used as an explosive (except in the form of coal dust) because the rate at which it yields this heat is quite slow. In fact, a substance which burns less rapidly (i.e. slow combustion) may actually evolve more total heat than an explosive which detonates rapidly (i.e. fast combustion). In the former, slow combustion converts more of the internal energy (i.e. chemical potential) of the burning substance into heat released to the surroundings, while in the latter, fast combustion (i.e. detonation) instead converts more internal energy into work on the surroundings (i.e. less internal energy converted into heat); c.f. heat and work (thermodynamics) are equivalent forms of energy. See Heat of Combustion for a more thorough treatment of this topic.\\r\\nWhen a chemical compound is formed from its constituents, heat may either be absorbed or released. The quantity of heat absorbed or given off during transformation is called the heat of formation. Heats of formations for solids and gases found in explosive reactions have been determined for a temperature of 25?C and atmospheric pressure, and are normally given in units of kilojoules per gram-molecule. A positive value indicates that heat is absorbed during the formation of the compound from its elements; such a reaction is called an endothermic reaction. In explosive technology only materials that are exothermicthat have a net liberation of heat and have a negative heat of formationare of interest. Reaction heat is measured under conditions either of constant pressure or constant volume. It is this heat of reaction that may be properly expressed as the \\"heat of explosion.\\"\\r\\nA chemical explosive is a compound or mixture which, upon the application of heat or shock, decomposes or rearranges with extreme rapidity, yielding much gas and heat. Many substances not ordinarily classed as explosives may do one, or even two, of these things.\\r\\nA reaction must be capable of being initiated by the application of shock, heat, or a catalyst (in the case of some explosive chemical reactions) to a small portion of the mass of the explosive material. A material in which the first three factors exist cannot be accepted as an explosive unless the reaction can be made to occur when needed.\\r\\nFragmentation is the accumulation and projection of particles as the result of a high explosives detonation. Fragments could be part of a structure such as a magazine. High velocity, low angle fragments can travel hundreds or thousands of feet with enough energy to initiate other surrounding high explosive items, injure or kill personnel and damage vehicles or structures.\\r\\nClassical Latin expldere means \\"to hiss a bad actor off the stage\\", \\"to drive an actor off the stage by making noise\\", from ex- (out) + plaudere (to clap; to applaud).. The modern meaning developed later:[3]\\r\\nIn English:","input":"What is the difference between combustion and explosion?"},{"output":"Christopher Mark \\"Chris\\" Robinson","context":"Christopher Mark \\"Chris\\" Robinson (born December 20, 1966) is an American musician. He was the singer of the rock and roll band The Black Crowes and brother of its guitarist Rich Robinson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson was born in Marietta, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. He is the son of Nancy Jane (ne Bradley) and Stanley \\"Stan\\" Robinson, who had a minor Billboard charted record in 1959 called \\"Boom-A-Dip-Dip\\" and who died in September 2013.[1] Along with his brother Rich, Robinson formed Mr. Crowe's Garden in the 1980s, having been heavily influenced by The Faces and The Rolling Stones.[2] They played a variety of clubs in and around Atlanta.\\r\\nRobinson attended Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina. While some fellow students had posters of bikini girls lying on Porsches, Robinson decorated his dorm room with a Tom Waits poster and a Dream Syndicate poster: \\"...even at 18, I was into music.\\"[3]\\r\\nIn 1989, Mr. Crowe's Garden changed their name to The Black Crowes. They were signed to Rick Rubin's label Def American and released their debut album Shake Your Money Maker. With the success of their album they went out on tour to support it. They played several dates supporting ZZ Top. During this tour Chris was criticized for talking to the audience about his opposition to corporate sponsorship. This led to ZZ Top firing The Black Crowes from the tour.\\r\\nIn May 1991, Chris Robinson spat at or on a female customer at a 7-Eleven convenience store. Robinson was arrested for assault and disturbing the peace, and pleaded no contest six months later. In the media, Robinson would openly discuss his use of marijuana.\\r\\nOver the next nine years The Black Crowes went through many lineup changes and released six studio albums. In 1997, The Black Crowes headlined the second Furthur Festival, which had been spawned in the summer of 1996 by the remaining members of the Grateful Dead following Jerry Garcia's death in August 1995. In early 2002, it was announced that drummer Steve Gorman would be leaving the band and that The Black Crowes would be taking a break.\\r\\nHis first solo recording, \\"The Red Road\\", appeared on the soundtrack to the 2002 Goldie Hawn (whose daughter, Kate Hudson, was Robinson's spouse from 2000-2006) film The Banger Sisters, confirming the singer's turn into softer material. A full-length debut, New Earth Mud, appeared in October and garnered positive critical reviews. Written and produced with Paul Stacey and featuring collaborations with ex-Crowes Marc Ford and Eddie Harsch, the album allowed Robinson to hit the road as a headlining act. The band itself became known as New Earth Mud and earned a reputation for playing lengthy, jam-oriented sets across the United States.\\r\\nNew Earth Mud toured well into 2003, both headlining and sharing the bill with such acts as Elvis Costello, Gov't Mule and The String Cheese Incident. Robinson headed into the studio after the tour concluded, again with Paul Stacey as co-songwriter and producer. The end result was This Magnificent Distance, released in June 2004. The album was a bigger commercial success than its predecessor and showcased more of a \\"full band\\" sound.\\r\\nRobinson parted ways with Paul Stacey and the rest of his band in early 2004, the reason for which remains unknown. In a very cryptic post on his official message board, Robinson said farewell to his original line-up and welcomed a new one, which featured ex-Crowes member Audley Freed on guitar and studio virtuoso George Reiff on bass. The band toured in support of This Magnificent Distance through the Summer of 2004. Another tour was planned for the fall of 2004 but was abruptly and inexplicably scrapped. Robinson instead remained out of the public eye aside from three appearances with Phil Lesh and Friends at the Warfield Theater in San Francisco (December 2004).\\r\\nRobinson did not perform publicly again until his February 2005 performance with his brother Rich at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (a private event for people who work in the field of consumer electronics). He then joined Phil Lesh again for the Mardi Gras Spectacular concerts in San Francisco at the end of February, which also featured members of Railroad Earth, Particle and Galactic as well as former members of the Jerry Garcia Band.\\r\\nIn early 2005, it was announced that The Black Crowes would be reuniting for a run at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. This lineup included former members Sven Pipien and Marc Ford. This quickly turned into a full-fledged tour. Although initially not part of the reunion, Steve Gorman did return to the band in early May. In July 2007, during the Black Crowes Summer Tour, the live album Brothers of a Feather: Live at the Roxy was released.\\r\\nThe album was composed of tracks culled from Chris and Rich Robinson's three night set at the Roxy, and featured Black Crowes songs (Horsehead, Cursed Diamond, Thorn In My Pride), solo material from both brothers (Someday Past the Sunset, Forgiven Song), covers from some of their favorite artists (Over the Hill, Roll Um Easy, Driving Wheel, Forever Young), and new material (Magic Rooster Blues, Cold Boy Smile). A new album, Warpaint, was released on March 4, 2008.\\r\\nOn August 31, 2009, the Black Crowes released another album of original material, recorded in front of a live audience over several shows at Levon Helm's barn in New York, Before the Frost... Each CD purchase was accompanied by a download code to receive the album's companion release, ...Until the Freeze. The vinyl version includes all 20 tracks.\\r\\nIn April 2010, it was announced that in celebration of the band's 20th anniversary, they would release Croweology, featuring new acoustic recordings of Black Crowes' favorites. The two-disc set would be sold at the price of one as a thank you to fans. In conjunction with the release, the band would also embark on the \\"Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys\\" tour, which would stretch from August 2010 ÿ December 2010. The majority of the shows saw the band perform two 90?minute sets, the first acoustic, and the second electric. At the end of the tour, it was announced the band would begin a new hiatus of undetermined length.[4]\\r\\nIn the fall of 2010, www.chrisrobinsonband.com appeared, fueling speculation that this would be Chris' new project with the advent of the Crowes' hiatus. This was confirmed at the final date of the Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys Tour in San Francisco, when stickers advertising the band and the website were passed out promoting April 2011. Eventually, the project was titled the Chris Robinson Brotherhood (CRB), and a two months California tour was launched on March 29, 2011 at Soho in Santa Barbara, California. The Chris Robinson Brotherhood lineup includes Adam MacDougall (of the Black Crowes) on keyboards, George Sluppick on drums (George has been replaced by Tony Leone), Mark \\"Muddy\\" Dutton (of Burning Tree) on bass, and Neal Casal on guitar. Casal replaced Jonathan Wilson, who was initially announced as a member of the band, but left shortly after.\\r\\nCRB went into Sunset Studios to record an album in January 2012. Their first album, Big Moon Ritual, was released on June 5, 2012,[5] with the companion album The Magic Door released on September 11, 2012.[6] CRB also released a 7\\" of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" b/w a live version \\"Girl, I Love You\\" for Record Store Day on April 21, 2012.[7]\\r\\nAlthough he dabbled in the field earlier, Robinson began consistently producing other artists' albums in the late-2000s. Although few of the albums produced under his guidance were commercial successes, most received considerable critical acclaim.\\r\\nRobinson made a cameo appearance (playing an angel) in the final episode of the popular sketch show The Kids in the Hall in 1994.[8] According to The Kids in the Hall Season 5 DVD commentary, Robinson met Kate Hudson at a live The Kids in the Hall performance during their 2000 reunion tour. In 2007, Chris Robinson played Wavy Gravy's birthday party in San Francisco under the name Chris Robinson's Wooden Family. The show was a benefit to support an international development organization called the Seva Foundation founded by Wavy along with Ram Dass.[9]\\r\\nIn 2009, Robinson performed in The People Speak, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States.[10]\\r\\nOn September 8, 1996, he married actress Lala Sloatman, niece of musician Frank Zappa. They were divorced in 1998.\\r\\nIn December 2000, Robinson married actress Kate Hudson. Their son, Ryder Russell Robinson, was born on January 7, 2004. On August 14, 2006, after nearly six years of marriage, Hudson's publicist announced their separation. On November 17, 2006, Robinson filed divorce papers, citing irreconcilable differences and seeking joint custody of their son. Divorce was granted on October 22, 2007, with Robinson being granted joint custody of Ryder.[11]\\r\\nIn 2009, Robinson married Allison Bridges. Their daughter, Cheyenne Genevieve Robinson, was born on December 26, 2009.[12]","input":"Who is the lead singer for the black crowes?"},{"output":"Eight","context":"The CanadaÿUnited States border (French: Frontire entre le Canada et les tats-Unis), officially known as the International Boundary, is the longest international border in the world between two countries. It is shared between Canada and the United States, the second- and fourth-largest countries by area, respectively. The terrestrial boundary (including portions of maritime boundaries in the Great Lakes, and on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts) is 8,891 kilometres (5,525?mi) long, of which 2,475 kilometres (1,538?mi) is Canada's border with Alaska. Eight Canadian provinces and territories (Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick), and thirteen U.S. states (Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) are located along the border.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Paris of 1783 ended the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain and the United States. In the second article of the Treaty the parties agreed on all of the boundaries of the United States, including but not limited to the boundary with British North America to the north. The agreed boundary included the line from the northwest angle of Nova Scotia to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River, and proceeded down along the middle of the river to the 45th parallel of north latitude.\\r\\nThat parallel had been established in the 1760s as the boundary between the provinces of Quebec and New York (including what later became the state of Vermont). It was surveyed and marked by John Collins and Thomas Valentine in 1771ÿ3.[1]\\r\\nThe St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes became the boundary further west (between what is now Ontario and the United States).\\r\\nNorthwest of Lake Superior, the boundary followed rivers to the Lake of the Woods. From the Lake of the Woods, the boundary was agreed to go straight west until it met the Mississippi River. In fact that line never meets the river since the river's source is further south.\\r\\nThe Jay Treaty of 1794 (effective 1796) created the International Boundary Commission, which was charged with surveying and mapping the boundary. It also provided for removal of British military and administration from Detroit and other frontier outposts on the U.S. side. It was superseded by the Treaty of Ghent (effective 1815) concluding the War of 1812, which included pre-war boundaries.\\r\\nThe RushÿBagot Treaty of 1817 provided a plan for demilitarizing the two combatant sides in the War of 1812 and also laid out preliminary principles for drawing a border between British North America (later Canada) and the United States.\\r\\nWestward expansion of both British North America and the United States saw the boundary extended west along the 49th parallel from the Northwest Angle at Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains under the Treaty of 1818. That treaty extinguished British claims south of that latitude to the Red River Valley, which was part of Rupert's Land. The treaty also extinguished U.S. claims to land north of that line in the watershed of the Missouri River, which was part of the Louisiana Purchase; this amounted to three small areas, consisting of the northern part of the drainages of the Milk River (today in southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan), the Poplar River (Saskatchewan), and Big Muddy Creek (Saskatchewan).[citation needed]\\r\\nAlong the 49th parallel, the border vista is theoretically straight but in practice follows the 19th-century surveyed border markers and varies by several hundred feet in spots.[2]\\r\\nDisputes over the interpretation of the border treaties and mistakes in surveying required additional negotiations resulting in the WebsterÿAshburton Treaty of 1842. The treaty resolved the dispute known as the Aroostook War over the boundary between Maine on the one hand, and New Brunswick and the Province of Canada on the other. The treaty redefined the border between New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York on the one hand, and the Province of Canada on the other, resolving the Indian Stream dispute and the Fort Blunder dilemma at the outlet to Lake Champlain.\\r\\nThe part of the 45th parallel that separates Quebec from the U.S. states of Vermont and New York had first been surveyed in 1771ÿ3 after it had been declared the boundary between New York (including what later became Vermont) and Quebec, and it was surveyed again after the War of 1812. The US Government began to construct fortifications just south of the border at Rouses Point on Lake Champlain. After a significant portion of the construction was completed, measurements revealed that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile (1.2?km) south of the surveyed line; the fort, which became known as \\"Fort Blunder\\", was in Canada. This created a dilemma for the United States that was not resolved until a provision of the treaty left the border on the meandering line as surveyed. The border along the Boundary Waters in present-day Ontario and Minnesota between Lake Superior and the Northwest Angle was also redefined.[3][4]\\r\\nAn 1844 boundary dispute during U.S. President James K. Polk's administration led to a call for the northern boundary of the U.S. west of the Rockies to be latitude 54?40' north (related to the southern boundary of Russia's Alaska Territory), but the United Kingdom wanted a border that followed the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. The dispute was resolved in the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which established the 49th parallel as the boundary through the Rockies.\\r\\nThe Northwest Boundary Survey (1857ÿ61) laid out the land boundary, but the water boundary was not settled for some time. After the Pig War in 1859, arbitration in 1872 established the border between the Gulf Islands and the San Juan Islands.\\r\\nThe International Boundary Survey, called the Northern Boundary Survey in the United States, began in 1872.[5] Its mandate was to establish the border as agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. Archibald Campbell led the way for the United States. Donald Cameron headed the British team. This survey focused on the border from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains.[6]\\r\\nIn 1903 a joint United Kingdom?ÿ Canada?ÿ U.S. tribunal established the boundary of southeast Alaska.[7]\\r\\nOn April 11, 1908, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed, under Article IV of the Treaty of 1908, to survey and delimit the boundary between Canada and the United States through the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes, in accordance with modern surveying techniques, and thus accomplished several changes to the border.[8][9]\\r\\nIn 1925, the International Boundary Commission (French: Commission de la frontire international) was made a permanent organization responsible for surveying and mapping the boundary, maintaining boundary monuments (and buoys where applicable), and keeping the boundary clear of brush and vegetation for 6 metres (20?ft). This \\"border vista\\" extends for 3 metres (9.8?ft) on each side of the line.\\r\\nThe Commission is headed by two commissioners, one of whom is Canadian, the other American.[10]\\r\\nThe International Boundary is commonly referred to as the world's longest undefended border, but this is true only in the military sense, as civilian law enforcement is present. It is illegal to cross the border outside border controls. Everyone crossing the border must be checked. The relatively low level of security measures stands in contrast to that of the United States?ÿ Mexico border (one-third as long as the CanadaÿU.S. border), which is actively patrolled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking.\\r\\nParts of the International Boundary cross through mountainous terrain or heavily forested areas, but significant portions also cross remote prairie farmland and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, in addition to the maritime components of the boundary at the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans. The border also runs through the middle of the Akwesasne Nation and even divides some buildings found in communities in Vermont and Quebec.[?Some recent editing activity in this paragraph is disputed. ÿ discuss?] Such buildlings are sometimes called line houses. The MaineÿNew Brunswick border divides the Aroostook Valley Country Club.[11]\\r\\nThe actual number of U.S. and Canadian border security personnel is classified; there are in excess of 17,000 United States Border Patrol personnel on the MexicoÿU.S. border alone.[12]\\r\\nFollowing the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, security along the border was dramatically tightened by both nations in both populated and rural areas. Both nations are also actively involved in detailed and extensive tactical and strategic intelligence sharing.\\r\\nAs of December 2010[update], Canada and the United States are negotiating an agreement titled \\"Beyond the Border: A Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Competitiveness\\" which would give the U.S. more influence over Canada's border security and immigration controls, and more information would be shared by Canada with the U.S.[13]\\r\\nResidents of both nations who own property adjacent to the border are forbidden to build within the six-meter-wide (almost 20 feet) boundary vista without permission from the International Boundary Commission. They are required to report such construction to their respective governments.\\r\\nWhere required, fences or vehicle blockades are used. All persons crossing the border are required to report to the respective customs and immigration agencies in each country. In remote areas where staffed border crossings are not available, there are hidden sensors on roads and also scattered in wooded areas near crossing points and on many trails and railways, but there are not enough border personnel on either side to verify and stop coordinated incursions.[citation needed] There is no border zone;[14] the U.S. Customs and Border Protection routinely sets up checkpoints as far as 100 miles (160?km) into U.S. territory.[15][16]\\r\\nIn August of 2017, Customs and Immigration Union President Jean-Pierre Fortin that up to 500 people each day are crossing into Quebec illegally, totaling more than 10,000 on the year.[17] Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced backlash over his #WelcometoCanada tweet alongside his sentiment of welcoming refugees fleeing terror, persecution, and violence into the country.[18][19] Trudeau later clarified that his tweet was in response to President of the United States Donald Trump's proposed travel ban on people from mostly Muslim countries. The Prime Minister then went on to say You will not be at an advantage if you choose to enter Canada irregularly. You must follow the rules and there are many.\\"[20] By the end of August, Trudeau stated that through additional staffing resources and expedited processes at the border, the Canadian government had taken control of the large increase in migrants coming across the border illegally.[21]\\r\\nSmuggling of alcoholic beverages (\\"rum running\\") was widespread during the 1920s, when Prohibition was in effect nationally in the United States and parts of Canada.\\r\\nIn more recent years, Canadian officials have complained of drug, cigarette, and firearms smuggling from the United States, while U.S. officials have complained of drug smuggling from Canada.\\r\\nIn July 2005, law enforcement personnel arrested three men who had built a 360-foot (110?m) tunnel under the border between British Columbia and Washington that they intended to use for smuggling marijuana, the first such tunnel known on this border.[22]\\r\\nCornwall, Ontario, experiences ongoing smuggling ÿ mostly of tobacco and firearms from the United States ÿ due to its location. The neighbouring Mohawk territory of Akwesasne straddles the OntarioÿQuebecÿNew York borders, and its First Nations sovereignty prevents Ontario Provincial Police, S?ret du Qubec, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Canadian Coast Guard, United States Border Patrol, United States Coast Guard, and New York State Police from exercising jurisdiction over exchanges taking place within the territory.[23][24]\\r\\nIn late 2006, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a rule regarding new identification requirements for U.S. citizens and international travelers entering the U.S. Implemented on January 23, 2007, this final rule and first phase of the WHTI specifies six forms of identificationone of which is required in order to enter the U.S. by air: a valid passport, a passport card, a state enhanced driver's license (available in Michigan, New York, Vermont, Washington, British Columbia, Manitoba, Minnesota, Ontario, and Quebec[25]) per the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, or trusted traveler program card (NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI); a valid Merchant Mariner Credential when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business; or a valid U.S. military identification card when traveling on official orders.[26][27][28]\\r\\nSince June 2009, every traveller arriving via a land or sea port-of-entry (including ferries) has been required to present one of the above forms of identification to cross the border.\\r\\nFrom west to east:\\r\\nThe U.S. maintains immigration offices, called pre-clearance facilities, in eight Canadian airports with international air service to the United States (Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg). This expedites travel by allowing flights originating in Canada to land at a U.S. airport without being processed as an international arrival. Canada does not maintain equivalent personnel at U.S. airports due to the sheer number of U.S. departure locations with Canadian-bound flights and the limited number of flights compared to the number of U.S.-bound flights that depart major Canadian airports.\\r\\nSimilar arrangements exist at major Canadian seaports that handle sealed direct import shipments into the U.S.\\r\\nAdditionally, at Vancouver's Pacific Central Station, passengers are required to pass through U.S. pre-clearance facilities and pass their baggage through an X-ray before being allowed to board the Seattle-bound Amtrak Cascades train, which makes no further stops before crossing the border. Pre-clearance facilities are not available for the popular New York City to Montreal (Adirondack) or Toronto (Maple Leaf) lines, as these lines have stops between Montreal or Toronto and the border. Instead, passengers must clear customs at a stop located at the actual border.\\r\\nFerry services operate between the province of New Brunswick and the state of Maine, as well as between the province of British Columbia and the states of Washington and Alaska. There are also several ferry services in the Great Lakes operating between the province of Ontario and the states of Michigan, New York, and Ohio. The ferry between Maine and Nova Scotia ended its route in 2009, but resumed operations in 2014.\\r\\nBoldt Castle on Heart Island in the St. Lawrence River has a border control point on the island, but no specific location on the Canadian side.[citation needed] Canadians must present identification to land on the island.\\r\\nOne curiosity on the CanadaÿU.S. border is the presence of six airports that straddle the borderline. The airports were built prior to the U.S. entry into World War II as a way to legally transfer U.S.-built aircraft such as the Lockheed Hudson to Canada under the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. In the interest of maintaining neutrality, U.S. military pilots were forbidden to deliver combat aircraft to Canada. The aircraft were flown to the border, landed, and then at night towed on their wheels over the border by tractors or horses. The next day the planes were crewed by RCAF pilots and flown to other locations, typically airbases in Eastern Canada, from where they were often flown to the United Kingdom and deployed in the Battle of the Atlantic.[29]\\r\\nPiney Pinecreek Border Airport is located in Manitoba and Minnesota. The northwest/southeast-oriented runway straddles the border, and there are two ramps; one in the U.S. and one in Canada. The airport is jointly owned by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the local government of Piney, Manitoba. It is assigned U.S. identifier 48Y and Canadian identifier JX2.\\r\\nInternational Peace Garden Airport is located in Manitoba and North Dakota adjacent to the International Peace Garden. The runway is entirely within North Dakota, but a ramp extends across the border to allow aircraft to access Canadian customs. While not jointly owned, it is operated as an international facility for customs clearance as part of the International Peace Garden.\\r\\nCoronach/Scobey Border Station Airport is located in Saskatchewan and Montana. The eastÿwest runway is sited exactly on the border. The airport is jointly owned by the Canadian and U.S. governments and is assigned U.S. identifier 8U3 and Canadian identifier CKK3.\\r\\nCoutts/Ross International Airport is located in Alberta and Montana. Like Coronach/Scobey, the eastÿwest runway is sited exactly on the border. It is owned entirely by the Montana Aeronautics Division. It is assigned U.S. identifier 7S8 and Canadian identifier CEP4.\\r\\nWhetstone International Airport or Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport is located in Alberta and Montana, and similarly has an eastÿwest runway sited exactly on the border. It is assigned U.S. identifier H28 and Canadian identifier CEQ4.\\r\\nAvey Field State Airport is located in Washington and British Columbia.

Like exclaves, practical exclaves are not contiguous with the land of the home country and have land access only through another country or countries. Unlike exclaves, they are not entirely surrounded by foreign territory. Hence, they are exclaves for practical purposes, without meeting the strict definition.\\r\\nThe term pene-exclave was defined in Robinson (1959) as \\"parts of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently  in particular by wheeled traffic  only through the territory of another country.\\"[34]:283 Pene-exclaves are also called functional exclaves or practical exclaves.[35]:31 Thus, a practical exclave has land borders with other territory but is not completely surrounded by the other's land or territorial waters.[36]:60 Catudal (1974)[37]:113 and Vinokurov (2007)[35]:31ÿ33 further elaborate upon examples, including Point Roberts. \\"Although physical connections by water with Point Roberts are entirely within the sovereignty of the United States, land access is only possible through Canada.\\"[37] Practical exclaves can exhibit continuity of state territory across territorial waters but, nevertheless, a discontinuity on land, such as in the case of Point Roberts.[35]:47","input":"How many canadian provinces border the united states?"},{"output":"John Adams","context":"The Founding Fathers of the United States were those individuals of the Thirteen Colonies in North America who led the American Revolution against the authority of the British Crown in word and deed and contributed to the establishment of the United States of America.[2]\\r\\nHistorian Richard B. Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.[3][4] Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were authors of The Federalist Papers, advocating ratification of the Constitution. The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York (1777) and Massachusetts (1780) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution [5] Jay, Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1783) that would end the American Revolutionary War.[6] Washington was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention. Washington, Jay and Franklin are considered the Founding Fathers of U.S. Intelligence by the CIA.[7] All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States, with Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison serving as President. Jay was the nation's first Chief Justice. Four of these seven - Washington, Jay, Hamilton and Madison - were not signers of the Declaration of Independence.[8]\\r\\nThe term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to the Signers of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.[9] It is not to be confused with the term Framers; the Framers are defined by the National Archives as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States. Of the 55 Framers, only 39 were signers of the Constitution.[10][11] Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include: 1) those who signed the Continental Association, a trade ban and one of the colonists' first collective volleys protesting British control and the Intolerable Acts in 1774 [12] or 2) those who signed the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S. constitutional document.[13]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Founding Fathers\\" is a twentieth-century appellation, coined by Warren G. Harding in 1916.[14] In the 19th century, they were referred to as simply, the \\"Fathers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Continental Congress met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of fifty-six delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies (excluding Georgia) that became the United States of America. Among them was George Washington, who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Also in attendance was Patrick Henry, and John Adams, who like all delegates were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included Samuel Adams from Massachusetts, John Dickinson from Pennsylvania and New York's John Jay. This congress in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the Continental Association to administer boycott actions against Britain.\\r\\nWhen the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.[15] New arrivals included Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, John Hancock of Massachusetts, and John Witherspoon of New Jersey. Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when Peyton Randolph was recalled to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses. Thomas Jefferson replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.[16] The second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the Articles of Confederation and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.[17]\\r\\nThe newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the British Parliament. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the Congress of the Confederation, which met from 1781 to 1789.[18] Later, the Constitutional Convention took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.[19] Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset for some including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the United States Constitution.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th-century U.S. leadership. Almost all of them were well-educated men of means who were leaders in their communities. Many were also prominent in national affairs. Virtually every one had taken part in the American Revolution; at least 29 had served in the Continental Army, most of them in positions of command. Scholars have examined the collective biography of them as well as the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution.[20]\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers attended or held degrees from the colonial colleges, most notably Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, the College of William and Mary, Yale and University of Pennsylvania. Some had previously been home schooled or obtained early instruction from private tutors or academies.[21] Others had studied abroad. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin who had little formal education himself would ultimately establish the University of Pennsylvania based on European models (1740); \\"Penn\\" would have the first medical school (1765) in the thirteen colonies where another Founder, Benjamin Rush would eventually teach.\\r\\nWith a limited number of professional schools established in the U.S., Founders also sought advanced degrees from traditional institutions in England and Scotland such as the University of Edinburgh and University of St. Andrews.\\r\\nSeveral like John Jay, James Wilson, John Williams and George Wythe[25] were trained as lawyers through apprenticeships in the colonies while a few trained at the Inns of Court in London.\\r\\nFranklin, Washington, John Williams and Henry Wisner had little formal education and were largely self-taught or learned through apprenticeship.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers had extensive political experience. Many had been members of the Continental Congress. Nearly all of the 55 Constitutional Convention delegates had experience in colonial and state government, and the majority had held county and local offices.[26]\\r\\nHistorian Caroline Robbins in 1977 examined the status of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence and concluded:\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers practiced a wide range of high and middle-status occupations, and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. They did not differ dramatically from the Loyalists, except they were generally younger and less senior in their professions.[28] A few of them were wealthy or had financial resources that ranged from good to excellent, but there are other founders who were less than wealthy. On the whole they were less wealthy than the Loyalists.[29]\\r\\nFranklin T. Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of the Founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 28 were Anglicans (in the Church of England; or Episcopalian, after the American Revolutionary War was won), 21 were Protestants, and two were Roman Catholics (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons).[32] Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists.[32]\\r\\nA few prominent Founding Fathers were anti-clerical Christians such as Thomas Jefferson,[33][34][35] who constructed the Jefferson Bible, and Benjamin Franklin.[36]\\r\\nHistorian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders (Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington) were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid \\"theistic rationalism\\".[37]\\r\\nThe Faiths of the Founding Fathers is a book that discusses the religion held by the founding fathers, written in 2006 by historian of U.S. religion David L. Holmes.\\r\\nOne of the greatest contradictions of the Founding Fathers was their disunity with regard to slavery at a time that they were seeking liberty for themselves. In her study of Thomas Jefferson, historian Annette Gordon-Reed emphasizes this irony, \\"Others of the founders held slaves, but no other founder drafted the charter for freedom, \\"[38] In addition to Jefferson, George Washington, John Jay and many other of the Founding Fathers practiced slavery but were also conflicted by the institution which many saw as immoral and politically divisive.[39] Benjamin Franklin owned slaves (though Franklin later became an abolitionist).[40] John Jay would try unsuccessfully to abolish slavery as early as 1777 in the State of New York but was overruled (though he would later sign the Gradual Emancipation Act into law while Governor).[41] Alexander Hamilton opposed slavery, as his experiences in life left him very familiar with slavery and its effect on slaves and on slaveholders,[42] although he did negotiate slave transactions for his wife's family, the Schuylers.[43] John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Paine never owned slaves [44]\\r\\nSlaves and slavery are mentioned only indirectly in the 1787 Constitution. For example, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 prescribes that \\"three fifths of all other Persons\\" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and direct taxes. Additionally, in Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3, slaves are referred to as \\"persons held in service or labor\\".[40][45] The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.[45] In 1782 Virginia passed a manumission law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.[46] As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.[46] Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.[45] Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, for lands north of the Ohio River.[45]\\r\\nThe international slave trade was banned in all states except South Carolina, by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave.[47] However, the domestic slave trade was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory.[48]\\r\\nIn the winter and spring of 1786ÿ1787, twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates; for example, Patrick Henry of Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and important than national politics, though during the ratification controversy of 1787ÿ1788 he claimed, \\"I smelled a rat.\\" Rhode Island did not send delegates because of its politicians' suspicions of the Convention delegates' motivations. As the colony was founded by Roger Williams as a sanctuary for Baptists, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.[49]\\r\\nMost of the Founding Fathers married and had children. Many of their spouses, like Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Sarah Livingston Jay, Dolley Madison, Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer were strong women and made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.[50]\\r\\nSherman fathered the largest family: 15 children by two wives. At least nine (Bassett, Brearly, Johnson, Mason, Paterson, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) married more than once. Four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of the delegates also had children conceived illegitimately.[51] George Washington, \\"The Father of our Country,\\"[52] had no biological descendants.\\r\\nThe National Archives and Records Administration also known as NARA, defines U.S. Founding Documents, or Charters of Freedom, as the Declaration of Independence (1776), The Constitution (1787) and the Bill of Rights (1791). These original instruments which represent the philosophy of the United States are housed in Washington, D.C. in the NARA Rotunda.[53] The Library of Congress further identifies the Articles of Confederation, also preserved at NARA, as a primary U.S. document.[54] The Articles of Confederation served as the first constitution of the United States until its replacement by the present Constitution on March 4, 1789.\\r\\nSignatories of the Continental Association (CA), Declaration of Independence (DI), Articles of Confederation (AC), and the United States Constitution (USC)):\\r\\nSubsequent events in the lives of the Founding Fathers after the adoption of the Constitution were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.[55] Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison served in highest U.S. office of President. Jay would be elected to two terms as Governor of New York.\\r\\nSeven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.[50] Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: James Armistead Lafayette was 15, Marquis de Lafayette was 18, Alexander Hamilton was 19, Aaron Burr was 20, Gouverneur Morris and Betsy Ross were 24. The oldest were Benjamin Franklin, 70 and Samuel Whittemore, 81.[56]\\r\\nSecretary Charles Thomson lived to the age of 94. Johnson died at 92. John Adams lived to the age of 90. A few  Franklin, Jay, Jefferson, Madison, Hugh Williamson, and George Wythe  lived into their eighties.

Ellis says \\"the founders\\", or \\"the fathers\\", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s ÿ men like Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C.

The United States Department of the Army, a component of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), controls the cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national cemetery was established during the Civil War on the grounds of Arlington House, which had been the estate of Confederate general Robert E. Lee's wife Mary Anna (Custis) Lee (a great-granddaughter of Martha Washington). The Cemetery, along with Arlington House, Memorial Drive, the Hemicycle, and the Arlington Memorial Bridge, form the Arlington National Cemetery Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 2014.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, the Department of the Army has expanded the cemetery onto public lands and restricted bicycle use within the cemetery. Some of these actions have been controversial.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Washington Parke Custis, grandson of Martha Washington and adopted son of George Washington, acquired the land that now is Arlington National Cemetery in 1802, and began construction of Arlington House, which was ultimately named after the village of Arlington, Gloucestershire, England, where his family was originally from. The estate passed to Custis' daughter, Mary Anna, who had married United States Army officer Robert E. Lee. Custis' will gave a \\"life inheritance\\" to Mary Lee, allowing her to live at and run Arlington Estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it.[4] Upon her death, the Arlington estate passed to her eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Virginia seceded from the Union after the start of the American Civil War at Fort Sumter, Robert E. Lee resigned his commission on April 20, 1861, and took command of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Virginia, later becoming commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.[5] On May 7, troops of the Virginia militia occupied Arlington and Arlington House.[6] With Confederate forces occupying Arlington's high ground, the capital of the Union was left in an untenable military position.[7] Although unwilling to leave Arlington House, Mary Lee believed her estate would soon be recaptured by federal soldiers. So she buried many of her family treasures on the grounds and left for her sister's estate at Ravensworth in Fairfax County, Virginia, on May 14.[8][9] On May 3, General Winfield Scott ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to clear Arlington and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, of all troops not loyal to the United States.[10] McDowell occupied Arlington without opposition on May 24.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, most military personnel who died in battle near Washington, D.C., were buried at the United States Soldiers' Cemetery in Washington, D.C., or Alexandria Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia, but by late 1863 both were nearly full.[12] On July 16, 1862, Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program.[12] In May 1864, Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness. Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area.[12] The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America, and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration.[13] The first military burial at Arlington, for William Henry Christman, was made on May 13, 1864,[14] close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27.[15] However, Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864.[16] Arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981 on July 26, 1948.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government acquired Arlington at a tax sale in 1864 for $26,800, equal to $420,000 today.[18] Mrs. Lee had not appeared in person but rather had sent an agent, attempting to pay the $92.07 in property taxes (equal to $1,400 today) assessed on the estate in a timely manner.[19] The government turned away her agent, refusing to accept the tendered payment. In 1874, Custis Lee, heir under his grandfather's will passing the estate in trust to his mother, sued the United States claiming ownership of Arlington. On December 9, 1882, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5ÿ4 in Lee's favor in United States v. Lee, deciding that Arlington had been confiscated without due process.[19][20] After that decision, Congress returned the estate to him, and on March 3, 1883, Custis Lee sold it back to the government for $150,000 (equal to $3,342,727 in 2018) at a signing ceremony with Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln.[18][21] The land then became a military reservation.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Herbert Hoover conducted the first national Memorial Day ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery, on May 30, 1929.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1863, the federal government used the southern portion of the land now occupied by the cemetery as a settlement for freed slaves, giving the name of \\"Freedmen's Village\\" to the land. The government constructed rental houses that 1,100 to 3,000 freed slaves eventually occupied while farming 1,100 acres (450?ha) of the estate and receiving schooling and occupational training during the Civil War and after War ended.[21][24] However, after the land became part of a military reservation, the government asked the Villagers to leave. When some remained, John A. Commerford, the Superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery, asked the Army's Quartermaster General in 1887 to close the Village on the grounds that people living in the Village had been taking trees at night from the cemetery for use as firewood.[22][25] The Quartermaster General and the Secretary of War then approved Commerford's request.[22] The last of the Village's residents departed after the 56th United States Congress appropriated $75,000 in 1900 to settle the government's debts to them.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith limited space but large numbers of World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and other veterans dying and wanting to be buried at Arlington, the need for additional burial space at the cemetery became a pressing issue. In 1991, Cemetery superintendent John C. Metzler, Jr., implemented a $1.4 million plan to clear a former 13-acre (5.3?ha) parking lot to create space for about 9,000 new grave sites.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cemetery received the authority to transfer 12 acres (4.9?ha) of woodland from the NPS-controlled Arlington House in 1996[27][28] and 2001,[29][30] 37 acres (15?ha) of land in 1999 from the DoD that was the site of the Navy Annex building,[31][32] 8 acres (3.2?ha) of land in 1999 from the Department of the Army that was part of Fort Myer,[31][33] 4 acres (1.6?ha) of land from Arlington County's Southgate Road right-of-way in 2004,[34] and just under 10 acres (4.0?ha) of land from Fort Myer in 2005.[29][35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Metzler implemented the Millennium Project, a $35 million expansion plan to begin utilizing the Arlington woodland, Fort Myer, and Navy Annex land. The project also included converting 40 acres (16?ha) of unused space and 4 acres (16,000?m2) of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 inurnments. The Millennium Project expanded the cemetery's physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s, and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the American Civil War.[35] Several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized Metzler's plans, as did the NPS and the manager of Arlington House.[35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 26, 2013, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113-6) appropriated to the DoD $84 million to plan, design and construct the Millennium Project.[38] The legislation additionally appropriated to the DoD $19 million to study, plan and design a future expansion of the cemetery's burial space.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, a Congressional proposal to expand the cemetery onto land that the Navy Annex and Fort Myer then occupied led to concerns that Arlington County officials had not been properly consulted, leading to the withdrawal of the proposal.[39] However, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65), which was enacted into law during October 1999, subsequently required the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Secretary of the Army administrative jurisdiction of the 36 acres (15?ha) Navy Annex property. The Act required the Secretary of Defense to demolish the Annex's buildings and prepare the property for use as part of the cemetery, while requiring the Secretary of the Army to incorporate the Annex property into the cemetery.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2013, the County Manager of Arlington County, Virginia, and the Executive Director of the Army National Military Cemeteries (consisting of Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery)[40] signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Arlington County Board and the Department of the Army to expand the cemetery even further. Under the tentative plan, Arlington County would give up the easement for Southgate Road (which lies between the Navy Annex property and the cemetery's 2012 boundary), and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the Navy Annex site for a new Southgate Road. In exchange, the Department of Defense would give the Navy Annex parking lot to the county.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army would also transfer land west of South Joyce Street to Columbia Pike to Arlington County. Additionally, the Commonwealth of Virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the Virginia Department of Transportation land bounded by South Joyce Street, Columbia Pike, and South Washington Boulevard. The cloverleaf interchange between Columbia Pike and S. Washington Blvd. would be eliminated, and the hairpin turn in Columbia Pike straightened, to provide a safer, more natural exit from S. Washington Blvd. onto Columbia Pike. Although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the Commonwealth of Virginia's cooperation, the MOU if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in December 2016, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328) authorized the Secretary of the Army to expand the cemetery by acquiring from Arlington County and the Commonwealth of Virginia by condemnation and other means properties near the cemetery that contain the Southgate Road, South Joyce Street and Washington Boulevard right-of-ways, including the Washington Boulvard-Columbia Pike interchange.[42] The Army then informed the Arlington County government in June 2017 that the Army would no longer pursue a land exchange with the County. The Army told the County that the Army would use the entire Navy Annex site to expand the cemetery and would acquire for the cemetery about 5 acres (2.0?ha) of public land that Arlington County then owned. The Army would also acquire for the cemetery expansion about 7 acres (2.8?ha) of land located between Columbia Pike and Interstate 395 that the Commonwealth of Virginia then owned.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 22, 1995, officials of the United States Department of the Interior and the United States Department of the Army signed an agreement to transfer from Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, to the Army a part of Arlington Woods, which was located in Section 29 of the NPS at Arlington National Cemetery between Arlington House and Fort Myer.[44] The property transfer, which involved 12 acres (4.9?ha) of NPS land, was intended to permit Metzler to start expanding the cemetery beyond its existing boundaries.[28][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironmentalists expressed concerns that the agreement would result in the partial destruction of the 24-acre (9.7?ha) remnant of a historically important stand of native trees.[37][46] A historical marker near the woodland notes that, while visiting Arlington House in 1825, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette had warned Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis, the wife of George Washington Parke Custis: \\"Cherish these forest trees around your mansion. Recollect how much easier it is to cut a tree than to make one grow.\\" The marker further notes that the Virginia Native Plant Society had recognized the woodland as being one of the best examples of old growth terraced gravel forest remaining in Virginia.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 23, 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104-201) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army all of the land in Section 29 that was within an \\"Arlington National Cemetery Interment Zone\\" and some of the land in the Section that was within a \\"Robert E. Lee Memorial Preservation Zone\\".[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 5, 1998, the NPS, which is a component of the Department of the Interior, informed the National Capital Planning Commission that it wanted to transfer only 4 acres (1.6?ha) to the cemetery, rather than the 12 acres (4.9?ha) that the 1995 agreement had described. In response, Metzler stated: \\"I was surprised. But we will continue to work with the Department of Interior and see what happens.\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 12, 1999, the NPS issued a Federal Register notice that announced the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) for the transfer.[45][48] The EA stated that the Interment Zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in Arlington County. This forest was the same type that once covered the Arlington estate, and had regenerated from trees that were present historically. A forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old. The Interment Zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources, in addition to those in the Preservation Zone.[48] The EA described four alternative courses of action.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to the NPS's March 1998 statement to the National Capital Planning Commission, the 1999 EA stated that the preferred alternative (Alternative 1) would transfer to the cemetery approximately 9.6 acres (3.9?ha), comprising most of the Interment Zone and the northern tip of the Preservation Zone.[48] Another alternative (Alternative 3) would transfer to the cemetery the 12 acres (4.9?ha) Interment Zone, while keeping the 12.5 acres (5.1?ha) Preservation Zone under NPS jurisdiction.[48] The EA concluded: \\"Public Law 104-201 directed the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army jurisdiction over the Interment Zone, which is the plan in Alternative 3. Adoption of any of the other alternatives would require legislative action to amend the existing law.\\"[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 28, 2001, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107) repealed the \\"obsolete\\" part of Public Law 104-201 that had authorized the transfer of portions of Section 29 to the Secretary of the Army.[30] The new legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Secretary of the Army within 30 days the approximately 12 acres (4.9?ha) Interment Zone.[30] The transfer therefore involved the entire 12 acres (4.9?ha) of NPS land that the 1995 agreement and Alternative 3 in the 1999 EA had described.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2001 legislation required the Secretary of the Army to use the Interment Zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium.[30] In addition, the legislation required the Secretary of the Interior to manage the remainder of Section 29 \\"in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee Memorial.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 12, 2012, the United States Army Corps of Engineers asked for comments on a draft EA that described a further expansion of Arlington National Cemetery as part of the Millennium Project.[49][50][51] The 2012 draft EA was intended to implement conversion into burial space of the 17 acres (6.9?ha) of Ft. Myer grounds as well as 10 acres (4.0?ha) of Section 29 woodland. The draft EA described seven alternatives. The preferred alternative (Alternative E) called for the removal of about one-half of the 1,700 trees with a diameter of 6 inches (15?cm) or greater on the site. About 640 of the trees were within a 135-year-old portion of Arlington Woods.[52] The draft EA concluded: \\"Based on the evaluation of environmental impacts....., no significant impacts would be expected from the Proposed Action; therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared and a Finding of No Significant Impact will be prepared and signed.\\"[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 12, 2013, the Corps of Engineers released a revised EA for the Millennium Project.[53][54] The revised EA contained copies of a number of public comments on the draft EA that had criticized the project and parts of the EA while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere.[55] However, the Department of Forestry of the Commonwealth of Virginia found that, based on information in the draft EA, the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the Commonwealth's forest resources.[56] The revised EA did not change the preferred alternative (Alternative E) or the Army's plans to prepare and sign the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) that the draft EA had described.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 5, 2013, after reviewing 100 public comments that it had received on the revised EA, the Corps of Engineers released a final EA and a signed FONSI for the Millennium Project.[58][59] The Final EA and the FONSI retained Alternative E as the preferred alternative.[58] The final EA stated that, of the 905 trees to be removed, 771 trees were healthy native trees that had diameters between 6 and 41 inches.[60][61] The project would remove approximately 211 trees from a less than 2.63 acres (1.06?ha) area containing a portion of a 145-year-old forest that stood within the property boundaries of a historic district that a National Register of Historic Places nomination form for Arlington House had described in 1966.[60][62] About 491 trees would be removed from an area of trees that was approximately 105 years old.[60] Approximately 203 trees with ages of 50 to 145 years would be removed from a former picnic area.[60] At a public hearing on July 11, 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the site and building plans for the Millennium Project.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 9, 2010, United States Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh reprimanded the cemetery's superintendent, John C. Metzler, Jr., and his deputy, Thurman Higgenbotham, after a DOD inspector general's report revealed that cemetery officials had placed the wrong headstones on tombs, buried coffins in shallow graves, and buried bodies on top of one another.[64] Metzler, who had already announced his intention to retire on July 2, 2010, admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement.[64] The investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by \\"dysfunctional management, lack of established policy and procedures, and an overall unhealthy organizational climate.\\"[65][66] Both Metzler and Higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2011, as a result of the problems discovered, Kathryn Condon, the recently appointed Executive Director of the Army National Military Cemeteries, announced that the cemetery's staff had been increased from 102 to 159. She added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because, \\"They didn't have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals, which also proved controversial. Until 2005, the cemetery's administration gave free access, with the family's permission, to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery. According to the Washington Post in 2008, the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the cemetery's management controversy began to end, the Army appointed Patrick K. Hallinan the acting superintendent of the cemetery in June 2010. He was promoted permanently to the position in October 2010. Hallinan had previously worked for the Office of Field Programs in the National Cemetery Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs. In that capacity, Hallinan had oversight of 131 national cemeteries, national cemetery policy, procedures, and operations.[70] Hallinan was promoted to Executive Director of the Army National Military Cemeteries upon the retirement of Kathryn Condon in spring 2014.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014, Hallinan stepped down and was replaced by Jack E. Lechner, Jr. as superintendent of the cemetery. Lechner had been a funeral director for 10 years in the private sector before joining the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of colonel (retiring in November 2011), having spent 2008 to 2010 as chief of the Supply Division of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, overseeing the equipping of Iraqi and Afghanistan national security forces. Since June 2010, he had served as executive officer and deputy superintendent of the cemetery under Hallinan.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army removed Lechner as superintendent of the cemetery in early August 2015 after a performance review \\"called into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader\\". The Army declined to elaborate further and appointed Hallinan to be the temporary Cemetery superintendent until the Army could find a successor.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, the Morrill Worcester wreath company in Harrington, Maine, had a surplus at the end of the holiday season. Recalling a boyhood trip to the cemetery, Worcester donated to the cemetery 5,000 wreaths to honor the cemetery's dead, with the help of volunteers and a local trucking company. After thirteen years of similar donations, in 2005 a photo of snowy gravestones covered with wreaths at the cemetery received widespread circulation on the Internet. Thousands of people called Worcester, wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, over 150 different locations simultaneously held ceremonies with Arlington's. Additionally, the project had its first \\"Veterans Honor Parade\\" with \\"Patriot Guard Riders\\" who escorted the wreaths from Maine to the cemetery. The parade, which is held each year, now visits schools, monuments, veterans' homes and communities along its route.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 2006, Worcester's company supplied wreaths to over 230 state and national cemeteries and veterans monuments across the country.[74] Assisted by veterans and truckers, Worcester established in 2007 a nonprofit organization named \\"Wreaths Across America\\".[73] In December 2008, the United States Senate agreed to a resolution that designated December 13, 2008, as \\"Wreaths Across America Day\\".[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, volunteers placed over 700,000 memorial wreaths at 1,000 locations in the United States and overseas, including the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, Bunker Hill, Valley Forge, and the National September 11 Memorial at the World Trade Center site in New York City. During that year, volunteers were able to place wreaths in all sections of the cemetery for the first time.[73] In 2016, this number increased to 1.2 million wreaths being placed at more than 1,230 cemeteries across the nation.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nConflict of interest charges have been made against Wreaths Across America because this charity has an exclusive for-profit supplier, Worcester Wreath Company, also run by the Morrill family in the same town. The charity's purchases of wreaths from this company account for most of the company's revenue and profits. In late 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported serious conflicts of interest with potential malfeasance in governance and contracting.[77] In 2015 alone the Journal reported profits of over $1 million on sales of over 850,000 wreaths to the charity raising concerns about competitive bidding, reporting that several competitors had asked to bid significantly below the price offered by Worcester Wreath Company but were denied access.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring May and June 2014, the cemetery celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding with a month-long series of events, tours, and lectures.[78] During these celebrations, cemetery officials formally re-designated the Old Amphitheater as the James Tanner Amphitheater. James R. Tanner was a Union Army officer who lost both legs during the war. He later became a War Department stenographer, and recorded much of the early evidence in the investigation into the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He later was active in the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union Army veterans group. Tanner is buried a few yards from the amphitheater.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cemetery is divided into 70 sections, with some sections in the southeast and western part of the cemetery reserved for future expansion.[80] Section 60, in the southeast part of the cemetery, is the burial ground for military personnel killed in the Global War on Terror since 2001.[81] Section 21, also known as the Nurses Section, is the area of Arlington National Cemetery where many nurses are buried and is the site of the SpanishÿAmerican War Nurses Memorial and the Nurses Memorial.[82] Another sectionChaplains Hillincludes monuments to Jewish, Protestant, and Roman Catholic military chaplains.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, Confederate soldiers buried at the Soldiers' Home and various locations within Arlington were reinterred in a Confederate section that was authorized by Congress in 1900. On June 4, 1914, the United Daughters of the Confederacy dedicated the Confederate Memorial designed by Moses Ezekiel. Upon his death in 1917, Ezekiel was buried at the base of the monument as he was a veteran of the Confederate army.[83] All Confederate headstones in this section are peaked rather than rounded.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 3,800 former slaves, called \\"Contrabands\\" during the Civil War, are buried in Section 27. Their headstones are designated with the word \\"Civilian\\" or \\"Citizen\\".[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Department of Veterans Affairs oversees the National Cemetery Administration's orders[86] for placement of inscriptions and faith emblems at no charge to the estate of the deceased, submitted with information provided by the next of kin[87] that is placed on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers. The Department of Veterans Affairs currently offers 63 authorized faith emblems for placement on markers to represent the deceased's faith.[88] This number has grown in recent years due to legal challenges to policy.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2007, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) did not allow the use of the pentacle as an \\"emblem of belief\\" on tombstones in military cemeteries. This policy was changed following an out-of-court settlement on April 23 following a series of lawsuits by the family of Patrick Stewart against the VA.[90][91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 2001, privately purchased markers were permitted in the cemetery. The sections in which the cemetery permitted such markers are nearly filled and the cemetery generally does not allow new burials in these sections.[93] Nevertheless, the older sections of the cemetery have a wide variety of private markers placed prior to 2001, including an artillery piece.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 32 Commonwealth war dead burials and some headstones are Commonwealth War Graves Commission style.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tomb of the Unknowns is part of the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. The Memorial Amphitheater has hosted state funerals and Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies. Ceremonies are also held for Easter. About 5,000 people attend these holiday ceremonies each year. The structure is mostly built of Imperial Danby marble from Vermont. The Memorial Display room, between the amphitheater and the Tomb of the Unknowns, uses Botticino stone, imported from Italy. The amphitheater was the result of a campaign by Ivory Kimball to construct a place to honor America's servicemen/women. Congress authorized the structure on March 4, 1913. Woodrow Wilson laid the cornerstone for the building on October 15, 1915. The cornerstone contained 15 items including a Bible and a copy of the Constitution.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater was completed in 1921, important ceremonies were held at what is now known as the \\"Old Amphitheater.\\" This structure sits where Robert E. Lee once had his gardens. The amphitheater was built in 1868 under the direction of Civil War General John A. Logan. Gen. James A. Garfield was the featured speaker at the Decoration Day dedication ceremony, May 30, 1868, later being elected as President of the United States 1881. The amphitheater has an encircling colonnade with a latticed roof that once supported a web of vines. The amphitheater has a marble dais, known as \\"the rostrum\\", which is inscribed with the U.S. national motto found on the Great Seal of the United States, E pluribus unum (\\"Out of many, one\\"). The rostrum was designed by General Montgomery C. Meigs, then Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army.[96] The amphitheater seats 1,500 people and has hosted speakers such as William Jennings Bryan.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier stands on top of a hill overlooking Washington, D.C. One of the more well-attended sites at the cemetery, the tomb is made from Yule marble quarried in Colorado. It consists of seven pieces, with a total weight of 79 short tons (72 metric tons). The tomb was completed and opened to the public April 9, 1932, at a cost of $48,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was initially named the \\"Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\\" Other unknown servicemen were later entombed there, and it became known as the \\"Tomb of the Unknowns\\", though it has never been officially named. The soldiers entombed there are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tomb of the Unknowns has been perpetually guarded since July 2, 1937, by the U.S. Army. The 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (\\"The Old Guard\\") began guarding the Tomb on April 6, 1948. There is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the graves.[98] The Tomb Guard:\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter each turn, the Guard executes a sharp \\"shoulder-arms\\" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the Guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowedthe 21-gun salute.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach turn the guard makes precise movements and followed by a loud click of the heels as he snaps them together. The guard is changed every half-hour during daylight in the summer, and every hour during daylight in the winter and every two hours at night (when the cemetery is closed to the public), regardless of weather conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA commemorative stamp was issued on November 11, 1922, the first anniversary of the first entombment picturing the Amphitheater. It encompasses the original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of an unidentified WW I American soldier was entombed on Armistice Day, November 11, 1921, later covered in 1931 by a more elaborate marble sarcophagus.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several memorials on the grounds of the cemetery. However, due to the lack of space for burials and the large amount of space that memorials take up, the U.S. Army now requires a joint or concurrent resolution from Congress before it will place new memorials at Arlington.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the Tomb of the Unknowns stands the USS Maine Mast Memorial, which commemorates the 266 men who lost their lives aboard the USS Maine. The memorial is built around a mast salvaged from the Maine's wreckage. The USS Maine Memorial served as the temporary resting place for foreign heads of state or government, Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines and Ignacy Jan Paderewski of Poland, who died in exile in the United States during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Space Shuttle Challenger Memorial was dedicated on May 20, 1986, in memory of the crew of flight STS-51-L, who died during launch on January 28, 1986. Transcribed on the back of the stone is the text of the John Gillespie Magee, Jr. poem High Flight, which was quoted by then President Ronald Reagan when he addressed the disaster. Although many remains were identified and returned to the families for private burial, some were not, and were laid to rest under the marker. Two crew members, Scobee and Smith, are buried in Arlington. On February 1, 2004, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe dedicated a similar memorial to those who died when the Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry on February 1, 2003.[100] Astronauts Laurel Clark, David Brown and Michael Anderson, who were killed in the Columbia disaster, are also buried in Arlington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lockerbie Cairn is a memorial to the 270 killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The memorial is constructed of 270 stones, one for each person killed in the disaster. In section 64, a memorial to the 184 victims of the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon was dedicated September 11, 2001. The memorial takes the shape of a pentagon, and lists the names of all the victims that were killed. Unidentified remains from the victims are buried beneath it.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 25, 1925, President Calvin Coolidge approved a request to erect a Commonwealth Cross of Sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the USA who lost their lives fighting in the Canadian forces during World War I. The monument was dedicated November 11, 1927 and after the Korean War and World War II the names of US citizens who died in those conflicts were added.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Women in Military Service for America Memorial is adjacent to the Ceremonial Entrance to the cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Laos Memorial, or Lao Veterans of America memorial, dedicated to Lao and Hmong veterans who served with US Special Forces and CIA advisors during the Vietnam War, to defend the Royal Kingdom of Laos from the North Vietnamese invasion of Laos by selling opium to the CIA in exchange for weapons and promises for their own country, is located on Grant Avenue near the eternal flame memorial to U.S. President John F. Kennedy.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, legislation began moving through Congress to approve a \\"Place of Remembrance\\" at the cemetery. The memorial will be an ossuary designed to contain fragments of remains which are unidentifiable through DNA analysis. The remains will be cremated before placement in the memorial.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flags in the cemetery are flown at half-staff from a half-hour before the first funeral until a half hour after the last funeral each day. Funerals are normally conducted five days a week, excluding weekends.[104][105]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunerals, including interments and inurnments, average between 27ÿ30 per day. The Cemetery conducts approximately 6,900 burials each year.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith more than 400,000 interments,[1] the cemetery has the second-largest number of burials of any national cemetery in the United States. The largest of the 130 national cemeteries is the Calverton National Cemetery, on Long Island, near Riverhead, New York, which conducts more than 7,000 burials each year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to in-ground burial, the cemetery also has one of the larger columbaria for cremated remains in the country. Four courts are currently in use, each with 5,000 niches. When construction is complete, there will be nine courts with a total of 50,000 niches; capacity for 100,000 remains. Any honorably discharged veteran is eligible for inurnment in the columbarium, if s/he served on active duty at some point in her/his career (other than for training).[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nPart 553 (Army National Military Cemeteries) of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) establishes regulations for the cemetery, including eligibility for interment (ground burial) and inurnment.[107] Due to limited space, the criteria for ground burial eligibility are more restrictive than at other national cemeteries, as well as more restrictive than for inurnment in the columbarium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe persons specified below are eligible for ground burial in the cemetery, unless otherwise prohibited.[108] The last period of active duty of former members of the armed forces must have ended honorably. Interment may be of casketed or cremated remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue at least partly to the lack of space at the cemetery for ground burial, standards for inurnment (burial of cremated remains) in the columbarium are currently much less restrictive than for ground burial at the cemetery. In general, any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty (other than for training) and whose last service terminated honorably is eligible for inurnment. Eligibility for inurnment is described fully in 32 C.F.R.  553.15a.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress has from time to time created prohibited categories of persons that, even if otherwise eligible for burial, lose that eligibility. One such prohibition is against certain persons who are convicted of committing certain state or federal capital crimes, as defined in 38 U.S. Code  2411. Capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute, and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence (with or without parole). The reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent Timothy McVeigh from being eligible at Arlington National Cemetery, but it has since been amended to prevent others.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso prohibited under the same statute are those determined, with clear and convincing evidence, to have avoided such conviction by death or flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first soldier to be buried in Arlington was Private William Henry Christman of Pennsylvania on May 13, 1864.[110] There are 396 Medal of Honor recipients buried in Arlington National Cemetery,[111] nine of whom are Canadian.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive state funerals have been held at Arlington: those of Presidents William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy, his two brothers, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Edward \\"Ted\\" Kennedy, and General of the Armies John J. Pershing. Whether or not they were wartime service members, U.S. presidents are eligible to be buried at Arlington, since they oversaw the armed forces as commanders-in-chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most frequently visited sites in the cemetery is the grave of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who is buried nearby along with their son Patrick and their stillborn daughter Arabella. Kennedy's remains were interred there on March 14, 1967, a reinterment from his original Arlington burial site, some 20 feet (6.1?m) away, where he was buried in November 1963. The grave is marked with an \\"eternal flame\\". The remains of his brothers, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. \\"Ted\\" Kennedy, are buried nearby. The latter two graves are marked with simple crosses and footstones. On December 1, 1971, Robert Kennedy's body was re-interred 100 feet (30?m) from its original June 1968 burial site.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of the astronauts who were killed in January 27, 1967 flash fire inside the Apollo 1 Command Module, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee, are buried at the cemetery. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and a longtime U.S. Senator from Ohio, was buried at the cemetery in April 2017.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish Diplomat and Field Marshal Sir John Dill was buried at the cemetery when he died in Washington D.C. during World War II.[113] He became the first non-american to be buried at this cemetery.[114] The equestrian statue on Dill's grave is one of only two such statues at the cemetery; the other is Major General Philip Kearny's.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cemetery has within recent years announced policies and procedures that limit visitor access to the cemetery's grounds. The Cemetery's executive director has stated that some of these may create delays for visitors. Some have become controversial.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 6, 2013, Patrick Hallinan, Executive Director, Army National Military Cemeteries, issued an official memorandum that contained the cemetery's then-current bicycle use policy.[116][117] The memorandum permitted cyclists to travel in only one direction on only one route unless otherwise authorized by the executive director.[117] This \\"White Line\\" route traveled from the Old Post Chapel gate at Joint Base MyerÿHenderson Hall towards the main entrance of the cemetery at Memorial Avenue, using Meigs Drive, Sherman Drive and Schley Drive.[117] The memorandum stated without explanation: \\"Bicycle traffic will not be permitted to travel in the reverse direction.\\"[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nCyclists could only use this route between 8:00?a.m. and 6:45?p.m. from April 1 to September 30 and between 8:00?a.m. and 4:45?p.m. from October 1 to March 31.[117] Cyclists had to wear bicycle helmets that certain designated organizations had approved.[117] Bicycles had to be equipped with headlights, tail lights or red reflectors in lieu of tail lights, regardless of the time of travel.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 11, 2016, the Department of the Army published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would, among other things, prohibit a visitor to an Army National Military Cemetery (Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery) from riding a bicycle without first acquiring a pass to visit a relative's gravesite or columbarium niche.[118] After receiving 13 comments from 13 individuals concerning the use of bicycles in the cemetery (including comments from representatives of the Arlington County Board and local bicycle advocacy groups that opposed the new restrictions), the Department of the Army published a final rule in the Federal Register on September 26, 2016, that implemented the proposed rule, effective October 26, 2016.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with the final rule, the cemetery issued a new bicycle use policy, effective October 26, 2016. The policy stated that bicycling would no longer be allowed on Cemetery grounds without a family pass. The policy further stated that \\"bicyclists traversing the cemetery grounds do impact funeral services and the experience that families expect and deserve as they visit their loved one's grave. ... As there are no bike paths on the cemetery grounds, mixing cyclists with pedestrians and vehicles creates a safety hazard.\\"[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2016, Hallinan announced that the cemetery was increasing security measures for its visitors. In addition to random identification checks and other security measures already in place, the cemetery will require pedestrians to enter at set access points: the main entrance on Memorial Avenue, the Ord and Weitzel gate, and the Old Post Chapel gate at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. Before entering the cemetery through its main entrance, all pedestrians will be screened through the cemetery's Welcome Center. All vehicle access will require presenting valid, government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, when entering the cemetery.

Hallinan stated that these processes may result in delays when entering the cemetery.[121]","input":"Who was the first person to be buried at arlington national cemetery?"},{"output":"St. Augustine","context":"St. Augustine (Spanish: San Agustn) is a city in the Southeastern United States, on the Atlantic coast of northeastern Florida. Founded in 1565 by Spanish explorers, it is the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement within the borders of the continental United States.[7]\\r\\nThe county seat of St. Johns County,[8] St. Augustine is part of Florida's First Coast region and the Jacksonville metropolitan area. According to the 2010 census, the city population was 12,975. The United States Census Bureau's 2013 estimate of the city's population was 13,679, while the urban area had a population of 71,379 in 2012.[9]\\r\\nSt. Augustine was founded on September 8, 1565, by Spanish admiral Pedro Menndez de Avils, Florida's first governor. He named the settlement \\"San Agustn\\", as his ships bearing settlers, troops, and supplies from Spain had first sighted land in Florida eleven days earlier on August 28, the feast day of St. Augustine.[10] The city served as the capital of Spanish Florida for over 200 years. It was designated as the capital of British East Florida when the territory briefly changed hands between Spain and Britain.\\r\\nSpain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819, and St. Augustine was designated the capital of the Florida Territory upon ratification of the Adams-Ons Treaty in 1821. The Florida National Guard made the city its headquarters that same year. The territorial government moved and made Tallahassee the capital in 1824. Since the late 19th century, St. Augustine's distinct historical character has made the city a major tourist attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 1565 by the Spanish conquistador, Pedro Menndez de Avils, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin in the contiguous United States. In 1562, a group of Huguenots led by Jean Ribault arrived in Spanish Florida to establish a colony in the territory claimed by Spain. They explored the mouth of the St. Johns River, calling it la Rivire de Mai (the River May), then sailed northward and established a settlement called Charlesfort at Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina. Spain learned of this French expedition through its spies at ports on the Atlantic coast of France. The Huguenot nobleman Ren de Laudonnire, who had participated in the expedition, returned to Florida in 1564 with three ships and 300 Huguenot colonists. He arrived at the mouth of the River May on June 22, 1564, sailed up it a few miles, and founded Fort Caroline.\\r\\nDesiring to protect its claimed territories in North America against such incursions, the Spanish Crown issued an asiento to Menndez, signed by King Philip II on March 20, 1565, granting him expansive trade privileges, the power to distribute lands, and licenses to sell 500 slaves, as well as various titles, including that of adelantado of Florida.[11] This contract directed Menndez to sail for La Florida, reconnoitre it from the Florida Keys to present-day Canada, and report on its coastal features, with a view to establishing a permanent settlement for the defense of the Spanish treasure fleet. He was ordered as well to drive away any intruders who were not subjects of the Spanish crown.[12]\\r\\nOn July 28, Menndez set sail from Cdiz with a fleet led by his 600-ton flagship, the San Pelayo, accompanied by several smaller ships, and carrying over 1,000 sailors, soldiers, and settlers.[13] On the feast day of St. Augustine, August 28, the fleet sighted land and anchored off the north inlet of the tidal channel the French called the River of Dolphins.[14] Menndez then sailed north and confronted Ribault's fleet outside the bar of the River May in a brief skirmish. On September 6, he returned to the site of his first landfall, naming it after the Catholic saint, disembarked his troops, and quickly constructed fortifications to protect his people and supplies.[15][16]\\r\\nMenndez then marched his soldiers overland for a surprise attack on Fort Caroline, where they killed almost everyone in the fort except for the women and children. Jean Ribault had already put out to sea with his ships for an assault on St. Augustine, but was surprised by a storm that wrecked his ships further south. Informed by his Indian allies that the survivors were walking northward on the coast, Menndez began to search for the Frenchmen, who had made it as far as the banks of the Matanzas River's south entrance.[17] There they were confronted by the Spaniard and his men on the opposite side. After several parleys with the Spanish, Jean Ribault and the Frenchmen with him (between 150ÿ350, sources differ) surrendered; almost all of them were executed in the dunes near the inlet, thereafter called Matanzas (Spanish for \\"slaughters\\").[18]\\r\\nIn May 1566, as relations with the neighboring Timucua Indians deteriorated, Menndez moved the Spanish settlement to a more defensible position on the north end of the barrier island between the mainland and the sea, and built a wooden fort there. In 1572, the settlement was relocated to the mainland, in the area just south of the future town plaza. Confident that he had fulfilled the primary conditions of his contract with the King, including the building of forts along the coast of La Florida, Menndez returned to Spain in 1567. After several more transatlantic crossings, Menndez fell ill and died on September 17, 1574.[19]\\r\\nSucceeding governors of the province maintained a peaceful coexistence with the local Native Americans, allowing the isolated outpost of St. Augustine some stability for a few years. On May 28 and 29, 1586, soon after the Anglo-Spanish War began between England and Spain, the English privateer Sir Francis Drake sacked and burned St. Augustine.[20] The approach of his large fleet obliged Governor Pedro Menndez Mrquez and the townspeople to flee for their safety. When the English got ashore, they seized some artillery pieces and a royal strongbox containing gold ducats, the garrison payroll.[21] The killing of their sergeant major by the Spanish rearguard caused Drake to order the town burnt.[22][23]\\r\\nIn 1609 and 1611, expeditions were sent out from St. Augustine against the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia.[24] In the second half of the 17th century, unsettled groups of Indians, forced southward by the expanding English colony in Carolina, made raids into Florida and killed the Franciscan priests who served at the Catholic missions. Requests by successive governors of the province to strengthen the presidios garrison and fortifications were ignored by the Crown. The charter of 1663 for the new Province of Carolina, issued by King Charles II of England, was revised in 1665, claiming lands as far southward as 29 degrees north latitude, about 65 miles south of the existing settlement at St. Augustine.[25][26]\\r\\nThe English buccaneer Robert Searle then sacked St. Augustine in 1668, killing sixty people and pillaging government buildings, churches and houses,[27] after which his pirates ransomed off some of their hostages and sold others into slavery. This raid and the establishment of the English settlement at Charles Town spurred the Spanish monarchy to finally acknowledge the threat represented by the new English colonies to the north and strengthen the city's defenses. In 1669, Queen Regent Mariana ordered the Viceroy of New Spain to disburse funds for the construction of a permanent masonry fortress, which began in 1672.[28] The Castillo de San Marcos was completed in 1695, not long before an attack by Governor Moore's forces from Carolina in November, 1702. Failing to take the fort after a siege of 58 days, the British troops burned St. Augustine to the ground as they retreated.[29] In 1740, the town was again besieged, this time by the governor of the British colony of Georgia, General James Oglethorpe, who was also unable to take the fort.[30]\\r\\nThe Treaty of Paris (1763), signed after Great Britain's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War, ceded Florida to Great Britain and consequently St. Augustine became a Loyalist haven during the American Revolutionary War.[31] The second Treaty of Paris (1783), which recognized the independence of the former British colonies north of Florida, also ceded Florida back to Spain, and as a result many of the town's Spanish citizens returned to St Augustine. Refugees from Dr. Andrew Turnbull's troubled colony in New Smyrna had fled to St. Augustine in 1777, and made up the majority of the city's population during British rule. This group was, and still is, referred to locally as \\"Menorcans\\", even though it also included settlers from Italy, Corsica and the Greek islands as well.[32][33]\\r\\nDuring the Second Spanish period (1784-1821) of Florida, Spain was dealing with invasions of the Iberian peninsula by Napoleon's armies in the Peninsular War, and struggled to maintain a tenuous hold on its territories in the western hemisphere as revolution swept South America. The royal administration of Florida was neglected, as the province had long been regarded as an unprofitable backwater by the Crown. The United States, however, considered Florida vital to its political and military interests as it expanded its territory in North America, and maneuvered by sometimes clandestine means to acquire it.[34] The AdamsÿOns Treaty, negotiated in 1819 and ratified in 1821, ceded Florida and St. Augustine, still its capital at the time, to the United States.[35]\\r\\nFlorida remained an organized territory of the United States until 1845, when it was admitted into the Union as the State of Florida.[36] The Territorial Period (1821-1845) was marked by protracted wars with the Creek Indian groups who occupied the peninsula, collectively known as \\"Seminoles\\", during the Second Seminole War (1835-1842). The United States Army took command of the Castillo de San Marcos and renamed it Fort Marion after General Francis Marion, who fought in the American Revolutionary War. The capital of the territory was moved to Tallahassee in 1824.\\r\\nFlorida joined the Confederacy after the Civil War began in 1861, and Confederate authorities remained in control of St. Augustine for fourteen months, although it was barely defended. The Union conducted a blockade of shipping. In 1862 Union troops gained control of St. Augustine and controlled it through the rest of the war. With the economy already suffering, many residents fled.[37][38]\\r\\nHenry Flagler, a co-founder with John D. Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Company, spent the winter of 1883 in St. Augustine and found the city charming, but considered its hotels and transportation systems inadequate.[39] He had the idea to make St. Augustine a winter resort for wealthy Americans from the north, and to bring them south he bought several short line railroads and combined these in 1885 to form the Florida East Coast Railway. He built a railroad bridge over the St. Johns River in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development.[40][41]\\r\\nFlagler began construction in 1887 on two large ornate hotels in the city, the 540-room Ponce de Leon Hotel and the 250-room Hotel Alcazar. The next year, he purchased the Casa Monica Hotel across the street from both the Alcazar and the Ponce de Leon. His chosen architectural firm, Carrre and Hastings, radically altered the appearance of St. Augustine with these hotels, giving it a skyline and beginning an architectural trend in the state characterized by the use of the Moorish Revival style. With the opening of the Ponce de Leon in 1888, St. Augustine became the winter resort of American high society for a few years.[42]\\r\\nWhen Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad was extended southward to Palm Beach and then Miami in the early 20th Century, the rich mostly abandoned St. Augustine. Wealthy vacationers began to customarily spend their winters in South Florida, where the climate was warmer and freezes were rare. St. Augustine nevertheless still attracted tourists, and eventually became a destination for families traveling in automobiles as new highways were built and Americans took to the road for annual summer vacations. The tourist industry soon became the dominant sector of the local economy.[43]\\r\\nIn late 1963, nearly a decade after the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation of schools was unconstitutional, African Americans were still trying to get St. Augustine to integrate the public schools in the city. They were also trying to integrate public accommodations, such as lunch counters,[44] and were met with arrests[45] and Ku Klux Klan violence.[46][47] Local college students held non-violent protests throughout the city, including sit-ins at the local Woolworth's, picket lines, and marches through the downtown. These protests were often met with police violence. Homes of African Americans were firebombed,[48] black leaders were assaulted and threatened with death, and others were fired from their jobs.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1964, St. Augustine civil rights leader Robert Hayling[49] asked the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and its leader Martin Luther King, Jr. for assistance.[50] From May until July 1964, King and Hayling, along with Andrew Young, organized marches, sit-ins, and other forms of peaceful protest in St. Augustine. Hundreds of black and white civil rights supporters were arrested,[51] and the jails were filled to capacity.[52] At the request of Hayling and King, white civil rights supporters from the North, including students, clergy, and well-known public figures, came to St. Augustine and were arrested together with Southern activists.[53][54][55]\\r\\nSt. Augustine was the only place in Florida where King was arrested; his arrest there occurred on June 11, 1964, on the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge's restaurant. The demonstrations came to a climax when a group of black and white protesters jumped into the hotel's segregated swimming pool. In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel & Motel Association, poured what he claimed to be muriatic acid into the pool to burn the protesters. Photographs of this, and of a policeman jumping into the pool to arrest the protesters, were broadcast around the world.\\r\\nThe Ku Klux Klan responded to these protests with violent attacks that were widely reported in national and international media.[56] Popular revulsion against the Klan and police violence in St. Augustine generated national sympathy for the black protesters and became a key factor in Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,[57] leading eventually to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,[58] both of which provided federal enforcement of constitutional rights.\\r\\nIn 1965, St. Augustine celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding,[59] and jointly with the State of Florida, inaugurated a program to restore part of the colonial city. The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was formed to reconstruct more than thirty-six buildings to their historical appearance, which was completed within a few years. When the State of Florida abolished the Board in 1997, the City of St. Augustine assumed control of the reconstructed buildings, as well as other historic properties including the Government House. In 2010, the city transferred control of the historic buildings to the University of Florida.\\r\\nIn 2015, St. Augustine celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding with four-day long festival and a visit from Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia of Spain.[60]\\r\\nOn October 7, 2016 Hurricane Matthew caused widespread flooding in downtown St. Augustine.[61]\\r\\nSt. Augustine is located at 295341N 811852W? / ?29.89472N 81.31444W? / 29.89472; -81.31444 (29.8946910, ?81.3145170).[1] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.7 square miles (27.8?km2), 8.4 square miles (21.7?km2) of which is land and 2.4 square miles (6.1?km2) (21.99%) is water. Access to the Atlantic Ocean is via the St. Augustine Inlet of the Matanzas River.\\r\\nSt. Augustine has a humid subtropical climate or Cfa ÿ typical of the Gulf and South Atlantic states. The low latitude and coastal location give the city a mostly warm and sunny climate. Like much of Florida, St. Augustine enjoys a high number of sunny days, averaging 2,900 hours annually. Unlike much of the contiguous United States, St. Augustines driest time of year is winter. The hot and wet season extends from May through October, while the cool and dry season extends November through April.\\r\\nIn the hot season, average daytime highs are in the upper 80s to low 90s ?F (26 to 33?C) and average night-time lows are in the low 70s?F (21?C). The Bermuda High pumps in hot and unstable tropical air from the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, which help create the daily thundershowers that are typical in summer months. Intense but very brief downpours are common in mid-summer in the city. Fall and spring are warm and sunny with highs in the 75 to 80 F (21 to 24?C) range and overnight lows in the 50s to low 60s (10 to 17?C).\\r\\nIn the dry winter season, St. Augustine has generally mild and sunny weather typical of the Florida peninsula. The coolest months are from December through February, with average daytime highs that range from 65 to 70?F (18 to 21?C) and nighttime lows in the 46-49 F (8 to 10?C) range. From November through April, St. Augustine often has long periods of rainless weather. Early spring (April) can see near drought conditions with brush fires and water restrictions in place. St. Augustine averages six frosts per year. Hurricanes occasionally impact the region; however, like most areas prone to such storms, St. Augustine rarely suffers a direct hit by a major hurricane. The last direct hit by a major hurricane to the city was Hurricane Dora in 1964. Extensive flooding occurred in the downtown area of St. Augustine when Hurricane Matthew passed east of the city in October 2016.[62]\\r\\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 12,975 people, 5,743 households, and 2,679 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,376.2 people per square mile (531/km2). There were 6,978 housing units at an average density of 549.4 per square mile (211.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 84.2% Caucasian, 11.6% African American, 0.4% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.8% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.1% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 5,743 households out of which 14.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.7% were married couples living together, 10.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 53.4% were non-families. 37.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.03 and the average family size was 2.67.\\r\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 13.1% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 23.9% from 25 to 44, 25.2% from 45 to 64, and 19% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42.6 years. For every 100 females there were 88.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.8 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $36,424, and the median income for a family was $56,055. Males had a median income of $32,409 versus $30,188 for females. The per capita income for the city was $23,485. About 7.6% of families and 21.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.8% of those under age 18 and 24.4% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nBus service is operated by the Sunshine Bus Company. Buses operate mainly between shopping centers across town, but a few go to Hastings and Jacksonville, where one can connect to JTA for additional service across Jacksonville.\\r\\nSt. Augustine has one public airport 4 miles (6.4?km) north of the downtown. It has three runways and two seaplane lanes.[65] Frontier Airlines provides seasonal service from the airport to Philadelphia and ViaAir provides seasonal service to Charlotte.[66] Various private jets and tour helicopters also operate from the airport. Northrop Grumman runs a large manufacturing plant on the grounds, where the E-2 Hawkeye is produced. Jacksonville International Airport is 40 miles to the north along I-95.\\r\\nPrimary and secondary education in St. Augustine is overseen by the St. Johns County School District. There are no county high schools located within St. Augustine's current city limits, but St. Augustine High School, Pedro Menendez High School, and St. Johns Technical High School are located in the vicinity. The Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, a state-operated boarding school for deaf and blind students, was founded in the city in 1885.[67] The Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine operates the St. Joseph Academy, Florida's oldest Catholic high school, to the west of the city.[68]\\r\\nThere are several institutions of higher education in and around St. Augustine. Flagler College is a four-year liberal arts college founded in 1968. It is located in the former Ponce de Leon Hotel in downtown St. Augustine.[69] St. Johns River State College, a state college in the Florida College System, has its St. Augustine campus just west of the city. Also in the area are the University of North Florida, Jacksonville University, and Florida State College at Jacksonville in Jacksonville.[70]\\r\\nThe institution now known as Florida Memorial University was located in St. Augustine from 1918 to 1968, when it relocated to its present campus in Miami. Originally known as Florida Baptist Academy, then Florida Normal, and then Florida Memorial College, it was a historically black institution and had a wide impact on St. Augustine while it was located there. During World War II it was chosen as the site for training the first blacks in the U. S. Signal Corps. Among its faculty members was Zora Neale Hurston; a historic marker is placed at the house where she lived while teaching at Florida Memorial[71] (and where she wrote her autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road.)[72][73]\\r\\nBell tower on northeast bastion of the Castillo de San Marcos\\r\\nNorth bastions and wall of the Castillo, looking eastward toward Anastasia Island\\r\\nSeawall south of the Castillo\\r\\nThe city gates of St. Augustine, built in 1808, part of the much older Cubo Line\\r\\nThe Government House.

Under this model, a state's government is divided into branches, each with separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the other branches. The typical division is into three branches: a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary, which is the trias politica model. It can be contrasted with the fusion of powers in some parliamentary systems where the executive and legislative branches overlap.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparation of powers, therefore, refers to the division of responsibilities into distinct branches to limit any one branch from exercising the core functions of another. The intent of separation of powers is to prevent the concentration of unchecked power and to provide for checks and balances to avoid autocracy or inefficiencies.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe separation of powers model is often imprecisely and metonymically used interchangeably with the trias politica principle. While the trias politica is a common type of this form, it is not its only type.\\r\\n\\r\\nAristotle first mentioned the idea of a \\"mixed government\\" or hybrid government in his work Politics where he drew upon many of the constitutional forms in the city-states of Ancient Greece. In the Roman Republic, the Roman Senate, Consuls and the Assemblies showed an example of a mixed government according to Polybius (Histories, Book 6, 11ÿ13).\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Calvin (1509ÿ1564) favoured a system of government that divided political power between democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). Calvin appreciated the advantages of democracy, stating: \\"It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its own government and magistrates.\\"[1] In order to reduce the danger of misuse of political power, Calvin suggested setting up several political institutions which should complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this way, Calvin and his followers resisted political absolutism and furthered the growth of democracy. Calvin aimed to protect the rights and the well-being of ordinary people.[3][need quotation to verify] In 1620, a group of English separatist Congregationalists and Anglicans (later known as the Pilgrim Fathers) founded Plymouth Colony in North America. Enjoying self-rule, they established a bipartite democratic system of government. The \\"freemen\\" elected the General Court, which functioned as legislature and judiciary and which in turn elected a governor, who together with his seven \\"assistants\\" served in the functional role of providing executive power.[4] Massachusetts Bay Colony (founded 1628), Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania had similar constitutions ÿ they all separated political powers. (Except for Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony, these English outposts added religious freedom to their democratic systems, an important step towards the development of human rights.[5][6]) Books like William Bradford's History of Plymoth Plantation (written between 1630 and 1651) were widely read in England.[citation needed] So the form of government in the colonies was well known in the mother country, including to the philosopher John Locke (1632ÿ1704). He deduced from a study of the English constitutional system the advantages of dividing political power into the legislative (which should be distributed among several bodies, for example, the House of Lords and the House of Commons), on the one hand, and the executive and federative power, responsible for the protection of the country and prerogative of the monarch, on the other hand. (The Kingdom of England had no written constitution.)[7][need quotation to verify]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"tripartite system\\" is commonly ascribed to French Enlightenment political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu, although he did not use such a term. In reality he referred to \\"distribution\\" of powers. In The Spirit of the Laws (1748), Montesquieu described the various forms of distribution of political power among a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. Montesquieu's approach was to present and defend a form of government which was not excessively centralized in all its powers to a single monarch or similar ruler, form of government known then as \\"aristocracy\\". He based this model on the Constitution of the Roman Republic and the British constitutional system. Montesquieu took the view that the Roman Republic had powers separated so that no one could usurp complete power.[8][9][10] In the British constitutional system, Montesquieu discerned a separation of powers among the monarch, Parliament, and the courts of law.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every government there are three sorts of power: the legislative; the executive in respect to things dependent on the law of nations; and the executive in regard to matters that depend on the civil law.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy virtue of the first, the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws, and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted. By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions. By the third, he punishes criminals, or determines the disputes that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary power, and the other, simply, the executive power of the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontesquieu argues that each Power should only exercise its own functions, it was quite explicit here:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, there is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere would be an end of every thing, were the same man, or the same body, whether of the nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparation of powers requires a different source of legitimization, or a different act of legitimization from the same source, for each of the separate powers. If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe executive power ought to be in the hands of a monarch, because this branch of government, having need of dispatch, is better administered by one than by many: on the other hand, whatever depends on the legislative power, is oftentimes better regulated by many than by a single person.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, if there were no monarch, and the executive power should be committed to a certain number of persons, selected from the legislative body, there would be an end of liberty, by reason the two powers would be united; as the same persons would sometimes possess, and would be always able to possess, a share in both.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontesquieu did actually specify that the independence of the judiciary has to be real, and not merely apparent.[13] The judiciary was generally seen as the most important of the three powers, independent and unchecked,[14] while also likely to claim to be the least dangerous one.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nChecks and balances is the principle that each of the Branches has the power to limit or check the other two and this creates a balance between the three separate powers of the state, this principle induces that the ambitions of one branch prevent that one of the other branches become supreme, and thus be eternally confronting each other and in that process leaving the people free from government abuses. Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place. This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches.[15] They guarantee that the powers of the state have the same weight (co-equal), that is, to be balanced, so that they can limit each other, avoiding the abuse of state power. The origin of checks and balances, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to Montesquieu in the Enlightenment (in The Spirit of the Laws, 1748), under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following example of the separation of powers and their mutual checks and balances for the experience of the United States Constitution is presented as illustrative of the general principles applied in similar forms of government as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n?But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.?\\r\\n\\r\\n?A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State.?\\r\\n\\r\\nConstitutions with a high degree of separation of powers are found worldwide. The UK system is distinguished by a particular entwining of powers.[18] A number of Latin American countries have electoral branches of government.\\r\\n\\r\\nCountries with little separation of power include New Zealand and Canada. Canada makes limited use of separation of powers in practice, although in theory it distinguishes between branches of government.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand's constitution is based on the principle of separation of powers through a series of constitutional safeguards, many of which are tacit. The Executive's ability to carry out decisions often depends on the Legislature, which is elected under the mixed member proportional system. This means the government is rarely a single party but a coalition of parties. The Judiciary is also free of government interference. If a series of judicial decisions result in an interpretation of the law which the Executive considers does not reflect the intention of the policy, the Executive can initiate changes to the legislation in question through the Legislature. The Executive cannot direct or request a judicial officer to revise or reconsider a decision; decisions are final. Should there be a dispute between the Executive and Judiciary, the Executive has no authority to direct the Judiciary, or its individual members and vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplete separation of powers systems are almost always presidential, although theoretically this need not be the case. There are a few historical exceptions, such as the Directoire system of revolutionary France. Switzerland offers an example of non-Presidential separation of powers today: It is run by a seven-member executive branch, the Federal Council. However, some might argue[weasel?words] that Switzerland does not have a strong separation of powers system, as the Federal Council is appointed by parliament (but not dependent on parliament) and although the judiciary has no power of review, the judiciary is still separate from the other branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia does not maintain a strict separation between the legislative and executive branches of governmentindeed, government ministers are required to be members of parliamentbut the federal judiciary strictly guards its independence from the other two branches. However, under influence from the American constitution, the Australian constitution does define the three branches of government separately, and this has been interpreted by the judiciary to induce an implicit separation of powers.[19] State governments have a similar level of separation of power, but this is generally on the basis of convention, rather than constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution of Austria was originally written by Hans Kelsen, the prominent constitutional scholar in Europe at that time. Kelsen was to serve as a part of the judicial court of review for Austria as part of its tripartite government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution of the Czech Republic, adopted in 1992 immediately before the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, establishes the traditional tripartite division of powers[20] and continues the tradition of its predecessor constitutions.\\r\\nThe Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920, which replaced the provisional constitution adopted by the newly independent state in 1918, was modeled after the constitutions of established democracies such as those of the United Kingdom, United States and France, and maintained this division,[21] as have subsequent changes to the constitution that followed in 1948 with the Ninth-of-May Constitution, the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia as well as the Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation of 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, the government of France[22] is divided up into three branches:\\r\\n\\r\\nHong Kong is a Special Administrative Region established in 1997 pursuant to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty made between Britain and China in 1984, registered with the United Nations. Currently, Hong Kong has three branches of government as codified in the Basic Law, its constitution, which largely preserved political structures of the British colonial era, under the doctrine of one country, two systems:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Executive, elected by a 1200-member Election Committee which historically was dominated by pro-Beijing establishment members, is both head of the region and head of government, and chairs the Executive Council which is composed of \\"unofficial\\" members and government secretaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legislature consists of 70 members, 35 of whom are elected by \\"functional\\" constituencies represented by members within various industries rather than the public at large.[24] Separation of power between executive and legislature is, therefore, questionable.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courts frequently exercise a power of judicial review of administrative actions and also decide matters of constitutionality of legislation, though this power is circumscribed under the power of the People's Republic of China's National People's Congress to make final determinations as to interpretation.[26] Hence, the separation of powers is again structurally weak.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worth noting that the branches' separation of power may not be intended within the Hong Kong Basic Law as leaders of the PRC have publicly called for the three branches to cooperate and be led by the Chief Executive.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, Deng Xiaoping was quoted to have categorically dismissed Hong Kong having a \\"Trias Politica\\" system.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia follows constitutional democracy which offers a clear separation of powers. The judiciary branch is fairly independent of the other two branches with the power to interpret the constitution. Parliament has the legislative powers. Executive powers are vested with the President who is advised by the Union Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The constitution of India vested the duty of protecting, preserving and defending the constitution with the President as common head of the executive, parliament, armed forces, etc. not only for the union government but also the various state governments in a federal structure. All three branches have \\"checks and balances\\" over each other to maintain the balance of power and not to exceed the constitutional limits.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italy the powers are separated, even though the Council of Ministers needs a vote of confidence from both chambers of Parliament, that represents a large number of members (almost 1,000).[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike every parliamentary form of government, there is no real separation between Legislature and Executive, rather a continuum between them due to the confidence link. By the way, the balance is protected by Constitution also between these two branches.[31] and, obviously, between them and the judiciary branch, which is really independent.\\r\\n\\r\\nA note on the status of separation of power, checks and balances, and balance of power in Norway today.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the original constitution of 1814 the Montesquieu concept was enshrined, and the people at the time had the same skepticism about political parties as the American founding fathers and the revolutionaries in France. Nor did people really want to get rid of the king and the Council of State (privy council). King and council was a known concept that people had lived with for a long time and was for the most part comfortable with. The 1814 constitution came about as a reaction to external events, most notable the Treaty of Kiel see 1814 in Norway. There was no revolution against the current powers that had been be the case in the US and France. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs there was no election of the executive, the king reigned supremely independent in selecting the members of the Council of State, no formal political parties formed util the 1880s. A conflict between the executive and legislature started developing in the 1870s and climaxed with the legislature impeaching the entire Council of State in 1884. (See Statsr?dssaken (Norwegian Wikipedia page))\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this came a switch to a parliamentary system of government and while the full process takes decades, it has led to a system of parliamentary sovereignty where the Montesquieu idea of separation of powers is technically dead even though the three branches remain important institutions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis does not mean that there are no checks and balances. With the introduction of a parliamentary system, political parties started to form quickly and this led to a call for electoral reform that saw the introduction of a Party-list proportional representation in 1918. The peculiarities of the Norwegian election system generate 6ÿ8 parties and make it extremely difficult for a single party to gain an absolute majority. It has only occurred for a brief period in the aftermath of World War II where the Labour Party had an absolute majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nA multi-party system parliament that must either form a minority executive or a coalition executive function as a perfectly good system of checks and balances even if it was never a stated goal for the introduction of multiparty system. The multiparty system came about in response to a public outcry of having too few parties and a general feeling of a lack of representation. For this reason you'll find very little on the topic of separation of powers or checks and balances in the works of Norwegian political sciences today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of the British constitution, which is not a codified document, is based on this fusion in the person of the Monarch, who has a formal role to play in the legislature (Parliament, which is where legal and political sovereignty lies, is the Crown-in-Parliament, and is summoned and dissolved by the Sovereign who must give his or her Royal Assent to all Bills so that they become Acts), the executive (the Sovereign appoints all ministers of His/Her Majesty's Government, who govern in the name of the Crown) and the judiciary (the Sovereign, as the fount of justice, appoints all senior judges, and all public prosecutions are brought in his or her name).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the doctrine of separation of power plays a role in the United Kingdom's constitutional doctrine, the UK constitution is often described as having \\"a weak separation of powers\\" A. V. Dicey, despite its constitution being the one to which Montesquieu originally referred. For example, in the United Kingdom, the executive forms a subset of the legislature, as didto a lesser extentthe judiciary until the establishment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, the Chief Executive, sits as a member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, either as a peer in the House of Lords or as an elected member of the House of Commons (by convention, and as a result of the supremacy of the Lower House, the Prime Minister now sits in the House of Commons) and can effectively be removed from office by a simple majority vote. Furthermore, while the courts in the United Kingdom are amongst the most independent in the world,[citation needed] the Law Lords, who were the final arbiters of judicial disputes in the UK sat simultaneously in the House of Lords, the upper house of the legislature, although this arrangement ceased in 2009 when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into existence. Furthermore, because of the existence of Parliamentary sovereignty, while the theory of separation of powers may be studied there, a system such as that of the UK is more accurately described as a \\"fusion of powers\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2005, the Lord Chancellor fused the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, as he was the ex officio Speaker of the House of Lords, a Government Minister who sat in Cabinet and was head of the Lord Chancellor's Department which administered the courts, the justice system and appointed judges, and was the head of the Judiciary in England and Wales and sat as a judge on the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, the highest domestic court in the entire United Kingdom, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the senior tribunal court for parts of the Commonwealth. The Lord Chancellor also had certain other judicial positions, including being a judge in the Court of Appeal and President of the Chancery Division. The Lord Chancellor combines other aspects of the constitution, including having certain ecclesiastical functions of the established state church, making certain church appointments, nominations and sitting as one of the thirty-three Church Commissioners. These functions remain intact and unaffected by the Constitutional Reform Act. In 2005, the Constitutional Reform Act separated the powers with Legislative functions going to an elected Lord Speaker and the Judicial functions going to the Lord Chief Justice. The Lord Chancellor's Department was replaced with a Ministry of Justice and the Lord Chancellor currently serves in the position of Secretary of State for Justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, and can only rule on secondary legislation that it is invalid with regard to the primary legislation if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, Parliament can enact any primary legislation it chooses. However, the concept immediately becomes problematic when the question is asked; \\"If parliament can do anything, can it bind its successors?\\". It is generally held that parliament can do no such thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually, while statute takes precedence over precedent-derived common law and the judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, there are certain cases where the supreme judicature has effected an injunction against the application of an act or reliance on its authority by the civil service. The seminal example of this is the Factortame case, where the House of Lords granted such an injunction preventing the operation of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 until litigation in the European Court of Justice had been resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House of Lords ruling in Factortame (No. 1), approving the European Court of Justice formulation that \\"a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule\\", has created an implicit tiering of legislative reviewability; the only way for parliament to prevent the supreme judicature from injunctively striking out a law on the basis of incompatibility with Community law is to pass an act specifically removing that power from the court, or by repealing the European Communities Act 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British legal systems are based on common law traditions, which require:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparation of powers was first established in the United States Constitution, the founding fathers included features of many new concepts, including hard-learned historical lessons about the checks and balances of power. Similar concepts were also prominent in the state governments of the United States. As colonies of Great Britain, the founding fathers considered that the American states had suffered an abuse of the broad power of parliamentarism and monarchy. As a remedy, the US Constitution limits the powers of the federal government through various means, in particular, the three branches of the federal government are divided by exercising different functions, and the executive and legislative powers are separated in origin by separate elections and the judiciary is kept independent, each branch controls the actions of others and balances its powers in some way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States Constitution, Article 1 Section I gives Congress only those \\"legislative powers herein granted\\" and proceeds to list those permissible actions in Article I Section 8, while Section 9 lists actions that are prohibited for Congress. The vesting clause in Article II places no limits on the Executive branch, simply stating that, \\"The Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\\"[33] The Supreme Court holds \\"The judicial Power\\" according to Article III, and it established the implication of Judicial review in Marbury v. Madison under the Marshall court.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presidential system adopted by the Constitution of the United States obeys the balance of powers sought, and not found, by the constitutional monarchy. The people appoint their representatives to meet periodically in a legislative body, and, since they do not have a king, the people themselves elect a preeminent citizen to perform, also periodically, the executive functions of the State. The direct election of the head of state or of the executive power is an inevitable consequence of the political freedom of the people, understood as the capacity to appoint and depose their leaders. Only this separate election of the person who has to fulfill the functions that the Constitution attributes to the president of the government, so different by its nature, and by its function, from the election of representatives of the electors, allows the executive power to be controlled by the legislative and submitted to the demands of political responsibility.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nJudicial independence is maintained by appointments for life that makes disappear very soon any sense of dependence on the Executive, with voluntary retirement and a high threshold of dismissal by the Legislature, in addition to a salary that can not be diminished during their service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal government refers to the branches as \\"branches of government\\", while some systems use \\"government\\" to describe the executive. The Executive branch has attempted[36] to claim power arguing for separation of powers to include being the Commander in Chief of a standing army since the American Civil War, executive orders, emergency powers and security classifications since World War II, national security, signing statements, and the scope of the unitary executive.\\r\\n\\r\\n?In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others. Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through channels having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them.?\\r\\n\\r\\n?It is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal.?\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Sun Yat-sen's idea of \\"separation of the five powers\\", the government of the Republic of China has five branches:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president and vice president as well as the defunct National Assembly are constitutionally not part of the above five branches. Before being abolished in 2005, the National Assembly was a standing constituent assembly and electoral college for the president and vice president. Its constitutional amending powers were passed to the legislative yuan and its electoral powers were passed to the electorate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between the executive and legislative branches are poorly defined. An example of the problems this causes is the near complete political paralysis that results when the president, who has neither the power to veto nor the ability to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, cannot negotiate with the legislature when his party is in the minority.[37] The examination and control yuans are marginal branches; their leaders as well as the leaders of the executive and judicial yuans are appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislative yuan. The legislature is the only branch that chooses its own leadership. The vice president has practically no responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgium is currently a federated state that has imposed the trias politica on different governmental levels. The constitution of 1831, considered one of the most liberal of its time for limiting the powers of its monarch and imposing a rigorous system of separation of powers, is based on three principles (represented in the Schematic overview of Belgian institutions):\\r\\n\\r\\nTrias Politica (horizontal separation of powers):\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsidiarity (vertical separation of powers):\\r\\n\\r\\nSecularism (separation of state and religion):\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the 43-day civil war in 1948 (after former President and incumbent candidate Rafael lgel Calder܇n Guardia tried to take power through fraud, by not recognising the results of the presidential election that he had lost), the question of which transformational model the Costa Rican State would follow was the main issue that confronted the victors. A Constituent Assembly was elected by popular vote to draw up a new constitution, enacted in 1949, and remains in force. This document was an edit of the constitution of 1871, as the constituent assembly rejected more radical corporatist ideas proposed by the ruling Junta Fundadora de la Segunda Rep~blica (which, although having come to power by military force, abolished the armed forces). Nonetheless, the new constitution increased centralization of power at the expense of municipalities and eliminated provincial government altogether, at the time it increased the powers of congress and the judiciary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt established the three supreme powers as the legislature, executive, and judicial branches, but also created two other autonomous state organs that have equivalent power, but not equivalent rank. The first is the Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica (electoral branch) which controls elections and makes unique, unappealable decisions on their outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second is the office of the Comptroller General (audit branch), an autonomous and independent organ nominally subordinate to the unicameral legislative assembly. All budgets of ministries and municipalities must pass through this agency, including the execution of budget items such as contracting for routine operations. The Comptroller also provides financial vigilance over government offices and office holders, and routinely brings actions to remove mayors for malfeasance, firmly establishing this organization as the fifth branch of the Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Union is a supranational polity, and is neither a country nor a federation; but as the EU wields political power it complies with the principle of separation of powers. There are seven institutions of the European Union. In intergovernmental matters, most power is concentrated in the Council of the European Uniongiving it the characteristics of a normal international organization. Here, all power at the EU level is in one branch. In the latter there are four main actors. The European Commission acts as an independent executive which is appointed by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament; but the Commission also has a legislative role as the sole initiator of EU legislation.[38][39]\\r\\n[40] An early maxim was: \\"The Commission proposes and the Council disposes\\"; and although the EU's lawmaking procedure is now much more complicated, this simple maxim still holds some truth. As well as both executive and legislative functions, the Commission arguably exercises a third, quasi-judicial, function under Articles 101 & 102 TFEU (competition law ); although the ECJ remains the final arbiter. The European Parliament is one half of the legislative branch and is directly elected. The Council itself acts both as the second half of the legislative branch and also holds some executive functions (some of which are exercised by the related European Council in practice). The European Court of Justice acts as the independent judicial branch, interpreting EU law and treaties. The remaining institution, the European Court of Auditors, is an independent audit authority (due to the sensitive nature of fraud in the EU).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three branches in German government are further divided into six main bodies enshrined in the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany:\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the constitutional court the judicial branch at the federal level is made up of five supreme courtsone for civil and criminal cases (Bundesgerichtshof), and one each for administrative, tax, labour, and social security issues. There are also state (L?nder / Bundesl?nder) based courts beneath them, and a rarely used senate of the supreme courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four independent branches of power in Hungary (the parliament, the government, the court system, and the office of the public accuser) are divided into six bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe independent pillar status of the Hungarian public accuser's office is a unique construction, loosely modeled on the system Portugal introduced after the 1974 victory of the Carnation Revolution. The public accuser (attorney general) body has become the fourth column of Hungarian democracy only in recent times: after communism fell in 1989, the office was made independent by a new clausule XI. of the Constitution. The change was meant to prevent abuse of state power, especially with regards to the use of false accusations against opposition politicians, who may be excluded from elections if locked in protracted or excessively severe court cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent the Hungarian accuser's office from neglecting its duties, natural human private persons can submit investigation requests, called \\"p܇tmagnvd\\" directly to the courts, if the accusers' office refuses to do its job. Courts will decide if the allegations have merit and order police to act in lieu of the accuser's office if warranted. In its decision No. 42/2005 the Hungarian constitutional court declared that the government does not enjoy such privilege and the state is powerless to further pursue cases if the public accuser refuses to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Empire of Brazil had, in addition to the three traditional powers, the moderating power, which was exercised solely by the Emperor,[41] and which function was resolving conflicts between the other powers.","input":"Who developed the system of checks and balances?"},{"output":"over 390","context":"Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd is the exclusive Australian master fast food franchise of Burger King Corporation. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Competitive Foods Australia, a privately held company owned by Jack Cowin. Hungry Jack's owns and operates or sub-licences all of the Burger King/Hungry Jack's restaurants in Australia. As the master franchise for the country, the company is responsible for licensing new operators, opening its own stores and performing standards oversight of franchised locations in that country. With over 390 locations across Australia, Hungry Jack's is the second largest franchise of Burger King in the world (second to Carrols Corporation).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Burger King moved to expand its operations into Australia, it found that its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop in Adelaide.[3] As a result, Burger King provided the Australian franchisee, Jack Cowin, with a list of possible alternative names derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury that could be used to name the Australian restaurants. Cowin selected the \\"Hungry Jack\\" brand name, one of Pillsbury's U.S. pancake mixture products, and slightly changed the name to a possessive form by adding an apostrophe and \\"s\\" to form the new name \\"Hungry Jack's\\".[4] The first Australian franchise of Burger King Corporation was established in Innaloo, Perth on 18 April 1971, under the auspices of Cowin's new company Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd.[5] By the end of its first decade of operation, Hungry Jack's had expanded to 26 stores in three states. In October 1981, the company opened its first New South Wales store in Sydney's CBD on the corner of Liverpool and George Street. In 1986, the chain entered Victoria by purchasing 11 stores from the ailing Wendy's Hamburger chain, later converting them to Hungry Jack's.[6]\\r\\nIn 1991, Hungry Jack's Pty Limited renewed its franchise agreement with Burger King Corporation which allowed the Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee; however, one of the conditions of the agreement was that Hungry Jack's had to open a certain number of stores every year for the term of the contract. In 1996, shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed, Burger King Corporation made a claim that Hungry Jack's had violated the conditions of the renewed franchise agreement by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined in the contract and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and throughout the Australian regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania.[7][8][9][10] In addition, Burger King sought to limit HJ's ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.[11]\\r\\nAs a result of Burger King's actions,[citation needed] Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his company Competitive Foods Australia, began legal proceedings in 2001 against the Burger King Corporation, claiming Burger King Corporation had violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract.[citation needed] The Supreme Court of New South Wales agreed with Cowin and determined that Burger King had violated the terms of the contract and awarded Hungry Jack's A$46.9?million (US$41.6?million in 2001).[12] In its decision, the Court said that Burger King sought to engineer a default of the franchise agreement so that the company could limit the number of new Hungry Jacks branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, which was a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.[11][13] The case introduced the American legal concept of good faith negotiations into the Australian legal system, which until the time of the verdict had been rarely used in the Australian court systems.[14][15]\\r\\nAfter Burger King Corporation lost the case, it decided to terminate its operations in the country and in July 2002 the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group, Trans-Pacific Foods (TPF).[16][17] The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises in the region as the Burger King brand's master franchisee.[18] Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make Hungry Jack's Pty the sole master franchisee of both brands.[citation needed] An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to ensure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products.[19] Trans-Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as \\"Hungry Jack's,\\" joining the other 210 outlets at the time.[4][8]\\r\\nMany new Hungry Jack's restaurants have a 1950s theme. Music from this era may be played within the restaurant (occasionally through a '50s-style jukebox) with associated contemporary pictures and memorabilia utilized as part of the decor. In the larger sit-down style restaurants, the seats and tables are laid out in a 1950s diner style.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 2009ÿ2010 financial year, Competitive Foods Australia reported an after-tax profit of $32.1 million on sales of $1.043 billion.[20]\\r\\nIn late 2011, it was announced that Hungry Jack's will undergo a complete overhaul of its menus, restaurants, staff uniforms and advertising. The 'Burgers are Better' slogan has been replaced with 'Hungry Jack's makes it better'. The current '70s style restaurants will be renovated, new Asian styled meals and Organic beef options have been added to the menu and a new website and mobile application have been created. The full redesign is expected to be completed by the end of the 2013 financial year.[21]\\r\\nHungry Jack's products include burgers (meat and vegetarian options), chicken, chips, onion rings, salads, drinks (hot and cold beverages) kid meals and desserts, as well as a full breakfast menu.

All other Burger King products go by more generic naming schemes, such as \\"Hamburger\\", \\"Veggie Burger\\", or \\"Grilled Chicken Burger\\".[22][23]\\r\\nHungry Jack's breakfast menu, introduced in late 2005 in three states (Queensland, Western Australia, and Northern Territory) and the other states the following year in 2006, bears little resemblance to Burger King's US breakfast menu. The main breakfast sandwich is served on either an English muffin or a wrap (breakfast burrito) instead of a croissant; the hash browns are served as patties as opposed to Tater Tots and the restaurant features pancakes.[22][23] Hungry Jack's now includes new healthier option salad line and deli style baguettes.\\r\\nHungry Jack's in Australia has trademarked the new slogan, 'Oh Yeah', which was featured in television commercials that ran late 2005/early 2006. While Burger King has updated its logo to the \\"blue crescent\\" design in all other markets from 1999, the Hungry Jack's logo is still based on the previous 1996 revised Burger King bun-halves logo, employing the simpler bun-and-filling motif.[25]\\r\\nHungry Jack's Kid's Club mascots are unique to the Australian franchisee, as opposed to other international locations that use one of the two existing BK kid's mascots, the Burger King Kids' Club or the Honbatz. HJ does have a Kid's Club program similar to the US offering, offering themed birthday parties at its restaurants along with its Kid's Club Meals.

It has hosted some of the most notable events in music, dance, theatre, opera and literature and has held important exhibitions of painting, sculpture and photography. Consequently, the Palacio de Bellas Artes has been called the \\"Cathedral of Art in Mexico\\". The building is located on the western side of the historic center of Mexico City next to the Alameda Central park.\\r\\nThe first National Theater of Mexico was built in the late 19th century, but it was soon decided to tear this down in favor of a more opulent building in time for Centennial of the Mexican War of Independence in 1910. The initial design and construction was undertaken by Italian architect Adamo Boari in 1904, but complications arising from the soft subsoil and the political problem both before and during the Mexican Revolution, hindered then stopped construction completely by 1913. Construction began again in 1932 under Mexican architect Federico Mariscal and was completed in 1934. The exterior of the building is primarily Neoclassical and Art Nouveau and the interior is primarily Art Deco. The building is best known for its murals by Diego Rivera, Siqueiros and others, as well as the many exhibitions and theatrical performances its hosts, including the Ballet Folkl܇rico de Mxico.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known structure on the site was the Convent of Santa Isabel, whose church was built in 1680. However, significant Aztec finds, such as a sacrificial altar in the shape of a plumed serpent have been found here. The convent area suffered frequent flooding during the early colonial period and development here grew slowly. In spite of this, the convent remained until it was forcibly closed in the 1860s by the Reform Laws. It was replaced by a textile mill and lower-class housing.[1]\\r\\nA section of this housing, on Santa Isabel Alley, was torn down and replaced by the National Theater in the latter 19th century. During the late 19th century and very early 20th, this theatre was the site of most of Mexico City's high culture, presenting events such as theatre, operettas, Viennese dance and more. It was then decided to replace this building with a more opulent one for the upcoming Centennial of Mexican Independence celebrations in 1910. The old theatre was demolished in 1901, and the new theatre would be called the Gran Teatro de ܇pera. The work was awarded to Italian architect Adamo Boari, who favored neoclassical and art nouveau styles and who is responsible for the Palacio del Correo which is across the street.[1][2] Adamo Boari promised in October 1904 to build a grand metallic structure, which at that time only existed in the United States, but not to this size. The first stone of the building was placed by Porfirio Daz in 1904.[3] Despite the 1910 deadline, by 1913, the building was hardly begun with only a basic shell. One reason for this is that the project became more complicated than anticipated as the heavy building sank into the soft spongy subsoil. The other reason was the political and economic instability that would lead to the Mexican Revolution. Full hostilities suspended construction of the palace completely and Adamo Boari returned to Italy.[1][2]\\r\\nThe project would sit unfinished for about twenty years. In 1932, construction resumed under Mexican architect Federico Mariscal. Mariscal completed the interior but updated it from Boari's plans to the more modern Art Deco style. The building was completely finished in 1934,[1][2] and was inaugurated on 29 September of that year.[3] The inaugural work presented in the theatre was \\"La Verdad Sospechosa\\" by Juan Ruiz de Alarc܇n in 1934.[4] In 1946, the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Institute of the Fine Arts) was created as a government agency to promote the arts and was initially housed at the Museo Nacional de Artes Plsticas, the Museo del Libro and other places. It is now at the Palacio.[1]\\r\\nIn this theatre, Maria Callas debuted in the opera Norma in 1950.[4]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Palace was the scene of the funeral of Mara Flix.[4]\\r\\nSince its initial construction, very little has been updated or modified. However, intensive renovation efforts were begun in 2009 for the upcoming 2010 celebrations.[3] Much of the equipment and machinery is original from the early 20th century. Much of the technological equipment is being updated, especially in the theatre which needs computerized lights, sound systems and other improvements. Other work will improve the acoustics.[5] Upgrades to the theatre will allow for multimedia shows which were not available before.[6] The main hall has had no renovation or upgrade work since it opened in 1934.[5] Renovations here will lessen the number of people the hall can accommodate but should make the area more comfortable.[6]\\r\\nThe palace has a mixture of a number of architectural styles; however, it is principally Art Nouveau and Art Deco.[1] Art Nouveau dominates the exterior, which was done by Adamo Boari, and the inside is dominated by Art Deco, which was completed by Federico Mariscal. Since construction began in 1904, the theater (which opened in 1934) has sunk some four meters into the soft soil of Mexico City.[7] The main facade, which faces Avenida Jurez, is made of white Italian Carrara marble. In the interior of the portal are sculptures by Italian Leonardo Bistolfi. It consists of \\"Harmony\\", surrounded by \\"Pain\\", \\"Rage\\", \\"Happiness\\", \\"Peace\\" and \\"Love\\". Another portion of the facade contains cherubs and sculptures representing music and inspiration.[1] On the plaza front of the building, designed by Boari, there are four Pegasus sculptures which were made by Catalan Agust Querol Subirats. These had been in the Zocalo before being brought here.[1] The roof covering the center of the building is made of crystal designed by Hungarian Gza Mar܇ti and depicts the muses with Apollo.[3] One aspect of the Palace which has since disappeared is the \\"Pergola\\", which was located in the Alameda. It was constructed to house pictorial exhibitions for the 1910 celebrations, but it was demolished in 1973.[1]\\r\\nThe interior is also surfaced in Carrara marble.[3] It divides into three sections: the main hall with adjoining smaller exhibition halls, the theatre and the offices of the Insituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. The main hall is covered by the Marotti glass and iron roof. It and the balconies of all three upper floors can be seen from the ground floor below.[1] In areas of the main hall, pre-Hispanic motifs done in Art Deco style, such as serpents heads on window arches and Maya Chaac masks on the vertical light panels distinguish this interior from its contemporaries.[2] The smaller exhibition halls are located on the first and second floors. The first floor is decorated with crystal lamps, created by Edgar Brandt and hold murals by Rufino Tamayo. The Adamo Boari and Manuel M. Ponce halls hold music and literature events. And the National and International halls are for exhibitions. The second floor has smaller exhibition halls as well as murals by Jos Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Jorge Gonzlez Camarena, Roberto Montenegro and Manuel Rodrguez Lozano. The third floor is occupied by the Museum of Architecture. The ironwork was designed in Italy by Alessandro Mazzucotelli and in Mexico by Luis Romero Soto.[1]\\r\\nAt the entrance of the theatre, there are mascarons in bronze with depictions of Tlaloc, and Chaac, the Aztec and Maya deities of water, which along with the rest were designed by Gianette Fiorenzo. On the arch over the stage there are representations of various mythological personas such as the Muses with Apollo. This was constructed in Hungary in the workshops of Gza Mar܇ti.[1] However, the most impacting aspect is the stage \\"curtain\\" which is a stained glass foldable panel created out of nearly a million pieces of iridescent colored glass by Tiffany's in New York.[7] This stage curtain is the only one of its type in any opera house in the world and weighs 24 tons.[3] The design of the curtain has the volcanos Popocatpetl and Iztacchuatl in the center. Around them is a Mexican landscape surrounded by images of sculptures from Yautepec and Oaxaca. This design was inspired by work done by artist Gerardo Murillo (Dr. Atl).[1][7] The theatre has a capacity of 1,000.[8]\\r\\nThe Palace has been the scene of some of the most notable events in music, dance, theatre, opera and literature and has hosted important exhibitions of painting, sculpture and photography. It has hosted some of the biggest names from both Mexico and abroad. It has hosted poetry events as well as those related to popular culture.[9] Artists and companies are from all parts of Mexico and abroad.[10] It has been called the \\"Cathedral of Art in Mexico\\"[9] and is considered to be the most important theatre and the most important cultural center in Mexico. It was declared an artistic monument in 1987 by UNESCO. The building is administered by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes of the federal government.[3] The palace receive on average 10,000 visitors each week.[8]\\r\\nTwo of the best-known groups which regularly perform here are the Ballet Folkl܇rico de Mxico Compania Nacional de Opera de Bellas Artes and the National Symphonic Orchestra.[11] The first performs in the theatre twice a week and is a spectacle of pre and post Hispanic dance of Mexico. A typical program includes Aztec ritual dances, agricultural dances from Jalisco, a fiesta in Veracruz, a wedding celebration  all accompanies by mariachis, marimba players and singers.[2][3] Regular annual events include the Premio Quorum for Mexican designers in graphic and industrial materials[12] and the Premios Ariel for Mexican films.[13]\\r\\nIndividual events that have been held here are numerous. Some of these include several exhibitions of Frida Kahlo's work,[14][15] and a number of appearances by Luciano Pavarotti.[16] In 1987, Bellas Artes hosted a legendary performance of Jesusa Rodrguez's Donna Giovanni, an adaptation of Mozart's opera with a female cast.[17] Other appearances have been made by Mexican baritone Jorge Lagunes (2002)[18] and Catalan guitarist Joan Manuel Serrat (2003).[19] Events that have been held here include \\"ABCDF Palabras de Ciudad\\" (2002) showing life in popular housing in photographs and video, \\"Bordados del Mexico Antiguo\\" (Embroidery of Old Mexico) showing processes, history and design,[12] Rem Koolhaas Premio Pritzker 2000\\" conference[20] and \\"Exchanging Views: Visions of Latin America\\" which was an exhibit from the collection of Patricia Phelps de Cisneros comprising 148 works by 72 artists from across Latin America in 2006.[21]\\r\\nOccasionally, the plaza in front of the Palace is the scene of protests such as those against the Iraq War in 2003[22] and against bullfighting in 2010.[23]\\r\\nThe floors between the ground floor and the uppermost floor are dominated by a number of murals painted by most of the famous names of Mexican muralism.[7]\\r\\nOn the 2nd floor are two early-1950s works by Rufino Tamayo: Mxico de Hoy (Mexico Today) and Nacimiento de la Nacionalidad (Birth of Nationality), a symbolic depiction of the creation of the mestizo (person of mixed indigenous and Spanish ancestry) identity.[2]\\r\\nAt the west end of the 3rd floor is El hombre controlador del universo (Man, controller of the universe- known as Man at the Crossroads), originally commissioned for New York's Rockefeller Center in 1933. The mural depicts a variety of technological and societal themes (such as the discoveries made possible by microscopes and telescopes) and was controversial for its inclusion of Lenin and a Soviet May Day parade. The Rockefellers were not happy with the painting and the incomplete work was eventually destroyed and painted over. Rivera recreated it here in 1934.[2][7] On the north side of the third floor are David Alfaro Siqueiros' three-part La Nueva Democraca (New Democracy) and Rivera's four-part Carnaval de la Vida Mexicana (Carnival of Mexican Life); to the east is Jos Clemente Orozco's La Katharsis (Catharsis), depicting the conflict between humankind's 'social' and 'natural' aspects.[2]\\r\\nThe Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes (Museum of the Palacio de Bellas Artes) is the organization that takes care of the permanent murals and other artwork in the building as well as arrange temporary exhibits. These exhibits cover a wide range of media and feature Mexican and international artists, focusing on classic and contemporary artists.[24]\\r\\nThe Museo Nacional de Arquitectura (Museum of Architecture) occupies the top floor of the building, covered by the glass and iron roof. It contains exhibitions from renowned Mexican architects including models, plans and photographs of major works. This museum also arranges temporary exhibitions of its collections in other facilities. The purpose is to expose the Mexican public to the country's rich architectural heritage. Some of the major architects featured at the museum include Jaime Ortiz Monasterio, Carlos Mijares Bracho, Adamo Boari and Luis Barragn.[25] The museum is divided into four sections called \\"Arquitectura-contrastes: Jaime Ortiz Monasterio y Carlos Mijares Bracho\\", \\"Corpus Urbanstico de la Ciudad de Mxico\\", \\"Teatro Nacional de Mxico (Plano original)\\" and \\"Teatro Nacional de Mxico.\\"[26] There are also temporary exhibits on contemporary architecture.[2]","input":"What is the cathedral of art in mexico?"},{"output":"16th century","context":"European exploration and settlement of Oceania began in the 16th century, starting with Portuguese settling the Moluccas and Spanish (Castilian) landings and shipwrecks in the Marianas Islands, east of the Philippines, followed by the Portuguese landing and settling temporarily (due to the monsoons) in the Tanimbar or the Aru Islands and in some of the Caroline Islands and Papua New Guinea, and several Spanish landings in the Caroline Islands and New Guinea.[citation needed] Subsequent rivalry between European colonial powers, trade opportunities and Christian missions drove further European exploration and eventual settlement. After the 17th century Dutch landings in New Zealand and Australia, but not settling these lands, the British became the dominant colonial power in the region, establishing settler colonies in what would become Australia and New Zealand, both of which now have majority European-descended populations. New Caledonia (Caldoche),[1] Hawaii,[2] French Polynesia,[3] Norfolk Island, Easter Island and Guam[4] also have significant European populations. Europeans remain a primary ethnic group in much of Oceania, both numerically and economically.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean settlement in Australia began in 1788 when the British established the Crown Colony of New South Wales with the first settlement at Port Jackson. New Zealand was part of New South Wales until 1840 when it became a separate colony and experienced a marked increase in European settlement.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile the largest European ethnic group to originally settle in both Australia and New Zealand were the English, the settler population in Australia from early times contained a large Irish Catholic component, in contrast to New Zealand which was more Scottish in composition.\\r\\nFor generations, the vast majority of both colonial-era settlers and post-independence immigrants to Australia and New Zealand came almost exclusively from the British Isles.

The country has the most religiously diverse society of all states within the Middle East, comprising 18 recognized religious sects.[1] The main two religions are Islam (Shia and Sunni) with 54% of followers and Christianity (the Maronite Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Protestant Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church) with 40.4% of followers. There is also the Druze minority religion, which under the Lebanese political division (Parliament of Lebanon Seat Allocation) the Druze community is designated as one of the five Lebanese Muslim communities (Sunni, Shia, Druze, Alawi, and Ismaili).[2][2]\\r\\nLebanon thus differs from other Middle Eastern countries where the Muslims are overwhelming majority and more resembles Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania, both in Southeastern Europe, in having a diverse mix of Muslims and Christians that each make up approximately half the country's population.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo official census has been taken since 1932, reflecting the political sensitivity in Lebanon over confessional (i.e. religious) balance.[3][4] As a result, the religious affiliation of the Lebanese population is very difficult to establish with certainty and various sources are used to get the possible estimate of the population by religious affiliation.\\r\\nThe following are different sources that do not pretend to be fully representative of the religious affiliation of the people of Lebanon.\\r\\nThe most recent study conducted by Statistics Lebanon, a Beirut-based research firm, found that approximately Lebanon's population is estimated to be 54% Muslim (27% Shia; 27% Sunni), 5.6% Druze, who do not consider themselves to be Muslims, 40.4% Christian (21% Maronite, 8% Greek Orthodox, 5% Melkite, 1% Protestant and 5.4% other Christian denominations non-native to Lebanon like Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, Syriac Catholic, Syriac Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Chaldean, Assyrian, Copt).[5]\\r\\nThe CIA World Factbook estimates the following: Muslim 54% (27% Shia, 27% Sunni), Christian 40.5% (includes 21% Maronite Catholic, 8% Greek Orthodox, 5% Melkite, 1% Protestant, 5.5% other Christian), Druze 5.6%, very small numbers of Jews, Baha'is, Buddhists, Hindus, and Mormons.[6]\\r\\nThe International Foundation for Electoral Systems provides source for the registered voters in Lebanon for 2011[7] (it has to be noted that voter registration does not include people under 18 and unregistered voters) that puts the numbers as following: Sunni Islam 27.65?%, Shia Islam 27.34%, Maronite Catholic 21.05%, Greek Orthodox 7.34%, Druze 5.74%, Melkite Catholic 4.76%, Armenian Apostolic 2.64%, other Christian Minorities 1.28%, Alawite Shia Islam 0.88%, Armenian Catholic 0.62%, Evangelical Protestant 0.53%, and other 0.18% of the population.\\r\\nLebanon also has a Jewish population, estimated at less than 100.\\r\\nLegally registered Muslims form around 54% of the population (Shias, Sunnis, Alawites).

She was the last woman to be hanged in the United Kingdom, after being convicted of the murder of her lover, David Blakely.\\r\\nDuring her childhood, her family moved from Rhyl, to Basingstoke and, in 1941, to Hampstead in London. Then, in her teens, Ellis entered the world of London nightclub hostessing, which led to a chaotic life that included various relationships with men. One of these was with David Blakely, a racing driver engaged to another woman.\\r\\nOn Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, Ellis shot Blakely dead outside the Magdala public house in Hampstead and was immediately arrested by an off-duty policeman. At her trial in June 1955, she was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. On 13 July, she was hanged at HM Prison Holloway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEllis was born in Rhyl in North Wales, the fifth of six children. During her childhood her family moved to Basingstoke in Hampshire. Her mother, Elisaberta (Bertha) Goethals, was a Belgian refugee; her father, Arthur Hornby, was a cellist from Manchester. The Register of Marriages gives Arthur Hornby as marrying Eliza B. Goethals, at Chorlton, in 1920. Arthur changed his surname to Neilson after the birth of Ruth's older sister Muriel in 1925.\\r\\nEllis attended Fairfields Senior Girls' School in Basingstoke,[1] leaving when she was 14 to work as a waitress. Shortly afterwards, in 1941, the Neilsons moved to London. In 1944, 17-year-old Ruth became pregnant by a married Canadian soldier named Clare and gave birth to a son, whom she named Clare Andrea Neilson,[1] known as \\"Andy\\".[2] The father sent money for about a year, then stopped. The child eventually went to live with Ellis's mother.[3]\\r\\nEllis became a nightclub hostess through nude modelling work, which paid significantly more than the various factory and clerical jobs she had held since leaving school. Morris Conley, the manager of the Court Club in Duke Street, where she worked, blackmailed his hostess employees into sleeping with him. Early in 1950 she became pregnant by one of her regular customers, having taken up prostitution.[3] She had this pregnancy terminated (illegally) in the third month and returned to work as soon as she could.\\r\\nOn 8 November 1950, she married 41-year-old George Johnston Ellis, a divorced dentist with two sons, at the register office in Tonbridge, Kent.[4] He had been a customer at the Court Club. He was a violent alcoholic, jealous and possessive, and the marriage deteriorated rapidly because he was convinced she was having an affair. Ruth left him several times but always returned.\\r\\nIn 1951, while four months pregnant, Ruth appeared, uncredited, as a beauty queen in the Rank film Lady Godiva Rides Again.[5] She subsequently gave birth to a daughter Georgina, but George refused to acknowledge paternity and they separated shortly afterwards. Ruth and her son moved in with her parents and she went back to prostitution to make ends meet.[3]\\r\\nIn 1953, Ruth Ellis decided to become the manager of the Little Club, a nightclub in Knightsbridge. At this time, she was lavished with expensive gifts by admirers, and had a number of celebrity friends.[3] She met David Blakely, three years her junior, through racing driver Mike Hawthorn. Blakely was a well-mannered former public school boy, but also a hard-drinking racer. Within weeks he moved into her flat above the club, despite being engaged to another woman, Mary Dawson. Ellis became pregnant for the fourth time but aborted the child, feeling she could not reciprocate the level of commitment shown by Blakely towards their relationship.[6]\\r\\nShe then began seeing Desmond Cussen. Born in 1922 in Surrey, he had been an RAF pilot, flying Lancaster bombers during the Second World War, leaving the RAF in 1946, when he took up accountancy. He was appointed a director of the family business Cussen & Co., a wholesale and retail tobacconists with outlets in London and South Wales. When Ruth was sacked as manager of the Little Club, she moved in with Cussen at 20 Goodward Court, Devonshire Street, north of Oxford Street, becoming his mistress.\\r\\nThe relationship with Blakely continued, however, and became increasingly violent and embittered as Ellis and Blakely continued to see other people.[6] Blakely offered to marry Ellis, to which she consented, but she lost another child in January 1955, after a miscarriage induced by a punch to the stomach in an argument with Blakely.[6]\\r\\nOn Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955,[8] Ellis took a taxi from Cussen's home to a second floor flat at 29 Tanza Road, Hampstead, the home of Anthony and Carole Findlater, where she suspected Blakely might be. As she arrived, Blakely's car drove off, so she paid off the taxi and walked the quarter mile to the Magdala,[9] a four-storey public house in South Hill Park, Hampstead, where she found Blakely's car parked outside.\\r\\nAt around 9:30?pm David Blakely and his friend Clive Gunnell emerged. Blakely passed Ellis waiting on the pavement when she stepped out of Henshaws Doorway, a newsagent next to the Magdala. He ignored her when she said \\"Hello, David,\\" then shouted \\"David!\\"\\r\\nAs Blakely searched for the keys to his car,[10] Ellis took a .38 calibre Smith & Wesson Victory model revolver from her handbag and fired five shots at Blakely. The first shot missed and he started to run, pursued by Ellis round the car, where she fired a second, which caused him to collapse onto the pavement. She then stood over him and fired three more bullets into him. One bullet was fired less than half an inch from Blakely's back and left powder burns on his skin.\\r\\nEllis was seen to stand mesmerised over the body and witnesses reported hearing several distinct clicks as she tried to fire the revolver's sixth and final shot, before finally firing into the ground. This bullet ricocheted off the road and injured Gladys Kensington Yule in the base of her thumb as she walked to the Magdala.\\r\\nEllis, in a state of shock, asked Gunnell, \\"Will you call the police, Clive?\\" She was arrested immediately by an off-duty policeman, Alan Thompson, who took the gun from her, put it in his coat pocket, and heard her say, \\"I am guilty, I'm a little confused.\\" She was taken to Hampstead police station where she appeared to be calm and not obviously under the influence of drink or drugs. She made a detailed confession to the police and was charged with murder. Blakely's body was taken to hospital with multiple bullet wounds to the intestines, liver, lung, aorta and trachea.\\r\\nThe police interrogated Ellis and took a statement at Hampstead police station. She made her first appearance at the magistrates' court on 11 April 1955 and was ordered to be held on remand.\\r\\nShe was twice examined by principal Medical Officer, M. R. Penry Williams, who failed to find evidence of mental illness and she undertook an electroencephalography examination on 3 May that failed to find any abnormality. While on remand in Holloway, she was examined by psychiatrist Dr D. Whittaker for the defence, and by Dr A. Dalzell on behalf of the Home Office. Neither found evidence of insanity.\\r\\nOn 20 June 1955, Ellis appeared in the Number One Court at the Old Bailey, London, before Mr Justice Havers. She was dressed in a black suit and white silk blouse with freshly bleached and coiffured blonde hair. Her lawyers expressed concern about her appearance (and dyed blonde hair), but she did not alter it to appear less striking.\\r\\nIt's obvious when I shot him I intended to kill him.[11]\\r\\nThis was her answer to the only question put to her by Christmas Humphreys, counsel for the Prosecution, who asked, \\"When you fired the revolver at close range into the body of David Blakely, what did you intend to do?\\"[11] The defending counsel, Aubrey Melford Stevenson, supported by Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, would have advised Ellis of this possible question before the trial began, because it is standard legal practice to do so. Her reply to Humphreys's question in open court guaranteed a guilty verdict and therefore the mandatory death sentence which followed. The jury took 20 minutes to convict her.[11] She received the sentence, and was taken to the condemned cell at Holloway.\\r\\nIn a 2010 television interview Mr Justice Havers's grandson, actor Nigel Havers, said his grandfather had written to the Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George recommending a reprieve as he regarded it as a crime passionnel, but received a curt refusal, which was still held by the family.\\r\\nEllis told her mother that she did not want a petition to reprieve her from the death sentence, and took no part in the campaign. However her relatives urged her solicitor John Bickford to petition to the Home Secretary, and he wrote a seven-page letter setting out the grounds. Gwilym Lloyd George took all the papers to the house of his sister Megan Lloyd George over the weekend, and decided that there were not sufficient grounds to recommend any interference with the due course of law.[12]\\r\\nHaving been told that she would not be reprieved, Ellis dismissed her solicitor John Bickford (who had been chosen by Desmond Cussen) and asked to see Leon Simmons, the clerk to solicitor Victor Mishcon (whose law firm had previously represented her in her divorce proceedings but not in the murder trial). Simmons and Mishcon saw Bickford before going to Holloway; when Mishcon asked for a lead which might help save her, Bickford said \\"Ask her where she got the gun!\\". At 11.15?am on 12 July 1955, the day before her execution, Mishcon and Simmons saw Ellis, who wanted to make arrangements for her will. They pressed Ellis for the full story, which Ellis was reluctant to give; she asked Mishcon to promise not to use the information to try to secure a reprieve (Mishcon refused).[13]\\r\\nEllis then revealed that she had been drinking with Desmond Cussen for most of the weekend and that Cussen had given her the gun and some shooting practice. Cussen had also driven her to the murder scene. Following the two-hour interview in the condemned cell, Mishcon and Simmons went to the Home Office, where they spoke to a senior civil servant. The Permanent Secretary Sir Frank Newsam, who was at Ascot races, was summoned back to London, and ordered the head of CID to check the story.[14] Gwilym Lloyd George later said that the police were able to make considerable inquiries but that it made no difference to his decision, and in fact made Ellis's guilt greater by showing the murder was premeditated.[15] Lloyd George also explained that the injury to Gladys Yule was decisive in his decision not to reprieve Ellis: \\"We cannot have people shooting off firearms in the street! .. As long as I was Home Secretary I was determined to ensure that people could use the streets without fear of a bullet.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn a final letter to David Blakely's parents from her prison cell, she wrote \\"I have always loved your son, and I shall die still loving him.\\"[17]\\r\\nThirty seconds before 9?am on Wednesday 13 July, the official hangman, Albert Pierrepoint, and his assistant, Royston Rickard, entered the condemned cell at Holloway Prison and escorted Ruth 5 yards (4.6?m) to the execution room next door.[18] She had been weighed at 7?stone 5?pounds (47?kg; 103?lb) the previous day and a drop of 8?ft 4in (2.54 metres) was set. Pierrepoint carried out the execution in 12 seconds and her body was left hanging for an hour. Her autopsy report, by the pathologist Dr Keith Simpson, was made public.[19] Since Edith Thompson's execution in 1923, condemned female prisoners had been required to wear thick padded calico knickers.[20]\\r\\nThe Bishop of Stepney, Joost de Blank, visited Ellis just before her death, and she told him, \\"It is quite clear to me that I was not the person who shot him. When I saw myself with the revolver I knew I was another person.\\" These comments were quoted in a London evening paper of the time, The Star.\\r\\nThe case caused widespread controversy at the time, evoking exceptionally intense press and public interest to the point that it was discussed by the Cabinet.[21]\\r\\nOn the day of her execution, the Daily Mirror columnist Cassandra wrote a column attacking the sentence, writing \\"The one thing that brings stature and dignity to mankind and raises us above the beasts will have been denied herpity and the hope of ultimate redemption\\".[22] A petition to the Home Office asking for clemency was signed by 50,000 people, but the Conservative Home Secretary Major Gwilym Lloyd George rejected it.[22] The British Path newsreel reporting Ellis's execution openly questioned whether capital punishmentof a female or of anyonehad a place in the 20th century.[23]\\r\\nThe novelist Raymond Chandler, then living in Britain, wrote a scathing letter to the Evening Standard, referring to what he described as \\"the medieval savagery of the law\\".[24]\\r\\nThough the British public as a whole supported the execution of a murderess, the hanging helped strengthen public support for the abolition of the death penalty, which was halted in practice for murder in Britain ten years later (the last execution in the UK occurred in 1964). Reprieve was by then commonplace. According to one statistical account, between 1926 and 1954, 677 men and 60 women had been sentenced to death in England and Wales, but only 375 men and seven women had been executed.[26]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, John Bickford, Ellis's solicitor, made a statement to Scotland Yard from his home in Malta. He recalled that Desmond Cussen told him in 1955 that Ellis lied at the trial. Bickford had kept the information to himself. After Bickford's confession a police investigation followed but no further action regarding Cussen was taken.\\r\\nAnthony Eden, the Prime Minister at the time, made no reference to the Ellis case in his memoirs, nor is there anything in his papers. He accepted that the decision was the responsibility of the Home Secretary, but there are indications that he was troubled by it.[27]\\r\\nForeign newspapers observed that the concept of the crime passionnel seemed alien to the British.\\r\\nIn 1969 Ellis's mother, Berta Neilson, was found unconscious in a gas-filled room in her flat in Hemel Hempstead. She never fully recovered and did not speak coherently again. Ellis's husband, George Ellis, descended into alcoholism and committed suicide by hanging, at a Jersey hotel on 2nd August 1958.[citation needed] Her son, Andri, who was ten at the time of his mother's hanging, took his own life in a bedsit in 1982, shortly after desecrating his mother's grave. The trial judge, Sir Cecil Havers, had sent money every year for Andy's upkeep, and Christmas Humphreys, the prosecution counsel at Ellis's trial, paid for his funeral.[2] Ellis's daughter, Georgina, who was three when her mother was executed, was fostered by another family when her father killed himself three years later. She died of cancer aged 50.[28]\\r\\nThe case continues to have a strong grip on the British imagination and in 2003 was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The Court firmly rejected the appeal, although it made clear that it could rule only on the conviction based on the law as it stood in 1955, and not on whether she should have been executed.[29]\\r\\nThe court was critical of the fact that it had been obliged to consider the appeal:\\r\\nWe would wish to make one further observation. We have to question whether this exercise of considering an appeal so long after the event when Mrs Ellis herself had consciously and deliberately chosen not to appeal at the time is a sensible use of the limited resources of the Court of Appeal. On any view, Mrs Ellis had committed a serious criminal offence. This case is, therefore, quite different from a case like Hanratty [2002] 2 Cr App R 30 where the issue was whether a wholly innocent person had been convicted of murder. A wrong on that scale, if it had occurred, might even today be a matter for general public concern, but in this case there was no question that Mrs Ellis was other than the killer and the only issue was the precise crime of which she was guilty. If we had not been obliged to consider her case we would perhaps in the time available have dealt with 8 to 12 other cases, the majority of which would have involved people who were said to be wrongly in custody.[30]\\r\\nIn July 2007 a petition was published on the 10 Downing Street website asking Prime Minister Gordon Brown to reconsider the Ruth Ellis case and grant her a pardon in the light of new evidence that the Old Bailey jury in 1955 was not asked to consider. It expired on 4 July 2008.[31]\\r\\nEllis was buried in an unmarked grave within the walls of Holloway Prison, as was customary for executed prisoners. In the early 1970s, the prison was extensively rebuilt, during which the bodies of all the executed women were exhumed for reburial elsewhere. Ellis's body was reburied in the churchyard extension of St Mary's Church in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. The headstone in the churchyard was inscribed \\"Ruth Hornby 1926ÿ1955\\". Her son, Andy, destroyed the headstone shortly before he committed suicide in 1982.\\r\\nCoincidentally, Styllou Christofi, who was hanged in December 1954 for murdering her daughter-in-law (the second-to-last woman to be executed in Britain), lived at 11 South Hill Park in Hampstead,[32] with her son and daughter-in-law, a few yards from the Magdala public house at number 2a, where David Blakely was shot four months later.\\r\\nIn 1980, the third episode of the first series of the ITV drama series Lady Killers recreated the court case, with Ellis played by Georgina Hale.\\r\\nThe first cinema portrayal of Ellis came with the release of the 1985 film Dance with a Stranger, directed by Mike Newell and featuring Miranda Richardson as Ellis.\\r\\nBoth Ellis's story and the story of Albert Pierrepoint are retold in the stage play Follow Me, written by Ross Gurney-Randall and Dave Mounfield and directed by Guy Masterson. It premiered at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh as part of the 2007 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\\r\\nIn the film Pierrepoint (2006), Ellis was portrayed by Mary Stockley.\\r\\nDiana Dors, who had starred in Lady Godiva Rides Again, in which Ellis had had a minor, uncredited role, played a character resembling (though not based on) Ellis in the 1956 British film Yield to the Night, directed by J. Lee Thompson.[33][34]\\r\\nThe case was the basis for Amanda Whittington's play The Thrill of Love. It premiered at the New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, in February 2013 and subsequently played at St James Theatre London with Faye Castelow in the main role.[35] Maxine Peake played Ellis in an adaptation of Whittington's play, broadcast on 5 November 2016 by BBC Radio 4.[36]\\r\\nThe life of Ellis was the inspiration behind a musical play by Lucy Rivers, Sinners Club.[37] A co-production with Theatr Clwyd, it premiered at The Other Room Theatre in Cardiff, in February 2017.\\r\\nThe Ruth Ellis story was dramatised in the Murder Maps series of documentaries on the Yesterday Channel on 2 November 2017. It featured Monica Weller, ghost writer of Ruth Ellis My Sister's Secret Life.\\r\\nThe story was also the inspiration for the 2015 opera Entanglement by the composer Charlotte Bray.[38]\\r\\nThe case was re-examined by film-maker Gillian Pachter in the 2018 BBC Four documentary series The Ruth Ellis Files: A Very British Crime Story.[39]","input":"When was the last woman to be hanged in britain?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(M,[["render",x]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/28.md","filePath":"qapage/28.md"}'),F={name:"qapage/28.md"},N=Object.assign(F,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{D as __pageData,N as default};
