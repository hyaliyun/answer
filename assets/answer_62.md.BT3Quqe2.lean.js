A cladogram is not , however , an evolutionary tree because it does not show how ancestors are related to descendants , nor does it show how much they have changed ; many evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram . A cladogram uses lines that branch off in different directions ending at a clade , a groups of organisms with a last common ancestor . There are many shapes of cladograms but they all have lines that branch off from other lines . The lines can be traced back to where they branch off . These branching off points represent a hypothetical ancestor ( not an actual entity ) which can be inferred to exhibit the traits shared among the terminal taxa above it . This hypothetical ancestor might then provide clues about the order of evolution of various features , adaptation , and other evolutionary narratives about ancestors . Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters , DNA and RNA sequencing data and computational phylogenetics are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms , either on their own or in combination with morphology ."},{"query":"who wrote the hymn and can it be","short_answer":"Charles Wesley","abstract":"\`\` And Can It Be That I Should Gain ?

The electric current flows mainly at the \`\` skin '' of the conductor , between the outer surface and a level called the skin depth . The skin effect causes the effective resistance of the conductor to increase at higher frequencies where the skin depth is smaller , thus reducing the effective cross-section of the conductor . The skin effect is due to opposing eddy currents induced by the changing magnetic field resulting from the alternating current . At 60 Hz in copper , the skin depth is about 8.5 mm . At high frequencies the skin depth becomes much smaller . Increased AC resistance due to the skin effect can be mitigated by using specially woven litz wire . Because the interior of a large conductor carries so little of the current , tubular conductors such as pipe can be used to save weight and cost ."},{"query":"where is crestview florida located on the map","short_answer":"30 ° 45 ′ 15 '' N 86 ° 34 ′ 22 '' W \uFEFF / \uFEFF 30.75417 ° N 86.57278 ° W","abstract":"Crestview is a city in Okaloosa County , Florida , United States .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"under the rule of law in the united states the ends are more important than the means","short_answer":"","abstract":"The rule of law is the \`\` authority and influence of law in society , especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior ; ( hence ) the principle whereby all members of a society ( including those in government ) are considered equally ( rule of will , refer to any law in exchange with the lowest , in the society ) subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes '' .

These primaries and caucuses are staggered , generally beginning sometime in January or February , and ending about mid-June before the general election in November . State and local governments run the primary elections , while caucuses are private events that are directly run by the political parties themselves . A state 's primary election or caucus is usually an indirect election : instead of voters directly selecting a particular person running for President , they determine the number of delegates each party 's national convention will receive from their respective state . These delegates then in turn select their party 's presidential nominee . The first state in the United States to hold its presidential primary was New Hampshire in 1920 ."},{"query":"how many religions and languages are in india","short_answer":"","abstract":"Languages spoken in India belong to several language families , the major ones being the Indo - Aryan languages spoken by 75 % of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 20 % of Indians .

Stabilizing selection is the opposite of disruptive selection . Instead of favoring individuals with extreme phenotypes , it favors the intermediate variants . Stabilizing selection tends to remove the more severe phenotypes , resulting in the reproductive success of the norm or average phenotypes . This means that most common phenotype in the population is selected for and continues to dominate in future generations . Because most traits change little over time , stabilizing selection is thought to be the most common type of selection in most populations ."},{"query":"where did the giant rubber duck come from","short_answer":"Dutch","abstract":"Rubber Duck refers to any of several giant floating sculptures designed by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman .

Handed down on May 17 , 1954 , the Warren Court 's unanimous ( 9 -- 0 ) decision stated that \`\` separate educational facilities are inherently unequal . '' As a result , de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution . This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement , and a model for many future impact litigation cases . However , the decision 's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools , and the Court 's second decision in Brown II ( 349 U.S. 294 ( 1955 ) ) only ordered states to desegregate \`\` with all deliberate speed '' ."},{"query":"where was the first home economics conference held","short_answer":"Late in the 19th century","abstract":"Home economics , domestic science or home science is a field of study that deals with the economics and management of the home and community .

Children have to learn to distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units -- eventually meaningful units -- in order to acquire words and sentences . Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging : When you read , there are spaces between the words . No such spaces occur between spoken words . So , if an infant hears the sound sequence \`\` thisisacup , '' it has to learn to segment this stream into the distinct units \`\` this '' , \`\` is '' , \`\` a '' , and \`\` cup . '' Once the child is able to extract the sequence \`\` cup '' from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word . Furthermore , the child has to be able to distinguish the sequence \`\` cup '' from \`\` cub '' in order to learn that these are two distinct words with different meanings . Finally , the child has to learn to produce these words . The acquisition of native language phonology begins in the womb and is n't completely adult - like until the teenage years .

The Fourier transform of a function of time itself is a complex - valued function of frequency , whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function , and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic sinusoid in that frequency . The Fourier transform is called the frequency domain representation of the original signal . The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of time . The Fourier transform is not limited to functions of time , but in order to have a unified language , the domain of the original function is commonly referred to as the time domain . For many functions of practical interest , one can define an operation that reverses this : the inverse Fourier transformation , also called Fourier synthesis , of a frequency domain representation combines the contributions of all the different frequencies to recover the original function of time ."},{"query":"dust to dust earth to earth ashes to ashes","short_answer":"","abstract":"Dust to Dust may refer to :"},{"query":"what can a super pac spend money on","short_answer":"","abstract":"In the United States , a political action committee ( PAC ) is a type of organization that pools campaign contributions from members and donates those funds to campaign for or against candidates , ballot initiatives , or legislation .

White light from the sun is made up of a combination of colors that are broken apart by water droplets in a \`\` rainbow '' spectrum . Large quantities of water , even in a swimming pool , would appear blue as well . When light hits the water surface , the different colors are absorbed , transmitted , scattered , or reflected in differing intensities by water molecules and other so - called optically - active constituents in suspension in the upper layer of the ocean . The reason that open ocean waters often appear blue is due to the absorption and scattering of light . The blue wavelengths of light are scattered , similar to the scattering of blue light in the sky but absorption is a much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean water . In water , absorption is strong in the red and weak in the blue and so red light is absorbed quickly in the ocean leaving blue .

This results in lower emissions of sulfur dioxide , particulates , mercury , and in some cases carbon dioxide . With additional process equipment , a water - gas shift reaction can increase gasification efficiency and reduce carbon monoxide emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide . The resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated , compressed , and stored through sequestration . Excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a steam cycle , similar to a combined cycle gas turbine . This process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion ."},{"query":"what year was the court of criminal appeals originally established","short_answer":"1841","abstract":"The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ( CCA ) is the court of last resort for all criminal matters in the State of Texas , United States .

Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam 's state of polarization , optical activity can be observed in fluids . This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars , molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins , and also chiral liquid crystals . It can also be observed in chiral solids such as certain crystals with a rotation between adjacent crystal planes ( such as quartz ) or metamaterials . Rotation of light 's plane of polarization may also occur through the Faraday effect which involves a static magnetic field , however this is a distinct phenomenon that is not usually classified under \`\` optical activity .

Among stable nuclei and naturally occurring nuclei , this ratio generally increases with increasing atomic number . This is because electrical repulsive forces between protons scale with distance differently than strong nuclear force attractions . In particular , most pairs of protons in large nuclei are not far enough apart , such that electrical repulsion dominates over the strong nuclear force , and thus proton density in stable larger nuclei must be lower than in stable smaller nuclei where more pairs of protons have appreciable short - range nuclear force attractions ."},{"query":"when did han solo win the millennium falcon","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Millennium Falcon is a fictional starship in the Star Wars franchise .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"who played ainsley hayes on the west wing","short_answer":"Emily Mallory Procter","abstract":"Emily Mallory Procter ( born October 8 , 1968 ) is an American actress .

This term can be used formally or informally . In Western Europe and the Americas , abolitionism is a historical movement in effort to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free . King Charles I of Spain , usually known as Emperor Charles V , was following the example of Louis X of France who abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315 . He passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542 , although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states , and was not enforced . In the late 17th century , the Roman Catholic Church , taking up a plea by Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça , officially condemned the slave trade , which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 . The abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century , however , when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery . James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery , banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds , and arguing against it in Parliament , and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause .
