The antisense strand is thus responsible for the RNA that is later translated to protein , while the sense strand possesses a nearly identical makeup to that of the mRNA . Note that for each segment of dsDNA , there will possibly be two sets of sense and antisense , depending on which direction one reads ( since sense and antisense is relative to perspective ) . It is ultimately the gene product , or mRNA , that dictates which strand of one segment of dsDNA we call sense or antisense .

A contrast medium , usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water , is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract , and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest . The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film . This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx , larynx , esophagus , stomach , and small intestine such that the inside wall lining , size , shape , contour , and patency are visible to the examiner . With fluoroscopy , it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing , peristalsis , or sphincter closure . Depending on the organs to be examined , barium radiographs can be classified into barium swallow , barium meal , barium follow - through , and enteroclysis ( small bowel enema ) . To further enhance the quality of images , air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium , and this procedure is called double - contrast imaging . In this case the gas is referred to as the negative contrast medium . Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain - film radiography , but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast , in which case the procedure is called CT enterography ."},{"query":"what is the meaning of the song iko iko","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Iko Iko '' ( / ˈaɪkoʊ ˈaɪkoʊ / ) is a much - covered New Orleans song that tells of a parade collision between two tribes of Mardi Gras Indians and the traditional confrontation .

At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S.

From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) .

The membrane potential alters the conformation of the channel proteins , regulating their opening and closing . Cell membranes are generally impermeable to ions , thus they must diffuse through the membrane through transmembrane protein channels . They have a crucial role in excitable cells such as neuronal and muscle tissues , allowing a rapid and co-ordinated depolarization in response to triggering voltage change . Found along the axon and at the synapse , voltage - gated ion channels directionally propagate electrical signals . Voltage - gated ion - channels are usually ion - specific , and channels specific to sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , calcium ( Ca ) , and chloride ( Cl ) ions have been identified .

The myelinated axon can be likened to an electrical wire ( the axon ) with insulating material ( myelin ) around it . However , unlike the plastic covering on an electrical wire , myelin does not form a single long sheath over the entire length of the axon . Rather , each myelin sheath insulates the axon over a single section and , in general , each axon comprises multiple long myelinated sections separated from each other by short gaps . Each myelin sheath is formed by the concentric wrapping of an oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell process around the axon ."},{"query":"where is schitts creek supposed to be located","short_answer":"Canada","abstract":"Schitt 's Creek ( stylized as Schitt Creek ) is a Canadian television sitcom created by Eugene Levy and his son Daniel Levy , that premiered on CBC Television on January 13 , 2015 .

The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States .

They are a specific type of neutral mutation . The phrase silent mutation is often used interchangeably with the phrase synonymous mutation ; however , synonymous mutations are not always silent , nor vice versa . Synonymous mutations can affect transcription , splicing , mRNA transport , and translation , any of which could alter phenotype , rendering the synonymous mutation non-silent . The substrate specificity of the tRNA to the rare codon can affect the timing of translation , and in turn the co-translational folding of the protein . This is reflected in the codon usage bias that is observed in many species . Mutations that cause the altered codon to produce an amino acid with similar functionality ( e.g. a mutation producing leucine instead of isoleucine ) are often classified as silent ; if the properties of the amino acid are conserved , this mutation does not usually significantly affect protein function ."},{"query":"who sings in let you down with nf","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who does damon from vampire diaries end up with","short_answer":"Elena Gilbert","abstract":"Damon Salvatore is a fictional character in The Vampire Diaries novel series .

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . Essentially , the U.S. saw their major security interests being disturbed due to the rise of the communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it . Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3,812,000 .

It is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object . The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to conservative forces , the mechanical energy is constant . If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force , the potential energy will increase and if the speed ( not the velocity ) of the object is changed , the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well . In all real systems , however , nonconservative forces , like frictional forces , will be present , but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy 's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation . In elastic collisions , the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions , some mechanical energy is converted into heat . The equivalence between lost mechanical energy ( dissipation ) and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule ."},{"query":"what was the result of the civil war in england","short_answer":"","abstract":"Parliamentarian victory"},{"query":"who died in orange is the new black season 3","short_answer":"","abstract":"The third season of the American comedy - drama television series Orange Is the New Black premiered on Netflix on June 11 , 2015 , at 12 : 00 am PST in multiple countries .

Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium , the gel , where an electric field induces the nucleic acids ( which are negatively charged due to their sugar - phosphate backbone ) to migrate toward the anode ( which is positively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell ) . The separation of these fragments is accomplished by exploiting the mobilities with which different sized molecules are able to pass through the gel . Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel . Because the size of the molecule affects its mobility , smaller fragments end up nearer to the anode than longer ones in a given period . After some time , the voltage is removed and the fragmentation gradient is analyzed . For larger separations between similar sized fragments , either the voltage or run time can be increased . Extended runs across a low voltage gel yield the most accurate resolution . Voltage is , however , not the sole factor in determining electrophoresis of nucleic acids ."},{"query":"how many trees per acre were in the amazon rainforest 20 years ago","short_answer":"","abstract":"The cattle sector of the Brazilian Amazon , incentivized by the international beef and leather trades , has been responsible for about 80 % of all deforestation in the region , or about 14 % of the world 's total annual deforestation , making it the world 's largest single driver of deforestation .
