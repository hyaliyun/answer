Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"where are the golden knights going to play","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Vegas Golden Knights are a professional ice hockey team based in the Las Vegas metropolitan area .

Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors . He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits , and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by - product of natural selection or from selection on other traits . There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations . There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication , and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations . Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates , and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant , whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates , though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations ."},{"query":"what order do you read the ender's game series","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Ender 's Game series ( often referred to as the Ender saga and also the Enderverse ) is a series of science fiction books written by American author Orson Scott Card .

These series of surface gravity waves are not wind waves , which are generated by the immediate local wind , but instead are generated by distant weather systems , where wind blows for a duration of time over a fetch of water . This is the primary definition of a swell as opposed to a locally generated wind wave , which is still under the influence of the mechanisms that created it e.g. wind blowing over a puddle . More generally , a swell consists of wind - generated waves that are not -- or are hardly -- affected by the local wind at that time . Swell waves often have a long wavelength but this varies due to the size , strength and duration of the weather system responsible for the swell and the size of the water body e.g. wavelengths are rarely more than 150 m in the Mediterranean . Swell wavelength , also , varies from event to event . Occasionally , swells which are longer than 700 m occur as a result of the most severe storms . Swells have a narrower range of frequencies and directions than locally generated wind waves , because swell waves have dispersed from their generation area , have dissipated and therefore lost an amount of randomness , taking on a more defined shape and direction . Swell direction is the direction from which the swell is coming . It is measured in degrees ( as on a compass ) , and often referred to in general directions , such as a NNW or SW swell ."},{"query":"what was the longest shootout in nhl history","short_answer":"20 rounds","abstract":"Overtime is a method of determining a winner in an ice hockey game when the score is tied after regulation .

For example , it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved ( underlying ) variables . Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables . The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors , plus \`\` error '' terms . Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables . Followers of factor analytic methods believe that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset . Factor analysis is commonly used in biology , psychometrics personality theories , marketing , product management , operations research and finance . Users of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying / latent variables . It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality ."},{"query":"when was the first super mario game made","short_answer":"1985","abstract":"Super Mario Bros. is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System home console .

It is also less commonly known as a balanced parliament or a legislature under no overall control . If the legislature is bicameral , and the government is responsible only to the lower house , then \`\` hung parliament '' is used only with respect to that chamber . It is the objective of parliamentary systems for the parliament to be able to form a stable government , preferably one that lasts until the next election . This requires the government to be able to muster up sufficient votes in parliament to pass important legislation , especially the government 's budget . It also needs sufficient votes to defeat votes of no - confidence in the government . If the state of the parliament is such that a majority government can not be formed , the government may be referred to as a \`\` minority government '' . The term hung parliament is used mainly in systems with two parties or two party blocs . Most general elections in such a system will result in one or other party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government ; a \`\` hung parliament '' is an exception to this pattern , and may by some be considered anomalous or undesirable , and by others ideal as it blocks the dangers of absolute power .

Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence . This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm , yet productive work environment . This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective , which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement . An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee 's actual performance with the standards set . Ideally , when employees themselves have been involved with the goal - setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them , they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities . According to George S. Odiorne , the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals , define each individual 's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her , and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members ."},{"query":"what is the biggest mountain range in africa","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of the highest mountains of Africa .

Mimicry may evolve between different species , or between individuals of the same species . Often , mimicry evolves to protect a species from predators , making it an antipredator adaptation . The resemblances that evolve in mimicry can be in appearance , behaviour , sound or scent . Mimicry may be to the advantage of both organisms that share a resemblance , in which case it is a mutualism , or mimicry can be to the detriment of one , making it parasitic or competitive . Mimicry occurs when a group of organisms , the mimics , evolve to share perceived characteristics with another group , the models . The evolutionary convergence between groups is driven by the selective action of a signal - receiver or dupe . Birds , for example , use sight to identify palatable insects , whilst avoiding the noxious ones . Over time , palatable insects may evolve to resemble noxious ones , making them mimics and the noxious ones models . In the case of mutualism , sometimes both groups are referred to as \`\` co-mimics '' . It is often thought that models must be more abundant than mimics , but this is not always so . Mimicry may involve numerous species ; many harmless species such as hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps , while many such well - defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings , all resembling each other . Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves three or more species ."},{"query":"la cage aux folles musical i am what i am","short_answer":"","abstract":"La Cage aux Folles ( French pronunciation : ​ ( la kaʒ o fɔl ) ) is a musical with a book by Harvey Fierstein and lyrics and music by Jerry Herman .

The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE .
