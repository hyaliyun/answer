The electron and hole in the electron-hole pair can then move freely as electricity. However, if the electron-hole pair is not separated, the electron and hole can recombine, releasing a photon of the corresponding energy. To construct a solar cell from a semiconducting material and extract current during the excitation process, the electron and hole of the electron-hole pair must be separated. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, but the most common is with a p-n junction, where a positively doped (p-type) semiconducting layer and a negatively doped (n-type) semiconducting layer meet, creating a chemical potential difference that draws electrons one direction and holes the other, separating the electron-hole pair."},{"instruction":"What are the two main types of feeding in animal husbandry?","answer":"The two main types of feeding in animal husbandry are extensive, where animals roam at will and forage for themselves, and intensive, where animals are kept in high-density feedlots or cages and are fed energy and protein-rich foods."},{"instruction":"What is Saudi Aramco?","answer":"Saudi Aramco is the national oil company of Saudi Arabia, and it is one of the largest petroleum and natural gas companies in the world."},{"instruction":"Which religious leader or community is represented by Husain Burhanuddin at the Global Faith Leaders Summit?","answer":"Husain Burhanuddin represents the Dawoodi Bohra Community and its leader, His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin."},{"instruction":"Which country had the highest percentage of remaining forest cover in Central America in 2010?","answer":"Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover in Central America in 2010."},{"instruction":"How has climate change affected the frequency of high-tide flooding in Annapolis?","answer":"Annapolis had 18 days of high-tide (non-storm-related) flooding from May 2019 to April 2020, an increase from 12 days in 2018 and higher than the 1995-2005 average of 2 days annually."},{"instruction":"When did environmental organizations start to engage in international campaigning regarding climate change?","answer":"Environmental organizations started to engage in international campaigning regarding climate change in the late 1980s and early 1990s."},{"instruction":"When was Amgen founded and in which city?","answer":"Amgen was founded in 1980 in Thousand Oaks, California."},{"instruction":"What is Michael Oppenheimer's role in global science policy?","answer":"Michael Oppenheimer is a long-time participant in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and has served as a Coordinating Lead Author of the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

Subsea permafrost, which occurs beneath the seabed, also exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions and contains large stocks of organic matter and methane. Sea ice serves to stabilise methane deposits on and near the shoreline, preventing the clathrate from breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. Methane is released through bubbles from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean, and during storms, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. The size of today's subsea permafrost has been estimated at 2 million km2, which constitutes a 30–50% reduction since the LGM. Containing around 560 GtC in OM and 45 GtC in CH4, with a current release of 18 and 38 MtC per year respectively, which is due to the warming and thawing that the subsea permafrost domain has been experiencing since after the LGM (~14000 years ago)."},{"instruction":"What are some elective tracks in Environmental Engineering Science at the University of Florida?","answer":"The University of Florida offers several elective tracks in Environmental Engineering Science, including Process Engineering, Resource Engineering, Geoengineering, Ecology, Biology, and Policy.

Warmer water tends to cause more algal blooms, which can be unsightly, harm fish, and degrade water quality. Severe storms increase the amount of pollutants that run off from land to water, so the risk of algal blooms will be greater if storms become more severe. Increasingly severe storms could also cause sewers to overflow into lakes or rivers more often, threatening beach safety and drinking water supplies. Flooding is occasionally a problem for both navigation and riverfront communities, and greater river flows could make these problems worse. In the Red River watershed, river flows during the worst flood of the year have been increasing about 10 percent per decade since the 1920s. Floods are also becoming more severe in the upper Mississippi watershed. In June 2014, a flood forced two port facilities in St. Paul to stop operating, and barges waiting to unload had to be temporarily parked in Pigs Eye Lake until the river receded. Warmer winters reduce the number of days that ice prevents navigation. Between 1994 and 2011, the decline in ice cover lengthened the shipping season on the Great Lakes by eight days.

The report also notes that mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined on average in both hemispheres, and that losses from the land-based ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise between 1993 and 2003. Ocean warming causes seawater to expand, which contributes to sea level rising. Sea level rose at an average rate of about 1.8 mm/year during the years 1961–2003. The rise in sea level during 1993–2003 was at an average rate of 3.1 mm/year, but it is not clear whether this is a long-term trend or just variability.

The key observation is that, ordinarily, most of the chlorine in the stratosphere resides in 'reservoir' compounds, primarily chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) as well as stable end products such as HCl. The formation of end products essentially removes Cl from the ozone depletion process. The former sequester Cl, which can be later made available via absorption of light at shorter wavelengths than 400 nm.
