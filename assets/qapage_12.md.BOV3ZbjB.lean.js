Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is held at the same location, Augusta National Golf Club, a private course in the southeastern United States, in the city of Augusta, Georgia.\\r\\nThe Masters was started by noted amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts.[4] After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie.[1] First played 84?years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\\r\\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).[5] The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\\r\\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Palmer and Tiger Woods won four each, and five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.\\r\\nThe Augusta National course first opened 85?years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with Bobby Jones, who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game. He sought advice from Clifford Roberts, who later became the chairman of the club. They came across a piece of land in Augusta, Georgia, of which Jones said: \\"Perfect! And to think this ground has been lying here all these years waiting for someone to come along and lay a golf course upon it.\\"[7] The land had been an indigo plantation in the early nineteenth century and a plant nursery since 1857.[8] Jones hired Alister MacKenzie to help design the course, and work began in 1931. The course formally opened in 1933, but MacKenzie died before the first Masters Tournament was played.[9]\\r\\nThe first \\"Augusta National Invitational\\" Tournament, as the Masters was originally known, began on March 22, 1934, and was won by Horton Smith, who took the first prize of $1,500. The present name was adopted in 1939. The first tournament was played with current holes 10 through 18 played as the first nine, and 1 through 9 as the second nine[10] then reversed permanently to its present layout for the 1935 tournament.[4]\\r\\nInitially the Augusta National Invitational field was composed of Bobby Jones' close associates. Jones had petitioned the USGA to hold the U.S. Open at Augusta but the USGA denied the petition, noting that the hot Georgia summers would create difficult playing conditions.[11]\\r\\nGene Sarazen hit the \\"shot heard 'round the world\\" in 1935, holing a shot from the fairway on the par 5 15th for a double eagle (albatross).[12] This tied Sarazen with Craig Wood, and in the ensuing 36-hole playoff Sarazen was the victor by five strokes.[13] The tournament was not played from 1943 to 1945, due to World War II. To assist the war effort, cattle and turkeys were raised on the Augusta National grounds.[4]\\r\\nThe Big Three of Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus dominated the Masters from 1960 through 1978, winning the event 11 times among them during that span. After winning by one stroke in 1958,[13] Palmer won by one stroke again in 1960 in memorable circumstances. Trailing Ken Venturi by one shot in the 1960 event, Palmer made birdies on the last two holes to prevail. Palmer would go on to win another two Masters in 1962 and 1964.[13]\\r\\nJack Nicklaus emerged in the early 1960s, and served as a rival to the popular Palmer. Nicklaus won his first green jacket in 1963, defeating Tony Lema by one stroke.[14] Two years later, he shot a then-course record of 271 (17 under par) for his second Masters win, leading Bobby Jones to say that Nicklaus played \\"a game with which I am not familiar.\\"[15] The next year, Nicklaus won his third green jacket in a grueling 18-hole playoff against Tommy Jacobs and Gay Brewer.[16] This made Nicklaus the first player to win consecutive Masters. He won again in 1972 by three strokes.[13] In 1975, Nicklaus won by one stroke in a close contest with Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller in one of the most exciting Masters to date.[17]\\r\\nGary Player became the first non-American to win the Masters in 1961, beating Palmer, the defending champion.[13] In 1974, he won again by two strokes.[13] After not winning a tournament on the U.S. PGA tour for nearly four years, and at the age of 42, Player won his third and final Masters in 1978 by one stroke over three players.[13] Player currently shares (with Fred Couples) the record of making 23 consecutive cuts, and has played in a record 52 Masters.[18][19]\\r\\nA controversial ending to the Masters occurred in 1968. Roberto De Vicenzo signed a scorecard (scored by playing partner Tommy Aaron) which incorrectly showed him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round. By the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole. This extra stroke cost De Vicenzo a chance to be in an 18-hole Monday playoff with Bob Goalby, who won the green jacket. De Vicenzo's mistake led to the famous quote, \\"What a stupid I am.\\"[13][20]\\r\\nIn 1975, Lee Elder became the first African American to play in the Masters,[21] doing so 15 years before Augusta National admitted its first black member, Ron Townsend, as a result of the Shoal Creek Controversy.[22]\\r\\nNon-Americans collected 11 victories in 20 years in the 1980s and 1990s, by far the strongest run they have had in any of the three majors played in the United States since the early days of the U.S. Open. The first European to win the Masters was Seve Ballesteros in 1980. Nicklaus became the oldest player to win the Masters in 1986 when he won for the sixth time at age 46.[13][23]\\r\\nDuring this period, no golfer suffered from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman. In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters.[24] In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship).[25] Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force a Monday playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.\\r\\nAt age 21 in 1997, Tiger Woods won the Masters by twelve shots and broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years.[4] Woods completed his \\"Tiger Slam\\" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters in 2001.[13] He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history to win the tournament in consecutive years,[13] as well as in 2005 when he defeated Chris DiMarco in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.[13]\\r\\nThe club was targeted by Martha Burk, who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members. Burk planned to protest at the front gates of Augusta National during the third day of the tournament, but her application for a permit to do so was denied.[26] A court appeal was dismissed.[27] In 2004, Burk stated that she had no further plans to protest against the club.[28]\\r\\nAugusta National Chairman Billy Payne himself made headlines in April 2010, however, when he commented (at the annual pre-Masters press conference) on Tiger Woods' off-the-course behavior. \\"It's not simply the degree of his conduct that is so egregious here,\\" Payne said, in his opening speech. \\"It is the fact he disappointed all of us and more importantly our kids and grandkids.\\"[29][30][31]\\r\\nThe 2003 tournament was won by Mike Weir, who became the first Canadian to win a men's major championship, and the first left-hander to win the Masters.[13] The following year, another left-hander, Phil Mickelson, won his first major championship by making a birdie on the final hole to beat Ernie Els by a stroke.[13] Mickelson also won the tournament in 2006 and 2010. In 2011, the tournament was won by South African Charl Schwartzel, who birdied the final four holes to win by two strokes. In 2012, Bubba Watson won the tournament on the second playoff hole. Watson's win marked the fifth time that a left-hander won the Masters in the previous ten tournaments. Prior to 2003, no left-hander had ever won the Masters. The 2013 Masters was won by Adam Scott, the first Australian to win the tournament.[32] Watson won the 2014 Masters by three strokes over Jordan Spieth and Jonas Blixt. It was his second Masters victory in three years. In 2015, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in just his second Masters.[33]\\r\\nThe total prize money for the 2014 tournament was $9,000,000, with $1,620,000 going to the winner.[34] In the inaugural year of 1934, the winner Horton Smith received $1,500 out of a $5,000 purse.[35] After Nicklaus's first win in 1963, he received $20,000, while after his final victory in 1986 he won $144,000.[36][37] In recent years the purse has grown quickly. Between 2001 and 2014, the winner's share grew by $612,000, and the purse grew by $3,400,000.[34][35][38]\\r\\nIn addition to a cash prize, the winner of the tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\\r\\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);[39] Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedre?a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.[40][41]\\r\\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself.[16] When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of Augusta National put the jacket on them.\\r\\nThere are several awards presented to players who perform exceptional feats during the tournament. The player who has the daily lowest score receives a crystal vase, while players who score a hole-in-one or a double eagle win a large crystal bowl. For each eagle a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\\r\\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. They have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy, introduced in 1961, which depicts the clubhouse. This trophy remains at Augusta National; since 1993 winners have received a sterling silver replica. The runner-up receives a silver medal, introduced in 1951. Beginning in 1978, a silver salver was added as an award for the runner-up.[4]\\r\\nIn 1952 the Masters began presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.[4]\\r\\nIn 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.[42]\\r\\nIn 2013, Augusta National partnered with the USGA and the PGA of America to establish Drive, Chip and Putt, a youth golf skills competition which was first held in 2014. The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.[43][44][45]\\r\\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley announced that the club would host a new Women's amateur championship beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in Evans, Georgia, with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \\"greatest impact\\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the LPGA Tour's Dinah Shore major (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner Mike Whan, and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \\"win\\" for the LPGA over time.[46]\\r\\nThe Par 3 Contest was first introduced in 1960, and was won that year by Snead. Since then it has traditionally been played on the Wednesday before the tournament starts. The par 3 course was built in 1958. It is a nine-hole course, with a par of 27, and measures 1,060 yards (970?m) in length.[47]\\r\\nThere have been 94 holes-in-one in the history of the contest, with a record nine occurring in 2016. Camilo Villegas became the first player to card two holes-in-one in the same round during the 2015 Par 3 Contest. No par 3 contest winner has also won the Masters in the same year.[48][49] There have been several repeat winners, including Pdraig Harrington, Sandy Lyle, Sam Snead, and Tom Watson. The former two won in successive years.\\r\\nIn this event, golfers may use their children as caddies, which helps to create a family-friendly atmosphere. In 2008, the event was televised for the first time by ESPN.\\r\\nThe winner of the par 3 competition, which is played the day before the tournament begins, wins a crystal bowl.[50]\\r\\nAs with the other majors, winning the Masters gives a golfer several privileges which make his career more secure. Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to The Players Championship for five years.[51]\\r\\nBecause the tournament was established by an amateur champion, Bobby Jones, the Masters has a tradition of honoring amateur golf. It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current U.S. Amateur champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\\r\\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \\"Crow's Nest\\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is 1,200 square feet (110?m2) with lodging space for five during the competition.\\r\\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\\r\\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter. Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009.[52] At the 2010 and 2011 Masters Tournaments, Jack Nicklaus joined Palmer as an honorary co-starter for the event.[53] In 2012, Gary Player joined them. Palmer announced in March 2016 that a lingering shoulder issue would prevent him from partaking in the 2016 tee shot.[54] Palmer was still in attendance for the ceremony.[55]\\r\\nFollowing Palmer's death in 2016, the 2017 ceremony featured tributes; his green jacket was draped over an empty white chair, while everyone in attendance wore \\"Arnie's Army\\" badges.[56][57]\\r\\nThe Champions' Dinner is held each year on the Tuesday evening preceding Thursday's first round. The dinner was first held in 1952, hosted by defending champion Ben Hogan, to honor the past champions of the tournament.[58] At that time 15 tournaments had been played, and the number of past champions was 11. Officially known as the \\"Masters Club\\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\\r\\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served finely prepared cuisine by the Masters chef from their home regions. Notable examples have included haggis, served by Scotsman Sandy Lyle in 1989,[59] and bobotie, a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion Trevor Immelman. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion Fuzzy Zoeller created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of Phil Mickelson was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that Seve Ballesteros would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died weeks later.[60]\\r\\nUntil 1983, all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club caddie,[61][62][63] who by club tradition was always an African American man.[22] Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \\"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\\"[64] Since 1983, players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\\r\\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes. The surname, and sometimes first initial, of each player is found on the back of his caddie's uniform. The defending champion always receives caddie number \\"1\\": other golfers get their caddie numbers from the order in which they register for the tournament. The other majors and some PGA Tour events formerly had a similar policy concerning caddies well into the 1970s;[65][66][67] the U.S. Open first allowed players to use their own caddies in 1976.[68][69]\\r\\nThe day after the tournament closes, The Bobby Jones Scholars from The University of St Andrews in Scotland play a four-ball round on the course ÿ the last people to do so before the greenkeepers start the process of repairing and restoring the course to pre-tournament standard.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Masters is the first major championship of the year. Since 1948, its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times (1952, 1957, 1958, 1959) and the 1979 and 1984 tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.[4] The first edition in 1934 was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the 1942 event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.\\r\\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.[6]\\r\\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept in-tact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \\"make the cut\\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since 2013.[70] From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.[70] Before 1957, there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.[71]\\r\\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a sudden-death playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains. Adopted in 1976, the sudden-death playoff was originally formatted to start on the first hole,[72] but was not needed for the first three years. It was changed for 1979 to the inward (final) nine holes, starting at the tenth tee, where the television coverage began.[73] First employed that same year, the Masters' first sudden-death playoff ended on the eleventh green. The current arrangement, beginning at the 18th tee, was amended for 2004 and first used the following year. Through 2017, the eleven sudden-death playoffs have yet to advance past the second extra hole. Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in 1935, which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in 1970, and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\\r\\nThe golf course was formerly a plant nursery and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.[8]\\r\\nThe course layout in 2014:\\r\\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\\r\\nThe course was lengthened to 7,445 yards (6,808?m) in 2006. The first hole was shortened\\r\\nby 10 yards (9?m) in 2009, resulting in the current length of 7,435 yards (6,799?m).\\r\\nAs with many other courses, Augusta National's championship setup was lengthened in recent years. In 2001, the course measured 6,925 yards (6,332?m) and was extended to 7,270 yards (6,648?m) for 2002, and again in 2006 to 7,445 yards (6,808?m); 520 yards (475?m) longer than the 2001 course.[75][76] The changes attracted many critics, including the most successful players in Masters history, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Woods claimed that the \\"shorter hitters are going to struggle.\\" Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson was unperturbed, stating, \\"We are comfortable with what we are doing with the golf course.\\" After a practice round, Gary Player defended the changes, saying, \\"There have been a lot of criticisms, but I think unjustly so, now I've played it.... The guys are basically having to hit the same second shots that Jack Nicklaus had to hit (in his prime)\\".[77]\\r\\nOriginally, the grass on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, especially during the late 1970s, after the introduction of a healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain.[78] After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time.[78]\\r\\nJust before the 1975 tournament, the common beige sand in the bunkers was replaced with the now-signature white feldspar. It is a quartz derivative of the mining of feldspar and is shipped in from North Carolina.[79]\\r\\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the major championships, with 90ÿ100 players. Unlike other majors, there are no alternates or qualifying tournaments. It is an invitational event, with invitations largely issued on an automatic basis to players who meet published criteria. The top 50 players in the Official World Golf Ranking are all invited.[80]\\r\\nPast champions are always eligible, but since 2002 the Augusta National Golf Club has discouraged them from continuing to participate at an advanced age. Some will later become honorary starters.[81]\\r\\nMost of the top current players will meet the criteria of multiple categories for invitation. The Masters Committee, at its discretion, can also invite any golfer not otherwise qualified, although in practice these invitations are currently reserved for international players.[83]\\r\\nChanges for the 2014 tournament include invitations now being awarded to the autumn events in the PGA Tour, which now begin the wraparound season, tightening of qualifications (top 12 plus ties from the Masters, top 4 from the U.S. Open, Open Championship, and PGA Championship), and the top 30 on the PGA Tour now referencing the season-ending points before the Tour Championship, not the former annual money list.[70] The 2015 Masters added the winner of the newly established Latin America Amateur Championship, which effectively replaced the exemption for the United States Amateur Public Links Championship, which ended after the 2014 tournament. (The final Public Links champion played in the 2015 Masters.)[84]\\r\\nThe first winner of the Masters Tournament was Horton Smith in 1934, and he repeated in 1936. The player with the most Masters victories is Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have each won four, and Jimmy Demaret, Gary Player, Sam Snead, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson have three titles to their name. Player was the tournament's first overseas winner with his first victory in 1961. Two-time champions include Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, Jos Mara Olazbal, and Bubba Watson.[85]\\r\\nIn 1952 the Masters began presenting an award, known as the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur and then go on to win the Masters as a professional. These players are Cary Middlecoff, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Crenshaw, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Sergio Garca.\\r\\nJack Nicklaus has won the most Masters (six) and was 46?years, 82?days old when he won in 1986, making him the oldest winner of the Masters.[23] Nicklaus is the record holder for the most top tens, with 22, and the most cuts made, with 37.[71][87] The youngest winner of the Masters is Tiger Woods, who was 21?years, 104?days old when he won in 1997. In that year Woods also broke the records for the widest winning margin (12 strokes), and the lowest winning score, with 270 (?18). Jordan Spieth tied his score record in 2015.[88]\\r\\nIn 2013, Guan Tianlang became the youngest player ever to compete in the Masters, at age 14?years, 168?days on the opening day of the tournament;[89] the following day, he became the youngest ever to make the cut at the Masters or any men's major championship.[90]\\r\\nGary Player holds the record for most appearances, with 52. Player also holds the record for the number of consecutive cuts made, with 23 between 1959 and 1982 (Player did not compete in 1973 as he was recovering from recent surgery). He shares this record with Fred Couples, who made his consecutive cuts between 1983 and 2007, not competing in 1987 and 1994.[71]\\r\\nNick Price and Greg Norman share the course record of 63, with their rounds coming in 1986 and 1996 respectively.\\r\\nThe highest winning score of 289 (+1) has occurred three times: Sam Snead in 1954, Jack Burke, Jr. in 1956, and Zach Johnson in 2007. Anthony Kim holds the record for most birdies in a round with 11 in 2009 during his second round.[88]\\r\\nThere have been only four double eagles carded in the history of the Masters; the latest was by a contender in the fourth round in 2012. In the penultimate pairing with eventual champion Bubba Watson, Louis Oosthuizen's 260-yard (238?m) downhill 4 iron from the fairway made the left side of the green at the par-5 second hole, called Pink Dogwood, rolled downhill, and in.[91] The other two rare occurrences of this feat after Sarazen's double eagle on the fabled course's Fire Thorn hole in 1935: Bruce Devlin made double eagle from 248 yards (227?m) out with a 4-wood at the eighth hole (Yellow Jasmine) in the first round in 1967, while Jeff Maggert hit a 3-iron 222 yards (203?m) at the 13th hole (Azalea) in the fourth round in 1994.[92]\\r\\nThree players share the record for most runner-up finishes with four: Ben Hogan (1942, 1946, 1954, 1955), Tom Weiskopf (1969, 1972, 1974, 1975), Jack Nicklaus (1964, 1971, 1977, 1981)\\r\\nCBS has televised the Masters in the United States every year since 1956,[93] when it used six cameras and covered only the final four holes. Tournament coverage of the first eight holes did not begin until 1993 because of resistance from the tournament organizers, but by 2006, more than 50 cameras were used. Chairman Jack Stephens felt that the back nine was always more \\"compelling\\", increased coverage would increase the need for sponsorship spending, and that broadcasting the front nine of the course on television would cut down on attendance and television viewership for the tournament.[93][94][95] USA Network added first- and second-round coverage in 1982.[96] In 2008, ESPN replaced USA as broadcaster of early-round coverage. These broadcasts use the CBS Sports production staff and commentators, but with ESPN personality Scott Van Pelt (succeeding Mike Tirico, who replaced Bill Macatee's similar role under USA Network) as studio host.[97][96][98]\\r\\nIn 2005, CBS broadcast the tournament with high-definition fixed and handheld wired cameras, as well as standard-definition wireless handheld cameras. In 2006, a webstream called \\"Amen Corner Live\\" began providing coverage of all players passing through holes 11, 12, and 13 through all four rounds.[99] This was the first full tournament multi-hole webcast from a major championship. In 2007, CBS added \\"Masters Extra,\\" an extra hour of full-field bonus coverage daily on the internet, preceding the television broadcasts. In 2008, CBS added full coverage of holes 15 and 16 live on the web. In 2011, \\"Masters Extra\\" was dropped after officials gave ESPN an extra hour each day on Thursday and Friday. In 2016, the Amen Corner feed was broadcast in 4K ultra high definition exclusively on DirecTVas one of the first live U.S. sports telecasts in the format.[100][101] A second channel of 4K coverage covering holes 15 and 16 was added in 2017,[102] and this coverage was produced with high-dynamic-range (HDR) color in 2018.[103]\\r\\nWhile Augusta National Golf Club has consistently chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, it has done so in successive one-year contracts. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson stated that their relationship had gotten to the point where the contracts could be negotiated in just hours.[93] Due to the lack of long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least performs some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast.[104][105] Despite this, announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and Gary McCord,[104] and there also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests.[105]\\r\\nCoverage itself carries a more formal style than other golf telecasts; announcers refer to the gallery as patrons rather than as spectators or fans. Gallery itself is also used.[106] The club also disallows promotions for other network programs, or other forms of sponsored features.[106] Significant restrictions have been placed on the tournament's broadcast hours compared to other major championships. Only in the 21st century did the tournament allow CBS to air 18-hole coverage of the leaders, a standard at the other three majors.[104] Since 1982, CBS has used \\"Augusta\\" by Dave Loggins as the event telecast's distinctive theme music. Loggins originally came up with the song during his first trip to the Augusta course in 1981.[107]\\r\\nThe club mandates minimal commercial interruption, currently limited to four minutes per hour (as opposed to the usual 12 or more); this is subsidized by selling exclusive sponsorship packages to two or three companies ÿ currently these \\"global sponsors\\" are AT&T, IBM, and Mercedes-Benz.[106] AT&T (then SBC) and IBM have sponsored the tournament since 2005, joined at first by ExxonMobil, which in 2014 was replaced as a global sponsor by Mercedes-Benz.[108] In 2002, in the wake of calls to boycott tournament sponsors over the Martha Burk controversy, club chairman Hootie Johnson suspended all television sponsorship of the 2003 tournament. He argued that it was \\"unfair\\" to have the Masters' sponsors become involved with the controversy by means of association with the tournament, as their sponsorship is of the Masters and not Augusta National itself. CBS agreed to split production costs for the tournament with the club to make up for the lack of sponsorship. After the arrangement continued into 2004, the tournament reinstated sponsorships for 2005, with the new partners of ExxonMobil, IBM, and SBC.[109][110]\\r\\nThe club also sells separate sponsorship packages, which do not provide rights to air commercials on the U.S. telecasts, to two \\"international partners\\"; in 2014, those companies were Rolex and UPS (the latter of which replaced Mercedes-Benz upon that company's elevation to \\"global sponsor\\" status).[108]\\r\\nWestwoodOne (previously Dial Global and CBS Radio) has provided live radio play-by-play coverage in the United States since 1956. This coverage can also be heard on the official Masters website. The network provides short two- or three-minute updates throughout the tournament, as well as longer three- and four-hour segments towards the end of the day.[111]\\r\\nThe BBC has broadcast the Masters in the UK since 1986, and it also provides live radio commentary on the closing stages on Radio Five Live. With the 2007 launch of BBC HD, UK viewers can now watch the championship in that format. BBC Sport held the TV and radio rights through to 2010.[112] The BBC's coverage airs without commercials because it is financed by a licence fee. From the 2011 Masters, Sky Sports began broadcasting all four days, as well as the par 3 contest in HD and, for the first time ever, in 3D. The BBC will only have highlights of the first two days' play but will go head to head with Sky Sports, with full live coverage on the final two days of play.[113] In Ireland, Setanta Ireland previously showed all four rounds, and now since 2017 Eir Sport broadcast all four rounds live having previously broadcast the opening two rounds with RT broadcasting the weekend coverage.[114]\\r\\nIn Canada, broadcast rights to the Masters are held by Bell Media, with coverage divided between TSN (cable), which carries live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN coverage for all four rounds, CTV (broadcast), which simulcasts CBS's coverage of the weekend rounds, and RDS, which carries French-language coverage. Prior to 2013, Canadian broadcast rights were held by a marketing company, Graham Sanborn Media,[115] which in turn bought time on the Global Television Network, TSN, and RDS (except for 2012 when French-language coverage aired on TVA and TVA Sports) to air the broadcasts, also selling all of the advertising for the Canadian broadcasts. This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting, as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders, such as ESPN International (ESPN owns a minority stake in TSN). In 2013, Global and TSN began selling advertising directly, and co-produced supplemental programs covering the tournament (while still carrying U.S. coverage for the tournament itself).[116][117]\\r\\nOn December 15, 2015, TSN parent company Bell Media announced that it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to the tournament beginning 2016 under a multi-year deal. Broadcast television coverage moved to co-owned broadcast network CTV, while TSN uses its expanded five-channel service to carry supplemental feeds (including the Amen Corner feed and early coverage of each round) that were previously exclusive to digital platforms.[118][119]\\r\\nIn 53 countries, including much of Latin America, broadcast rights for the entire tournament are held by the ESPN International networks.[120]\\r\\nAlthough tickets for the Masters are not expensive, they are very difficult to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.[121]\\r\\nThe difficulty in acquiring Masters badges has made the tournament one of the largest events on the secondary-ticket market.[122] A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats. Some of these marketplaces will allow fans to purchase a Masters badge for a single day, as opposed to the traditional 4-day pass.[123]\\r\\nCoordinates: 333011N 820112W? / ?33.503N 82.020W? / 33.503; -82.020","input":"What is the lowest score in the masters?"},{"output":"Charlotte Amalie","context":"The United States Virgin Islands (USVI; also called the American Virgin Islands), officially the Virgin Islands of the United States, is a group of islands in the Caribbean that is an insular area of the United States located 40 miles (64?km) east of Puerto Rico. The islands are geographically part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles.\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas, and many other surrounding minor islands. The total land area of the territory is 133.73 square miles (346.36?km2).[3] The territory's capital is Charlotte Amalie on the island of Saint Thomas.\\r\\nPreviously known as the Danish West Indies of the Kingdom of DenmarkÿNorway, they were sold to the United States by Denmark in the Treaty of the Danish West Indies of 1916. They are classified by the United Nations as a Non-Self-Governing Territory, and are currently an organized, unincorporated United States territory. The U.S. Virgin Islands are organized under the 1954 Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands and have since held five constitutional conventions. The last and only proposed Constitution, adopted by the Fifth Constitutional Convention of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2009, was rejected by the U.S. Congress in 2010, which urged the convention to reconvene to address the concerns Congress and the Obama Administration had with the proposed document. The Fifth Constitutional Convention of the U.S. Virgin Islands met in October 2012 to address these concerns, but was not able to produce a revised Constitution before its October 31 deadline.\\r\\nIn 2010 the population was 106,405,[4] and mostly Afro-Caribbean. Tourism and related categories are the primary economic activity, employing a high percentage of the civilian non-farm labor force that totaled 42,752 persons in 2016. (The total non-farm labor force was 48,278 persons.) Private sector jobs made up 71 percent of the total workforce. The average private sector salary was $34,088 and the average public sector salary was $52,572.[5]\\r\\nIn a May 2016 report, some 11,000 people were categorized as being involved in some aspect of agriculture in the first half of 2016 but this category makes up a small part of the total economy. (The islands have a significant rum manufacturing sector.) At that time, there were approximately 607 manufacturing jobs and 1,487 natural resource and construction jobs. The single largest employer was the government.[6] In mid February 2017, the USVI was facing a financial crisis due to a very high debt level of $2 billion and a structural budget deficit of $110 million.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands were originally inhabited by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawaks. The islands were named by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over the next two hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain, Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, and DenmarkÿNorway.\\r\\nThe Danish West India Company settled on Saint Thomas in 1672, settled on Saint John in 1694, and purchased Saint Croix from France in 1733.[9] The islands became royal Danish colonies in 1754, named the Danish West Indian Islands (Danish: De dansk-vestindiske ?er). Sugarcane, produced by slave labor, drove the islands' economy during the 18th and early 19th centuries, until the abolition of slavery by Governor Peter von Scholten on July 3, 1848.\\r\\nThe Danish West India and Guinea Company are also credited with naming the island St. John (Danish: Sankt Jan). The Danish crown took full control of Saint John in 1754 along with St. Thomas and St. Croix. Sugarcane plantations such as the famous Annaberg Sugar Plantation were established in great numbers on St. John because of the intense heat and fertile terrain that provided ideal growing conditions. The establishment of sugarcane plantations also led to the buying of more slaves from Africa. In 1733, St. John was the site of one of the first significant slave rebellions in the New World when Akwamu slaves from the Gold Coast took over the island for six months.\\r\\nThe Danish were able to defeat the enslaved Africans with help from the French in Martinique. Instead of allowing themselves to be recaptured, more than a dozen of the ringleaders shot themselves before the French forces could capture them and call them to account for their activities during the period of rebel control. It is estimated that by 1775, slaves outnumbered the Danish settlers by a ratio of 5:1. The indigenous Caribs and Arawaks were also used as slave labor to the point of the entire native population being absorbed into the larger groups. Slavery was abolished in the Virgin Islands on July 3, 1848.\\r\\nAlthough some plantation owners refused to accept the abolition, some 5,000 Black people were freed while another 17,000 remained enslaved. In that era, slaves labored mainly on sugar plantations. Other crops included cotton and indigo. Over the following years, strict labor laws were implemented several times, leading planters to abandon their estates, causing a significant drop in population and the overall economy. In the late 1800s, numerous natural disasters added to worsen the situation.[10][better?source?needed] For the remainder of the period of Danish rule the islands were not economically viable and significant transfers were made from the Danish state budgets to the authorities in the islands. In 1867 a treaty to sell Saint Thomas and Saint John to the United States was agreed, but the sale was never effected.[11] A number of reforms aimed at reviving the islands' economy were attempted, but none had great success. A second draft treaty to sell the islands to the United States was negotiated in 1902 but was defeated in the upper house of the Danish parliament in a balanced ballot (because the opposition carried a 97-year-old life member into the chamber).[11]\\r\\nThe onset of World War I brought the reforms to a close and again left the islands isolated and exposed. During the submarine warfare phases of the war, the United States, fearing that the islands might be seized by Germany as a submarine base, again approached Denmark about buying them. After a few months of negotiations, a selling price of $25?million in United States gold coin was agreed, equivalent to $562.23?million in 2017 dollars. At the same time the economics of continued possession weighed heavily on the minds of Danish decision makers, and a consensus in favor of selling emerged in the Danish parliament.\\r\\nThe Treaty of the Danish West Indies was signed in August 1916,[12] with a Danish referendum held in December 1916 to confirm the decision. The deal was finalized on January 17, 1917, when the United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications. The United States took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 and the territory was renamed the Virgin Islands of the United States. Every year Transfer Day is recognized as a holiday, to commemorate the acquisition of the islands by the United States.[13] U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927. The U.S. dollar was adopted in the territory in 1934[14] and from 1935 to 1939 the islands were a part of the United States customs area.[15]\\r\\nWater Island, a small island to the south of St. Thomas, was initially administered by the U.S. federal government and did not become a part of the United States Virgin Islands territory until 1996, when 50 acres (20?ha) of land was transferred to the territorial government. The remaining 200 acres (81?ha) of the island were purchased from the United States Department of the Interior in May 2005 for $10, a transaction that marked the official change in jurisdiction.[16]\\r\\nHurricane Hugo struck the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1989, causing catastrophic physical and economic damage, particularly on the island of St. Croix. The territory was again struck by Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, killing eight people and causing more than $2 billion in damage. The islands were again struck by Hurricanes Bertha, Georges, Lenny, and Omar in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2008, respectively, but damage was not as severe in those storms. In 2017, Hurricane Irma caused catastrophic damage to St. John and St. Thomas; just days later, Hurricane Maria's eyewall crossed over St. Croix.\\r\\nUntil February 2012, the Hovensa plant located on St. Croix was one of the world's largest petroleum refineries and contributed about 20% of the territory's GDP. The facility stopped exporting petroleum products in 2014. In the final year of full refinery operations, the value of exported petroleum products was $12.7 billion (2011 fiscal year).[17] After being shut down, it has operated as no more than an oil storage facility; the closure had provoked a local economic crisis.[18][19]\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands are in the Atlantic Ocean, about 40 miles (60?km) east of Puerto Rico and immediately west of the British Virgin Islands. They share the Virgin Islands Archipelago with the Puerto Rican Virgin Islands of Vieques and Culebra (administered by Puerto Rico), and the British Virgin Islands.\\r\\nThe territory consists of three main islands: Saint Thomas, Saint John, and Saint Croix, as well as several dozen smaller islands. The main islands have nicknames often used by locals: \\"Twin City\\" (St. Croix), \\"Rock City\\" (St. Thomas) and \\"Love City\\" (St. John).[20] The combined land area of the islands is roughly twice the size of Washington, D.C.\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands are known for their white sand beaches, including Magens Bay and Trunk Bay, and strategic[clarification needed] harbors, including Charlotte Amalie and Christiansted. Like most Caribbean islands, the islands of the Virgin Islands, including Saint Thomas, are volcanic in origin and hilly. The highest point is Crown Mountain, Saint Thomas (1,555?ft or 474?m).\\r\\nSaint Croix, the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, lies to the south and has a flatter terrain due to being coral in origin. The National Park Service manages more than half of Saint John, nearly all of Hassel Island, and many acres of coral reef. (See also Virgin Islands National Park, Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, Buck Island Reef National Monument, Christiansted National Historic Site, and Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve.)\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands lie on the boundary of the North American plate and the Caribbean Plate. Natural hazards include earthquakes and hurricanes.\\r\\nThe United States Virgin Islands enjoy a tropical climate, with little seasonal change throughout the year. Rainfall is concentrated in the high sun period (May through October), while in the winter the northeast trade winds prevail. Summer and winter high temperatures differ by 5?F (3?C) or less on average.\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands are an organized, unincorporated United States territory. Although they are U.S. citizens, U.S. Virgin Islanders residing in the territory are ineligible to vote for the President of the United States. They are, however, eligible to vote if they become residents of mainland U.S. states.\\r\\nThe U.S. Democratic and Republican parties allow U.S. Virgin Islands citizens to vote in their presidential primary elections for delegates to the respective national conventions.[22]\\r\\nPeople born in the U.S. Virgin Islands derive their U.S. citizenship from Congressional statute.\\r\\nThe main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the Independent Citizens Movement, and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates run as independents.\\r\\nAt the national level, the U.S. Virgin Islands elect a delegate to Congress from their at-large congressional district. The elected delegate, while able to vote in committee, cannot participate in floor votes. The current House of Representatives delegate is Stacey Plaskett.\\r\\nAt the territorial level, fifteen senators ÿ seven from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large who must be a resident of Saint John ÿ are elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature. There is no limit as to the number of terms they can serve.[23]\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands have elected a territorial governor every four years since 1970. Previous governors were appointed by the President of the United States.\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands have a District Court, Superior Court and the Supreme Court. The District Court is responsible for federal law, while the Superior Court is responsible for U.S. Virgin Islands law at the trial level and the Supreme Court is responsible for appeals from the Superior Court for all appeals filed on or after January 29, 2007. Appeals filed prior to that date are heard by the Appellate Division of the District Court. Appeals from the federal District Court are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. District Court judges are appointed by the U.S. president, while Superior Court and Supreme Court judges are appointed by the governor.\\r\\nOn October 21, 1976, President Gerald Ford signed Pub.L. 94ÿ584 authorizing the people of the United States Virgin Islands to organize a government pursuant to a constitution, which would be automatically approved if Congress did not act within 60 days. On May 26, 2009 the U.S. Virgin Islands Fifth Constitutional Convention adopted a proposed Constitution of the Virgin Islands, which was submitted by President Barack Obama to Congress on March 1, 2010. On June 30, 2010, President Obama signed Pub.L. 111ÿ194 in which Congress rejected the proposed constitution and urged the constitutional convention to reconvene.\\r\\nAs of early 2017, the territory still did not have its own constitution. Little has been achieved on this front since 2009 when a proposed constitution was contested by the U.S. Justice Department on the grounds that the powers sought exceeded what would be considered allowable under territorial status.[24] In September 2012, the Fifth Constitutional Convention of the U.S. Virgin Islands was unable to come to a decision on the contents of a proposed constitution by the October 31 deadline.[25][26]\\r\\nAdministratively, the U.S. Virgin Islands are divided into three (3) districts and twenty (20) sub-districts.\\r\\nWhile a Danish possession, the Islands were divided into \\"quarters\\" (five on St. John and nine on St. Croix) which were further divided into many dozens of \\"estates\\". Estate names are still used to write addresses; estates and quarters are used in describing real estate, especially on St. John[27] and St. Croix.[28] More densely populated towns such as Frederiksted and Christiansted on St. Croix were historically referred to as \\"districts\\", in contrast to the surrounding plantation land.\\r\\nA 1993 referendum on status attracted only 31.4% turnout, and so its results (in favor of the status quo) were considered void. No further referenda have been scheduled since.\\r\\nIn 2004, the 25th Legislature of the Virgin Islands established the Fifth Constitutional Convention, a constitutional convention gathered in order to draft a new constitution. In June 2009, Governor John de Jongh, Jr. rejected the resulting constitutional draft, saying the terms of the document would \\"violate federal law, fail to defer to federal sovereignty and disregard basic civil rights.\\"[29] A lawsuit filed by members of the Convention to force Governor de Jongh to forward the document to President Barack Obama was ultimately successful. The President of the United States forwarded the proposal to Congresswhich then had 60 days to approve or reject the documentin May 2010, along with a report noting concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice and restating the issues noted by Governor de Jongh. A U.S. Congressional resolution disapproving of the proposed constitution and requesting that the Fifth Constitutional Convention reconvene to consider changes to address these issues was signed into law by President Obama on June 30, 2010.[30][31]\\r\\nMonths later, a federal lawsuit was filed in the Federal District Court of the Virgin Islands in 2011. The lawsuit claimed that the United States had to provide U.S. Virgin Islanders with the ability to be represented in Congress and vote for U.S. President. The case is Civil No. 3:11-cv-110, Charles v. U.S. Federal Elections Commission et al. (3:11-cv-00110-AET-RM). It alleged that racial discrimination present in an all-white and segregated U.S. Congress of 1917 was the impetus to deny the right to vote to a majority non-white constituency. The case was ultimately dismissed and closed on August 16, 2012 by District Judge Anne E. Thompson from the Federal District Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix.[32]\\r\\nThe Fifth Constitutional Convention of the U.S. Virgin Islands met in October 2012 but was not able to produce a revised Constitution before its October 31 deadline.[33][34]\\r\\nIn 2016, the United Nations's Special Committee on Decolonisation recommended to the UN's General Assembly that this larger body should assist in \\"decolonization\\" and help the people of the territory to \\"determine freely their future political status\\". Specifically, the Special Committee recommended that the \\"views of the people of the United States Virgin Islands in respect of their right to self-determination should be ascertained\\" and that the UN should \\"actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at assisting the people of the United States Virgin Islands with their inalienable right to self-determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination\\".[35]\\r\\nA 2012 Economic report from the US Census Bureau indicated a total of 2,414 business establishments generating $6.8 billion in sales, employing 32,465 people and paying $1.1 billion in payroll per year. Between 2007 and 2012, sales declined by $12.6 billion, or 64.9 percent. (In 2007, total sales were $19.5 billion and the number employed was 35,300.)[36]\\r\\nAccording to a report on the first half of 2016 by the VI Bureau of Economic Research, the unemployment rate was 11.5 percent. In May 2016 the islands' Bureau of Economic Research indicated that there were 37,613 non-agricultural wage and salary jobs in the islands. This report states that the \\"leisure and hospitality sector\\" employed an average of 7,333 people. The retail trade sector, which also serves many tourists, averaged another 5,913 jobs. Other categories which also include some tourism jobs include Arts and Entertainment (792 jobs), Accommodation and Food (6,541 jobs), Accommodation (3755 jobs), Food Services and Drink (2,766 jobs). A large percentage of the 37,613 non-farm workers are employed in dealing with tourists. Serving the local population is also part of the role of these sectors.[37]\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the territory was $24,704, and the median income for a family was $28,553 according to the 2010 Census. Males had a median income of $28,309 versus $22,601 for females. The per capita income for the territory was $13,139. About 28.7% of families and 32.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.7% of those less than 18 years old and 29.8% of those 65 or more years old. Nearly 70% of adults had at least a high school diploma and 19.2% had a bachelor's degree or higher.[38]\\r\\nAnalysts reviewing the economy often point to the closure of the HOVENSA oil refinery, the islands largest private sector employer, in early 2012 as having a major negative impact on the territory's economy. In late 2013, the Reserve Bank of New Yorks Research and Statistics Group pointed out that manufacturing employment dropped by 50 percent in May 2012, and by another 4 percent by November 2012, and that the GDP fell by 13 percent, \\"mainly due to an 80 percent drop-off in exports (mostly refined petroleum)\\". On the other hand, tourism and some other service industries were growing. As well, the 2010 census indicated that a relatively high share of the adult population is in the labor force: 66 percent, versus 65 percent on the mainland and well below 50 percent in Puerto Rico. The bottom line in this report however is that \\"it may also be worthwhile to look at the physical infrastructure and human capital built up over the years, with an eye toward using it for other types of productive economic activity\\".[39]\\r\\nA May 2016 report by Bloomberg expressed concern about the islands' tax-supported debt load.[40] By January 23, 2017 this had increased to $2 billion. That translated to a per capita debt of $19,000, which was higher than the per capita debt in Puerto Rico which was undergoing a severe financial crisis at the time. A Debtwire analyst writing in Forbes indicated that nothing short of a miracle would prevent a financial collapse.[7] Another area of concern was the structural budget deficit which was at $110 million in mid February 2017.[41] The government instituted a new law in March 2017 with new or increased taxes on rum, beer, tobacco products and sugary drinks, as well as internet purchases and timeshare unit owners.[42]\\r\\nTourism, trade, and other service-oriented industries are the primary economic activities, accounting for nearly 60% of the GDP. Approximately 2.5 million tourists per year visit, most arriving on cruise ships.[43] Such visitors do not spend large amounts of money ($146.70 each on average) but as a group, they contributed $339.8 million to the economy in 2012.[44]\\r\\nHowever, the travel industry warned in late 2014 that work needs to be done for USVI tourism practices to meet 21st century demands. \\"The needs of the community and the tourists may be diametrically opposed; however, for tourism to flourish cooperation is a necessity. From reduced energy costs to increased educational opportunities, from improved healthcare to a continued reduction in crime, these and many other challenges must be tackled. There is only now.\\"[44]\\r\\nAdditionally, the islands frequently are a starting point for private yacht charters to the neighboring British Virgin Islands. Euromonitor indicates that over 50 percent of the workforce is employed in some tourism-related work.[45]\\r\\nThe manufacturing sector consists of mainly rum distilling. The agricultural sector is small, with most food being imported. International business and financial services are a small but growing component of the economy. Most energy is also generated from imported oil, leading to electricity costs four to five times higher than the U.S. mainland.[46] The Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority[47] also uses imported energy to operate its desalination facilities to provide fresh water.\\r\\nThe CIA's World Factbook lists the value of federal programs and grants? $241.4 million in 2013, 19.7% of the territorys total revenues? and that \\"the economy remains relatively diversified. Along with the tourist industry, it appears that rum exports, trade, and services will be major income sources in future years\\".[48]\\r\\nThere are some military facilities and personnel on the islands, supported by the United States government:\\r\\nAlthough a public airport, Henry E. Rohlsen Airport has serviced aircraft from the United States Air Force, as well as the United States Army.\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands are located in the Atlantic Standard Time zone and do not participate in daylight saving time. When the mainland United States is on Standard Time, the U.S. Virgin Islands are one hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time. When the mainland United States is on daylight saving time, Eastern Daylight Time is the same as Atlantic Standard Time.\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands are an independent customs territory from the mainland United States and operate largely as a free port. U.S. citizens thus do not have to clear customs when arriving in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but do when traveling to the mainland. Local residents are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on U.S. Virgin Islands source income; they pay taxes to the territory equal to what their federal taxes would be if they lived in a state.[49]\\r\\nThe Henry E. Rohlsen International Airport serves St. Croix and the Cyril E. King International Airport serves St. Thomas and St. John.\\r\\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands is the only U.S. jurisdiction that drives on the left. This was inherited from what was then-current practice on the islands at the time of the 1917 transfer of the territory to the United States from Denmark. However, because most cars in the territory are imported from the mainland United States, the cars in the territory are left-hand drive.\\r\\nAs in other U.S. territories, U.S. Virgin Islands mail service is handled by the United States Postal Service, using the two-character state code \\"VI\\" for domestic mail delivery.[50][51][52] ZIP codes are in the 008xx range.[52] As of January 2010[update], specifically assigned codes include 00801ÿ00805 (St Thomas),[53] 00820ÿ00824 (Christiansted),[54] 00830ÿ00831 (St John),[55] 00840ÿ00841 (Frederiksted),[56] and 00850ÿ00851 (Kingshill).[57] The islands are part of the North American Numbering Plan, using area code 340, and island residents and visitors are able to call most toll-free U.S. numbers.[50]\\r\\nIn 2010 the U.S. Virgin Islands had a population of 106,405.[58][59] There are 40,648 households, and 26,636 families.\\r\\nIn 2010 there were 40,648 households out of which 34.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 33.2% were married couples living together, 24.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.5% were non-families. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.34.\\r\\nIn the territory, the population in 2010 was distributed with 31.6% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 24.9% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and up, there were 87.7 males. The annual population growth is ?0.12%.\\r\\nThe literacy rate for the adult population was 94.9% in 2010.[60]\\r\\nThe racial makeup of the U.S. Virgin Islands was:[61]\\r\\nMany residents can trace their ancestry to other Caribbean islands, especially Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles. The territory is largely Afro-Caribbean in origin.[3]\\r\\nEnglish is currently the dominant language and Spanish is spoken by about 17% of the population. Other languages are spoken by 11% of the population.[62] English has been the predominant language since 1917 when the islands were transferred from Denmark to the United States. Under Danish rule, the official language was Danish, but it was solely the language of administration and spoken by Danes, a tiny minority of the overall population that primarily occupied administrative roles in colonial Danish West Indian society. However, place names and surnames of Denmark-Norway origins still remain among natives.\\r\\nAlthough the U.S. Virgin Islands was a Danish possession during most of its colonial history, Danish never was a spoken language among the populace, black or white, as the majority of plantation and slave owners were of Dutch, English, Scottish or Irish descent.[63] Even during Danish ownership, Dutch was more common, at least during some of those 245 years, specifically on St. Thomas and St. John. In St. Croix, English was the dominant language. St. Croix was owned by the French until 1733 when the island was sold to the Danish West Indian and Guinea Company. By 1741 there were five times as many English on the island as Danes. English Creole emerged on St. Croix more so than Dutch Creole, which was more popular on St. Thomas and St. John. Other languages spoken in the Danish West Indies included Irish, Scots, Spanish, and French, as well as Virgin Islands English Creole.[64]\\r\\nVirgin Islands Creole English, an English-based creole locally known as \\"dialect\\", is spoken in informal situations. The form of Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix, known as Crucian, is slightly different from that spoken on St. Thomas and St. John. Because the U.S. Virgin Islands are home to thousands of immigrants from across the Caribbean, Spanish and various French creole languages are also widely spoken.\\r\\nAs of the 2000 census, 25.3% of persons over the age of five speak a language other than English at home. Spanish is spoken by 16.8% of the population and French is spoken by 6.6%.[65][66]\\r\\nReligions: in the United States Virgin Islands (2010)[67]\\r\\nChristianity is the dominant religion in the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to Pew Research Center, 94.8% of the population was Christian in 2010.[68] Baptist, Roman Catholic and Episcopalian were the largest denominations in the 2010 Census.[69] Protestantism is the most widespread of the religious categories, reflecting the territory's Danish and Norwegian colonial heritage and more recently, it being a part of the United States. There is also a strong Roman Catholic presence. Rastafari is also prevalent.\\r\\nSaint Thomas is home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the Western Hemisphere as Sephardic Jews began to settle the island in the 18th century as traders and merchants. The St. Thomas Synagogue in Charlotte Amalie is the second oldest synagogue on American soil and oldest in terms of continuous usage.[70]\\r\\nIn 2010, the national average life expectancy was 79.61 years. It was 76.57 years for men and 82.83 for women.[71]\\r\\nThe United States Virgin Islands Department of Education serves as the territory's education agency, and has two school districts: St. Thomas-St. John School District and St. Croix School District.[72]\\r\\nThe University of the Virgin Islands provides higher education leading to associate's, bachelor's, and master's degrees, with campuses on St. Thomas and St. Croix.\\r\\nThe culture of the Virgin Islands reflects the various people that have inhabited the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands, both despite their political separation having kept close cultural ties. The culture derives chiefly from West African, European and American cultures, in addition to the influences from the immigrants from the Arab world, India and other Caribbean islands. The island was strongly influenced by the Dutch,[73] French and Danish during the periods of control the island were under these powers.\\r\\nThe islands have a number of AM and FM radio stations (mostly on St. Thomas and St. Croix) broadcasting music, religious, and news programming. (See List of radio stations in U.S. Territories.) Full and low-power television stations are split between St. Thomas and St. Croix. (See List of television stations in the U.S. Virgin Islands.)

The Secretary General is responsible for coordinating the workings of the alliance, leading NATO's international staff, chairing the meetings of the North Atlantic Council and most major committees of the alliance, with the notable exception of the NATO Military Committee, and acting as NATO's spokesperson.[1] However, the Secretary General does not have any military command role, and political, military and strategic decisions ultimately rest with the member states. Together with the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee and the Supreme Allied Commander the Secretary General is one of the foremost officials of NATO. The current Secretary General is Jens Stoltenberg, the former Prime Minister of Norway, who took office on 1 October 2014.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 9 of the North Atlantic Treaty requires NATO members to \\"establish a Council, on which each of them shall be represented.\\"[3] Accordingly, the North Atlantic Council was formed. Initially the Council consisted of NATO members' foreign ministers and met annually.[4] In May 1950, the desire for closer coordination on a day-to-day basis led to the appointment of Council deputies, permanently based in London and overseeing the workings of the organization. Deputies were given full decision-making authority within the North Atlantic Council, but their work was supplemented by occasional meetings of the NATO foreign ministers.[5] The Chairman of the deputies was given responsibility \\"for directing the organization and its work,\\" including all of its civilian agencies.[6]\\r\\nThe Council deputies met for the first time on July 25, 1950, and selected Charles Spofford, the United States deputy, as their chairman.[7] Several important organisational changes quickly followed the establishment of Council deputies, most notably the establishment of a unified military command under a single Supreme Allied Commander.[8] This unification and the growing challenges facing NATO led to rapid growth in the institutions of the organisation and in 1951, NATO was reorganized to streamline and centralize its bureaucracy. As part of the organization, the Council deputies were delegated with the authority to represent their governments in all matters, including those related to defense and finance, not just foreign affairs, greatly increasing their power and importance.[9]\\r\\nAs the authority of the deputies increased, and the size of the organization grew, NATO established the Temporary Council Committee, chaired by W. Averell Harriman. This group established an official secretariat in Paris to command NATO's bureaucracy.[10] The committee also recommended that \\"the agencies of NATO needed to be strengthened and co-ordinate\\", and emphasized the need for someone other than the Chairman of the North Atlantic Council to become the senior leader of the alliance.[11] In February 1952, North Atlantic Council accordingly established the position of Secretary General to manage all civilian agencies of the organization, control its civilian staff, and serve the North Atlantic Council.[12]\\r\\nAfter the Lisbon Conference, the NATO states began looking for a person who could fill the role of Secretary General. The position was first offered to Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the United States, but he declined. Then, on March 12, 1952, the North Atlantic Council selected Hastings Ismay, a general from World War II, and Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in the British cabinet as Secretary General.[13] Unlike later Secretaries General who served as Chairman of the North Atlantic Council, Ismay was made the Vice Chairman of the Council, with Spofford continuing to serve as chairman. Ismay was selected because of his high rank in the war, and his role \\"at the side of Churchill ... in the highest Allied Councils.\\" As both a soldier and a diplomat, he was considered uniquely qualified for the position, and enjoyed the full support of all the NATO states.[14]\\r\\nSeveral months later, after Spofford retired from the NATO, the structure of the North Atlantic Council was changed slightly. One member of the Council was selected annually as the President of the North Atlantic Council (a largely ceremonial role), and the Secretary General officially became the Deputy President of the Council, as well as the chair of its meetings.[15] Ismay served as Secretary General until retiring in May, 1957.[16]\\r\\nAfter Ismay, Paul-Henri Spaak, an international diplomat and former Prime Minister of Belgium was selected as the second Secretary General. Unlike Ismay, Spaak had no military experience, so his appointment represented a \\"deemphasis of the strictly military side of the Atlantic Alliance.\\"[17] When confirming Spaak's appointment in December 1956 during a session of the NATO foreign ministers, the North Atlantic Council also expanded the role of the Secretary General in the organization. Largely as a result of the Suez Crisis, which had strained intra-alliance relations, the Council issued a resolution to allow the Secretary General \\"to offer his good officers informally at any time to member governments involved in a dispute and with their consent to initiate or facilitate procedures of inquiry, mediation, conciliation, or arbitration.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe NATO Secretary General chairs several of the senior decision-making bodies of NATO. In addition to the North Atlantic Council, he chairs the Defence Planning Committee and the Nuclear Planning Committee, two of NATO's important military organizations. The Secretary General also leads the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the Mediterranean Cooperation Group, and serves as Join Chairman of the Permanent Joint Council and the NATO-Ukraine Commission.\\r\\nIn a second role, the Secretary General leads the staff of NATO. He directs the International Staff of the organization, and the Office of the Secretary General. The Secretary General also directs his or her own Private Office. All of these bodies draw personnel from all members of NATO, so the Secretary General must carefully coordinate.[19] For assistance in his responsibilities, the Secretary General also has a deputy appointed by the organization.\\r\\nThere is no formal process for selecting the Secretary General. Instead, the members of NATO traditionally reach a consensus on who should serve next. This procedure often takes place through informal diplomatic channels, but it still can become contentious. For example, in 2009, controversy arose over the choice of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as Secretary-General, due to opposition from Turkey.[20]\\r\\nBecause NATO's chief military officer, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, is traditionally an American, the Secretary General has traditionally been a European. There is nothing to preclude a Canadian or American from becoming the Secretary General, but everyone to occupy the post to date has been European.[21]","input":"Who is the current secretary general of nato?"},{"output":"Germany","context":"The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. The most recent World Cup, hosted by Brazil in 2014, was won by Germany, who beat Argentina 1ÿ0 after extra time.[1]\\r\\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is declared world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions.[2] The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2ÿ1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions.

The novel has inspired several film adaptations, most notably The Blue Lagoon starring Brooke Shields as Emmeline and Christopher Atkins as Richard (\\"Dicky\\" in the book).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story centers on two cousins, Dicky and Emmeline Lestrange, who are marooned with a galley cook on an island in the South Pacific following a shipwreck. The galley cook, Paddy Button, assumes responsibility for the children and teaches them how to survive, cautioning them to avoid the \\"arita\\" berries, which he calls \\"the never-wake-up berries.\\"\\r\\nTwo-and-a-half years after the shipwreck, Paddy dies following a drinking binge.

Neutrons and protons, both nucleons, are affected by the nuclear force almost identically. Since protons have charge +1?e, they experience an electric force that tends to push them apart, but at short range the attractive nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force.  The nuclear force binds nucleons into atomic nuclei.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force is powerfully attractive between nucleons at distances of about 1?femtometre (fm, or 1.0 G 10?15 metres), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5?fm. At distances less than 0.7?fm, the nuclear force becomes repulsive. This repulsive component is responsible for the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows. By comparison, the size of an atom, measured in angstroms (?, or 1.0 G 10?10 m), is five orders of magnitude larger. The nuclear force is not simple, however, since it depends on the nucleon spins, has a tensor component, and may depend on the relative momentum of the nucleons.[2]   The strong nuclear force is one of the fundamental forces of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force plays an essential role in storing energy that is used in nuclear power and nuclear weapons.  Work (energy) is required to bring charged protons together against their electric repulsion.  This energy is stored when the protons and neutrons are bound together by the nuclear force to form a nucleus.  The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum total of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons.  The difference in masses is known as the mass defect, which can be expressed as an energy equivalent. Energy is released when a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two or more lighter nuclei.  This energy is the electromagnetic potential energy that is released when the nuclear force no longer holds the charged nuclear fragments together.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA quantitative description of the nuclear force relies on equations that are partly empirical.  These equations model the internucleon potential energies, or potentials. (Generally, forces within a system of particles can be more simply modeled by describing the system's potential energy; the negative gradient of a potential is equal to the vector force.) The constants for the equations are phenomenological, that is, determined by fitting the equations to experimental data. The internucleon potentials attempt to describe the properties of nucleonÿnucleon interaction. Once determined, any given potential can be used in, e.g., the Schr?dinger equation to determine the quantum mechanical properties of the nucleon system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of the neutron in 1932 revealed that atomic nuclei were made of protons and neutrons, held together by an attractive force. By 1935 the nuclear force was conceived to be transmitted by particles called mesons. This theoretical development included a description of the Yukawa potential, an early example of a nuclear potential. Mesons, predicted by theory, were discovered experimentally in 1947. By the 1970s, the quark model had been developed, by which the mesons and nucleons were viewed as composed of quarks and gluons. By this new model, the nuclear force, resulting from the exchange of mesons between neighboring nucleons, is a residual effect of the strong force.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the nuclear force is usually associated with nucleons, more generally this force is felt between hadrons, or particles composed of quarks. At small separations between nucleons (less than ~ 0.7?fm between their centers, depending upon spin alignment) the force becomes repulsive, which keeps the nucleons at a certain average separation, even if they are of different types. This repulsion arises from the Pauli exclusion force for identical nucleons (such as two neutrons or two protons). A Pauli exclusion force also occurs between quarks of the same type within nucleons, when the nucleons are different (a proton and a neutron, for example).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt distances larger than 0.7?fm the force becomes attractive between spin-aligned nucleons, becoming maximal at a centerÿcenter distance of about 0.9?fm. Beyond this distance the force drops exponentially, until beyond about 2.0?fm separation, the force is negligible. Nucleons have a radius of about 0.8?fm.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt short distances (less than 1.7?fm or so), the attractive nuclear force is stronger than the repulsive Coulomb force between protons; it thus overcomes the repulsion of protons within the nucleus. However, the Coulomb force between protons has a much greater range as it varies as the inverse square of the charge separation, and Coulomb repulsion thus becomes the only significant force between protons when their separation exceeds about 2 to 2.5?fm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force has a spin-dependent component. The force is stronger for particles with their spins aligned than for those with their spins anti-aligned. If two particles are the same, such as two neutrons or two protons, the force is not enough to bind the particles, since the spin vectors of two particles of the same type must point in opposite directions when the particles are near each other and are (save for spin) in the same quantum state. This requirement for fermions stems from the Pauli exclusion principle. For fermion particles of different types, such as a proton and neutron, particles may be close to each other and have aligned spins without violating the Pauli exclusion principle, and the nuclear force may bind them (in this case, into a deuteron), since the nuclear force is much stronger for spin-aligned particles. But if the particles' spins are anti-aligned the nuclear force is too weak to bind them, even if they are of different types.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force also has a tensor component which depends on the interaction between the nucleon spins and the angular momentum of the nucleons, leading to deformation from a simple spherical shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo disassemble a nucleus into unbound protons and neutrons requires work against the nuclear force. Conversely, energy is released when a nucleus is created from free nucleons or other nuclei: the nuclear binding energy. Because of massÿenergy equivalence (i.e. Einstein's famous formula E = mc2), releasing this energy causes the mass of the nucleus to be lower than the total mass of the individual nucleons, leading to the so-called \\"mass defect\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force is nearly independent of whether the nucleons are neutrons or protons. This property is called charge independence. The force depends on whether the spins of the nucleons are parallel or antiparallel, as it has a non-central or tensor component. This part of the force does not conserve orbital angular momentum, which under the action of central forces is conserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symmetry resulting in the strong force, proposed by Werner Heisenberg, is that protons and neutrons are identical in every respect, other than their charge. This is not completely true, because neutrons are a tiny bit heavier, but it is an approximate symmetry. Protons and neutrons are therefore viewed as the same particle, but with different isospin quantum number[clarification needed]. The strong force is invariant under SU(2) transformations, just as are particles with intrinsic spin. Isospin and intrinsic spin are related under this SU(2) symmetry group. There are only strong attractions when the total isospin is 0, which is confirmed by experiment.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOur understanding of the nuclear force is obtained by scattering experiments and the binding energy of light nuclei.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force occurs by the exchange of virtual light mesons, such as the virtual pions, as well as two types of virtual mesons with spin (vector mesons), the rho mesons and the omega mesons. The vector mesons account for the spin-dependence of the nuclear force in this \\"virtual meson\\" picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force is distinct from what historically was known as the weak nuclear force. The weak interaction is one of the four fundamental interactions, and plays a role in such processes as beta decay. The weak force plays no role in the interaction of nucleons, though it is responsible for the decay of neutrons to protons and vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force has been at the heart of nuclear physics ever since the field was born in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick. The traditional goal of nuclear physics is to understand the properties of atomic nuclei in terms of the 'bare' interaction between pairs of nucleons, or nucleonÿnucleon forces (NN forces).\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin months after the discovery of the neutron, Werner Heisenberg[8][9][10] and Dmitri Ivanenko[11] had proposed protonÿneutron models for the nucleus.[12] Heisenberg approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics, an approach that was not at all obvious at the time. Heisenberg's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a \\"major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system.\\"[13] Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons. He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear isospin quantum numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the earliest models for the nucleus was the liquid drop model developed in the 1930s. One property of nuclei is that the average binding energy per nucleon is approximately the same for all stable nuclei, which is similar to a liquid drop. The liquid drop model treated the nucleus as a drop of incompressible nuclear fluid, with nucleons behaving like molecules in a liquid. The model was first proposed by George Gamow and then developed by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizs?cker. This crude model did not explain all the properties of the nucleus, but it did explain the spherical shape of most nuclei. The model also gave good predictions for the nuclear binding energy of nuclei.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1934, Hideki Yukawa made the earliest attempt to explain the nature of the nuclear force. According to his theory, massive bosons (mesons) mediate the interaction between two nucleons. Although, in light of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), meson theory is no longer perceived as fundamental, the meson-exchange concept (where hadrons are treated as elementary particles) continues to represent the best working model for a quantitative NN potential. The Yukawa potential (also called a screened Coulomb potential) is a potential of the form\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere g is a magnitude scaling constant, i.e., the amplitude of potential, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mu }\\r\\n\\r\\n is the Yukawa particle mass, r is the radial distance to the particle. The potential is monotone increasing, implying that the force is always attractive. The constants are determined empirically. The Yukawa potential depends only on the distance between particles, r, hence it models a central force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 1930s a group at Columbia University led by I. I. Rabi developed magnetic resonance techniques to determine the magnetic moments of nuclei. These measurements led to the discovery in 1939 that the deuteron also possessed an electric quadrupole moment.[14][15] This electrical property of the deuteron had been interfering with the measurements by the Rabi group. The deuteron, composed of a proton and a neutron, is one of the simplest nuclear systems. The discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. In particular, the result showed that the nuclear force was not a central force, but had a tensor character.[1] Hans Bethe identified the discovery of the deuteron's quadrupole moment as one of the important events during the formative years of nuclear physics.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the task of describing the nuclear force phenomenologically was formidable. The first semi-empirical quantitative models came in the mid-1950s,[1] such as the WoodsÿSaxon potential (1954). There was substantial progress in experiment and theory related to the nuclear force in the 1960s and 1970s. One influential model was the Reid potential (1968).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, experimenters have concentrated on the subtleties of the nuclear force, such as its charge dependence, the precise value of the NN coupling constant, improved phase shift analysis, high-precision NN data, high-precision NN potentials, NN scattering at intermediate and high energies, and attempts to derive the nuclear force from QCD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear force is a residual effect of the more fundamental strong force, or strong interaction. The strong interaction is the attractive force that binds the elementary particles called quarks together to form the nucleons (protons and neutrons) themselves. This more powerful force is mediated by particles called gluons. Gluons hold quarks together with a force like that of electric charge, but of far greater strength. Quarks, gluons and their dynamics are mostly confined within nucleons, but residual influences extend slightly beyond nucleon boundaries to give rise to the nuclear force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear forces arising between nucleons are analogous to the forces in chemistry between neutral atoms or molecules called London forces. Such forces between atoms are much weaker than the attractive electrical forces that hold the atoms themselves together (i.e., that bind electrons to the nucleus), and their range between atoms is shorter, because they arise from small separation of charges inside the neutral atom. Similarly, even though nucleons are made of quarks in combinations which cancel most gluon forces (they are \\"color neutral\\"), some combinations of quarks and gluons nevertheless leak away from nucleons, in the form of short-range nuclear force fields that extend from one nucleon to another nearby nucleon. These nuclear forces are very weak compared to direct gluon forces (\\"color forces\\" or strong forces) inside nucleons, and the nuclear forces extend only over a few nuclear diameters, falling exponentially with distance. Nevertheless, they are strong enough to bind neutrons and protons over short distances, and overcome the electrical repulsion between protons in the nucleus.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, the nuclear force is called the residual strong force, in contrast to the strong interactions which arise from QCD. This phrasing arose during the 1970s when QCD was being established. Before that time, the strong nuclear force referred to the inter-nucleon potential. After the verification of the quark model, strong interaction has come to mean QCD.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo-nucleon systems such as the deuteron, the nucleus of a deuterium atom, as well as protonÿproton or neutronÿproton scattering are ideal for studying the NN force. Such systems can be described by attributing a potential (such as the Yukawa potential) to the nucleons and using the potentials in a Schr?dinger equation. The form of the potential is derived phenomenologically (by measurement), although for the long-range interaction, meson-exchange theories help to construct the potential. The parameters of the potential are determined by fitting to experimental data such as the deuteron binding energy or NN elastic scattering cross sections (or, equivalently in this context, so-called NN phase shifts).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most widely used NN potentials are the Paris potential, the Argonne AV18 potential\\r\\n,[16] the CD-Bonn potential and the Nijmegen potentials.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more recent approach is to develop effective field theories for a consistent description of nucleonÿnucleon and three-nucleon forces. Quantum hadrodynamics is an effective field theory of the nuclear force, comparable to QCD for color interactions and QED for electromagnetic interactions. Additionally, chiral symmetry breaking can be analyzed in terms of an effective field theory (called chiral perturbation theory) which allows perturbative calculations of the interactions between nucleons with pions as exchange particles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ultimate goal of nuclear physics would be to describe all nuclear interactions from the basic interactions between nucleons. This is called the microscopic or ab initio approach of nuclear physics. There are two major obstacles to overcome before this dream can become reality:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an active area of research with ongoing advances in computational techniques leading to better first-principles calculations of the nuclear shell structure. Two- and three-nucleon potentials have been implemented for nuclides up to A?=?12.\\r\\n\\r\\nA successful way of describing nuclear interactions is to construct one potential for the whole nucleus instead of considering all its nucleon components. This is called the macroscopic approach. For example, scattering of neutrons from nuclei can be described by considering a plane wave in the potential of the nucleus, which comprises a real part and an imaginary part. This model is often called the optical model since it resembles the case of light scattered by an opaque glass sphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nNuclear potentials can be local or global: local potentials are limited to a narrow energy range and/or a narrow nuclear mass range, while global potentials, which have more parameters and are usually less accurate, are functions of the energy and the nuclear mass and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications.","input":"What is the origin of the strong nuclear force?"},{"output":"about 1480","context":"Woodblock printing is a technique for printing text, images or patterns used widely throughout East Asia and originating in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 AD, and woodblock printing remained the most common East Asian method of printing books and other texts, as well as images, until the 19th century. Ukiyo-e is the best known type of Japanese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique for printing images on paper are covered by the art term woodcut, except for the block-books produced mainly in the 15th century in India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the invention of woodblock printing, seals and stamps were used for making impressions. The oldest of these seals came from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The use of round \\"cylinder seals\\" for rolling an impress onto clay tablets goes back to early Mesopotamian civilization before 3000 BC, where they are the most common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. A few much larger brick (e.g. 13G13?cm) stamps for marking clay bricks survive from Akkad from around 2270 BC.[1] There are also Roman lead pipe inscriptions of some length that were stamped, and amulet MS 5236 may be a unique surviving gold foil sheet stamped with an amulet text in the 6th?century BC. However none of these used ink, which is necessary for printing (on a proper definition), but stamped marks into relatively soft materials. In both China and Egypt, the use of small stamps for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In Europe and India, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus; this was probably also the case in China. The process is essentially the samein Europe special presentation impressions of prints were often printed on silk until at least the 17th century.\\r\\nThe wood block is carefully prepared as a relief pattern, which means the areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife, chisel, or sandpaper leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block was cut along the grain of the wood. It is necessary only to ink the block and bring it into firm and even contact with the paper or cloth to achieve an acceptable print. The content would of course print \\"in reverse\\" or mirror-image, a further complication when text was involved. The art of carving the woodcut is technically known as xylography, though the term is rarely used in English.\\r\\nFor colour printing, multiple blocks are used, each for one colour, although overprinting two colours may produce further colours on the print. Multiple colours can be printed by keying the paper to a frame around the woodblocks.\\r\\nThere are three methods of printing to consider:\\r\\nIn addition, jia xie is a method for dyeing textiles (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th-6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.[3]\\r\\nThe earliest woodblock printing known is in colourChinese silk from the Han Dynasty printed in three colours.[3] On paper, European woodcut prints with coloured blocks were invented in Germany in 1508 and are known as chiaroscuro woodcuts.\\r\\nColour is very common in Asian woodblock printing on paper; in China the first known example is a Diamond sutra of 1341, printed in black and red at the Zifu Temple in modern-day Hubei province. The earliest dated book printed in more than 2 colours is Chengshi moyuan (Chinese: O), a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606 and the technique reached its height in books on art published in the first half of the 17th century. Notable examples are the Hu Zhengyan's Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio of 1633,[4] and the Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual published in 1679 and 1701.[5]\\r\\nIn Japan, a multi-colour technique, called nishiki-e (\\"brocade pictures\\"), spread more widely, and was used for prints, from the 1760s on. Japanese woodcut became a major artistic form, although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting.\\r\\nIn both Europe and Japan, book illustrations were normally printed in black ink only, and colour reserved for individual artistic prints. In China, the reverse was true, and colour printing was used mainly in books on art and erotica.\\r\\nThe earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from China and are of silk, printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before AD 220).[3] It is clear that woodblock printing developed in Asia several centuries before Europe. The Chinese were the first to use the process to print solid text, and equally that, much later, in Europe the printing of images on cloth developed into the printing of images on paper (woodcuts). It is also now established that the use in Europe of the same process to print substantial amounts of text together with images in block-books only came after the development of movable type, which was developed by Bi Sheng (990ÿ1051) during the Northern Song Dynasty of China, about four hundred years later.\\r\\nIn China, an alternative to woodblock printing was a system of reprography since the Han Dynasty using carved stone steles to reproduce pages of text.[6] The three necessary components for woodblock printing are the wood block, which carries the design cut in relief; dye or ink, which had been widely used in the ancient world; and either cloth or paper, which was first developed in China, around the 3rd century BC or 2nd century BC. Woodblock printing on papyrus seems never to have been practised, although it would be possible.\\r\\nA few specimen of wood block printing, possibly called tarsh in Arabic, have been excavated from a 10th-century context in Arabic Egypt. They were mostly used for prayers and amulets. The technique may be spread from China or an independent invention, but had very little impact and virtually disappeared at the end of the 14th century.[7] In India the main importance of the technique has always been as a method of printing textiles, which has been a large industry since at least the 10th century.[8] Large quantities of printed Indian silk and cotton were exported to Europe throughout the Modern Period.\\r\\nBecause Chinese has a character set running into the thousands, woodblock printing suits it better than movable type to the extent that characters only need to be created as they occur in the text. Although the Chinese had invented a form of movable type with baked clay in the 11th century, and metal movable type was invented in Korea in the 13th century,[9] woodblocks continued to be preferred owing to the formidable challenges of typesetting Chinese text with its 40,000 or more characters. Also, the objective of printing in the East may have been more focused on standardization of ritual text (such as the Buddhist canon Tripitaka, requiring 80,000 woodblocks), and the purity of validated woodblocks could be maintained for centuries.[10] When there was a need for the reproduction of a text, the original block could simply be brought out again, while moveable type necessitated error-prone composition of distinct \\"editions\\".\\r\\nIn China, Korea, and Japan, the state involved itself in printing at a relatively early stage; initially only the government had the resources to finance the carving of the blocks for long works. The difference between East Asian woodblock printing and the Western printing press had major implications for the development of book culture and book markets in East Asia and Europe.\\r\\nWoodblock printing in China is strongly associated with Buddhism, which encouraged the spread of charms and sutras. In the Tang Dynasty, a Chinese writer named Fenzhi first mentioned in his book \\"Yuan Xian San Ji\\" that the woodblock was used to print Buddhist scriptures during the Zhenguan years (AD 627~649).\\r\\nThe oldest existing print done with wood-blocks was discovered in 1974 in an excavation in Xi'an (the capital of Tang-Dynasty China, then called Chang'an), Shaanxi, China, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them.[11] It is a dharani sutra printed on hemp paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the Tang Dynasty (618ÿ907).[11] Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang Dynasty has also been found, the Saddharma pundarika sutra printed from 690 to 699.[11]\\r\\nAn early example of woodblock printing on paper is The Great Dharani Sutra that is dated between AD 704 and 751. It was found at Bulguksa, South Korea in 1966.[12] Its Buddhist text was printed on a 8?cm G?630?cm (3.1?in G?248.0?in) mulberry paper scroll in the early Korean Kingdom of Unified Silla. Another version of the Dharani sutra, printed in Japan around AD 770, is also frequently cited as an example of early printing. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by Empress Shtoku. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the Hyakumant Darani (ЄĈmߛpz, \\"1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani\\").\\r\\nThe world's earliest dated (AD 868) printed book is a Chinese scroll about sixteen feet long containing the text of the Diamond Sutra. It was found in 1907 by the archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein in the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, and is currently in the possession of the British Museum. The book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing. The colophon, at the inner end, reads: Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ].\\r\\nIn late 10th century China the complete Buddhist canon Tripitaka of 130,000 pages was printed with blocks, which took between 1080 and 1102, and many other very long works were printed. Early books were on scrolls, but other book formats were developed. First came the Jingzhe zhuang or \\"sutra binding\\", a scroll folded concertina-wise, which avoided the need to unroll half a scroll to see a passage in the middle. About AD 1000 \\"butterfly binding\\" was developed; two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a codex with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the bindings were sewn rather than pasted.[14] Only relatively small volumes (juan ) were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a tao, with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 juan in 595 tao.[15]\\r\\nThe earliest known woodblock printing dates from 764-770, when Empress Shotoku commissioned one million small wooden pagodas containing short printed scrollstypically 6?cm G?45?cm (2.4?in G?17.7?in)to be distributed to temples.[16] Apart from the production of Buddhist texts, which became widespread from the 11th century in Japan, the process was only adopted in Japan for secular books surprisingly late, and a Chinese-Japanese dictionary of 1590 is the earliest known example.\\r\\nThough the Jesuits operated a movable type printing-press in Nagasaki, printing equipment[17] which Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army seized from Korea in 1593[18] had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, Tokugawa Ieyasu, even before becoming shogun, effected the creation of the first native movable type,[17] using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.\\r\\nAn edition of the Confucian Analects was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of Emperor Go-Yzei. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the running script style of Japanese writing would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.[19]\\r\\nThe technology quickly gained popularity among publishers, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. As a result, Japan began to see something of literary mass production and increasing literacy. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, kibyshi (satirical novels), sharebon (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the jruri (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the jruri theatre scripts, a particular style of writing would come to be the standard for that genre; in other words, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.\\r\\nThe technique is found through South and Central Asia, and in the Byzantine world for cloth, and by AD 1000 examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in Islamic Egypt. Printing onto cloth had spread much earlier, and was common in Europe by 1300. \\"In the 13th century the Chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to Europe,\\"[20] soon after paper became available in Europe. The print in woodcut, later joined by engraving, quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as playing cards and other uses.[2]\\r\\nMany early Chinese examples, such as the Diamond Sutra (above) contain images, mostly Buddhist, that are often elaborate. Later, some notable artists designed woodblock images for books, but the separate artistic print did not develop in China as it did in Europe and Japan. Apart from devotional images, mainly Buddhist, few \\"single-leaf\\" Chinese prints were made until the 19th century.\\r\\nBlock-books, where both text and images are cut on a single block for a whole page, appeared in Europe in the mid-15th century. As they were almost always undated and without statement of printer or place of printing, determining their dates of printing has been an extremely difficult task. Allan H. Stevenson, by comparing the watermarks in the paper used in blockbooks with watermarks in dated documents, concluded that the \\"heyday\\" of blockbooks was the 1460s, but that at least one dated from about 1451.[21][22] Block books printed in the 1470s were often of cheaper quality, as a cheaper alternative to books printed by printing press.[23] Block books continued to be printed sporadically up through the end of the 15th century.[21]\\r\\nThe most famous block-books are the Speculum Humanae Salvationis and the Ars moriendi, though in this the images and text are on different pages, but all block-cut. The Biblia pauperum, a Biblical picture-book, was the next most common title, and the great majority of block-books were popular devotional works. All block-books are fairly short at less than fifty pages. While in Europe movable metal type soon became cheap enough to replace woodblock printing for the reproduction of text, woodcuts remained a major way to reproduce images in illustrated works of early modern European printing. (See also: Old master print.)\\r\\nMost block-books before about 1480 were printed on only one side of the paper? if they were printed by rubbing it would be difficult to print on both sides without damaging the first one to be printed. Many were printed with two pages per sheet, producing a book with opening of two printed pages, followed by openings with two blank pages (as earlier in China). The blank pages were then glued together to produce a book looking like a type-printed one. Where both sides of a sheet have been printed, it is presumed a printing-press was used.\\r\\nThe method was also used extensively for printing playing cards.[24]\\r\\nIn East Asia, woodblock printing proved to be more enduring than in Europe, continuing well into the 19th century as the major form of printing texts, especially in China, even after the introduction of the European printing press.\\r\\nIn countries using Arabic, Turkish and similar scripts, works, especially the Qur'an were sometimes printed by lithography in the 19th century,[25] as the links between the characters require compromises when movable type is used which were considered inappropriate for sacred texts.[citation needed]\\r\\nNianhua were a form of coloured woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the Chinese New Year.\\r\\nDr. Henry, in his \\"Notes on the Economic Botany of China,\\" refers to your wish to obtain specimens of the woods used in China for printing blocks.\\r\\nThe name which the neighbouring city of Wuchang enjoys for the excellence of its printing work has led me to inquire into the woods used there, and I am sending you specimens of them by parcel post.\\r\\nThe wood which is considered the best is the Veng li mu, which has been identified as the Pyrus betulcefolia, Bunge., and which grows in this Province.

From this it would appear to be a slow growing tree.\\r\\nW. R. Carles, Esq., to Royal Gardens, Kew, dated Her Majesty's Consulate, Hankow, July 25, 1896.[26]\\r\\nBlock printing has also been extensively used for decorative purposes such as fabrics, leathers and wallpaper. This is easiest with repetitive patterns composed of one or a small number of motifs that are small to medium in size (due to the difficulty of carving and handling larger blocks).[27] For a multi-colour pattern, each colour element is carved as a separate block and individually inked and applied. Block printing was the standard method of producing wallpaper until the early 20th century, and is still used by a few traditionalist firms.

It is located in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. Sriharikota Range was renamed in 2002 after ISRO's former chairman Satish Dhawan.\\r\\nSDSC's current director is P. Kunhikrishnan. He took over from M. Y. S. Prasad on 1 June 2015 after the latter retired from service.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSriharikota island was chosen in 1969 for a satellite launching station. The centre became operational in 1971 when an RH-125 sounding rocket was launched.[3] The first attempted launch of an orbital satellite, Rohini 1A aboard a Satellite Launch Vehicle, took place on 10 Aug 1979, but due to a failure in thrust vectoring of the rocket's second stage, the satellite's orbit decayed on 19 Aug 1979.[4] SHAR was named as 'Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR' (SDSC), on 5 September 2002, in memory of Satish Dhawan, former Chairman of the ISRO.\\r\\nThe SHAR facility now consists of two launch pads, with the second built in 2005. The second launch pad was used for launches beginning in 2005 and is a universal launch pad, accommodating all of the launch vehicles used by ISRO. The two launch pads will allow multiple launches in a single year, which was not possible earlier. India's lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched from the centre at 6:22?AM IST on 22 October 2008. India's first Mars orbiter Mangalyaan was launched from the centre on November 5, 2013, which was successfully placed into Mars orbit on 24 Sep 2014.\\r\\nSHAR will be the main base for the Indian human spaceflight program. A new third launchpad will be built specifically to meet the target of launching a manned space mission.[5]\\r\\nSatish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) is located in Sriharikota, a spindle-shaped barrier island on the east coast of Andhra Pradesh. Features like a good launch azimuth corridor for various missions, nearness to the equator (benefiting eastward launches), and large uninhabited area for a safety zone make it an ideal spaceport.\\r\\nSHAR covers a total area of about 145?km2 (56?sq?mi) with a coastal length of 27?km (17?mi). Prior to its acquisition for ISRO by the Indian Government, it was a firewood plantation of Eucalyptus and Casuarina trees. This island is affected by both south-westerly and north-easterly monsoons, but heavy rains come only in October and November. Thus many clear days are available for out-door static tests and launchings.[6]\\r\\nSHAR is linked to Sullurupeta by a road across Pulicat Lake. Sullurupeta has connectivity with other parts of India by Indian Railways and is on a National Highway 5 (India) that connects it to Chennai (about 83?km (52?mi) south) and Kolkata.\\r\\nOriginally known as the Sriharikota Range (SHAR)[1] and later named after Satish Dhawan, it is India's primary orbital launch site to this day. The first flight-test of 'Rohini-125', a small sounding rocket which took place on 9 October 1971 was the first ever spaceflight from SHAR. Since then technical, logistic and administrative infrastructure have been enhanced. Together with the northerly Balasore Rocket Launching Station, the facilities are operated under the ISRO Range Complex (IREX) headquartered at SHAR.[7]\\r\\nThe range became operational when three Rohini 125 sounding rockets were launched on 9 and 10 October 1971. Previously, India used Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS), at Thiruvananthapuram, on the south-western coast of India, to launch sounding rockets. The first test launch of the complete SLV-3 rocket occurred in August 1979 but it was only partially successful following a malfunction in the second-stage guidance system. SHAR facilities worked satisfactorily during the SLV-3 preparation and launch. On 18 July 1980 the SLV-3 successfully launched India's third satellite. Out of the four SLV launches from SHAR, two were successful.\\r\\nThe ASLV orbital launcher was integrated vertically, beginning with motor and subassembly preparations in the Vehicle Integration Building (VIB) and completed on the pad within the 40?m tall Mobile Service Structure. The first ASLV launch from SHAR took place in 1987 and resulted in a failure. Eventually, out the four ASLV launches from 1987ÿ94, only one was successful.\\r\\nThe PSLV launch complex was commissioned during 1990. It has a 3,000?tonne, 76.5?m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room. The solid propellant motors for the PSLV are processed by SHAR, which also carries out launch operations. The first launch of the PSLV took place on 20 September 1993.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Centre has two operational orbital launch pads. SHAR is ISRO's satellite launching base and additionally provides launch facilities for the full range of Rohini sounding rockets. The Vehicle Assembly, Static Test and Evaluation Complex (VAST, previously STEX) and the Solid Propellant Space Booster Plant (SPROB) are located at SHAR for casting and testing solid motors. The site also has a Telemetry Tracking & Control centre, Liquid Propellant Storage and Servicing Facilities (LSSF), the Management Service Group and Sriharikota Common Facilities. The PSLV launch complex was commissioned in 1990. It has a 3,000?tonne, 76.5?m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room.[8]\\r\\nThe solid propellant space booster plant (SPROB) processes large size propellant grains for the satellite launch vehicles. The Static Test & Evaluation Complex (STEX) tests and qualifies different types of solid motor for launch vehicles. The control centre at SHAR houses computers and data processing, closed circuit television, real-time tracking systems and meteorological observation equipment. It is linked to eight radars located at Sriharikota and the five stations of ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking & Command Network (ISTRAC).\\r\\nThe propellant production plant produces composite solid propellant for rocket motors of ISRO using ammonium perchlorate (oxidiser), fine aluminium powder (fuel) and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (binder). The solid motors processed here include those for the first-stage booster motor of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)  a five segmented motor of 2.8?m diameter and 22?m length, weighing 160?tons with a thrust level of 450?tons.\\r\\nRocket motors and their subsystems have to be rigorously tested and evaluated on ground before they are declared flight worthy. The facilities at SDSC SHAR are used for testing solid rocket motors, both at ambient conditions and simulated high altitude conditions. Besides these, there are facilities for conducting Vibration, Shock, Constant Acceleration and Thermal/humidity tests.\\r\\nSDSC SHAR has infrastructure for launching satellites into low earth orbit, polar orbit and geo-stationary transfer orbit. The launch complexes provide support for vehicle assembly, fuelling, checkout and launch operations. The Centre also has facilities for launching sounding rockets for atmospheric studies. The mobile service tower, launch pad, preparation facilities for different launch stages & spacecraft, storage, transfer and servicing facilities for liquid propellants, etc., are the principal parts of the PSLV/GSLV launch complex.\\r\\nFor supporting the GSLV Mk III programme additional facilities were set up at SDSC. A new plant (SPP) is set up to process heavier class boosters with 200?tonnes of Solid propellant. The static test complex is being augmented for qualifying the S-200 booster. Other new facilities include a Solid Stage Assembly Building, Satellite Preparation and Filling Facility and Hardware Storage buildings. The existing liquid propellant and cryogenic propellant storage and filling systems, Propellant Servicing Facilities will also be augmented. The range instrumentation system will be enhanced further\\r\\nThis launch pad was used by the Satellite Launch Vehicle and Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle is located at the southern tip of the current launch site. It has been decommissioned. Initially it was built for launching SLV-3 but was later augmented to be used as an ASLV launch complex.\\r\\nThe modern First Launch Pad was built in the early 1990s for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. It has also been used by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. The First Launch Pad is undergoing major expansion with PIF (PSLV Integration Facilities) project worth 475 crores. Once complete, the First Launch Pad is expected to cater to around 15 launches per year. [9]\\r\\nSecond Launch Complex became operational in 2005[10] and unlike First Launch Pad operates on philosophy of Integrate Transfer & Launch[11]. SLP is configured as a universal launch pad capable of accommodating PSLV, GSLV and GSLV Mk III launch vehicles of ISRO. In addition to the Vehicle Assembly building (VAB), a Solid Stage Assembly Building (SSAB) was constructed for assembly of S200 strapons of GSLV Mk III. Augmented SSAB can now assemble first stages of PSLV and GSLV with VAB holding another rocket in parallel. A new Second Vehicle Assembly Building (SVAB) in the same complex is being constructed with a budgetary grant of 630 crores and is expected to be ready in mid 2018. [12]\\r\\nA Third Launch Pad is planned at a cost of Rs?6?billion and would be capable of supporting crewed missions as well.[13]","input":"Where is the satish dhawan space centre located?"},{"output":"29 times","context":"Venus Williams and Serena Williams (born June 17, 1980, and September 26, 1981, respectively) are professional tennis players and sisters who have faced off 29 times in professional tournaments, most recently in the 2018 Indian Wells Masters 1000 event.

They have won 22 titles when playing doubles together, including 14 Grand Slam titles and 3 Olympic gold medals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSerena and Venus Williams played their first professional match against each other in the second round of the 1998 Australian Open.[2] Venus won 7ÿ6(4), 6ÿ1. The match was described as \\"subpar\\".[3] They played again in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open, the first clay court tournament of Serena's career,[4] which Venus won 6ÿ4, 6ÿ2. Together they won two doubles titles.\\r\\nTheir next match was almost a year later in the final of the 1999 Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida. Serena was coming off her first two tournament titles,[5] but Venus won the match 6ÿ1, 4ÿ6, 6ÿ4. The match was the first singles final between sisters on the WTA tour[6] and was described by their father as a \\"bullfight\\".[7] Serena won her first professional singles match against Venus later that year in the final of the Grand Slam Cup. Serena was coming off her first Grand Slam championship at the US Open and defeated her elder sister, and defending champion, 6ÿ1, 3ÿ6, 6ÿ3. Venus was the only top player up to this point that Serena had not yet defeated.[8] Together, they won three doubles titles, two of them being majors; French Open & U.S Open.\\r\\nEntering their next match in the semifinals of Wimbledon in 2000 (their first match against each other on grass), Serena was the favorite.[9] However, the victory went to Venus 6ÿ2, 7ÿ6(3), who would go on to win the Wimbledon trophy for her first Grand Slam singles title. They teamed up to win the Wimbledon doubles title and later the Olympic gold medal. Venus's career advantage now stood at 4ÿ1.\\r\\nThey started out the year by winning the Australian Open doubles title.\\r\\nIn the spring at the Tennis Masters Series in Indian Wells, California, amid controversy Venus withdrew before her scheduled semifinal match against Serena. The Williams family was accused of match-fixing, but the accusation was dismissed by most, including Andre Agassi who called it \\"ridiculous\\".[10] Serena won the final against Kim Clijsters amid boos, during both the match and the subsequent trophy presentation.[11]\\r\\nThe only match between the Williams sisters during 2001 occurred in the final of the US Open, where they had never met but where both had previously won singles titles. This was the first final involving sisters at a Grand Slam tournament during the open era and the first since the Watson sisters played in the 1884 Wimbledon final. This match has been described as arguably \\"the most-anticipated tennis final in years\\".[12] However, nerves seem to have played a factor in the match, which was won easily by Venus 6ÿ2, 6ÿ4.[12] Noted journalist Peter Bodo has said that this first Grand Slam final played between the Williams sisters was \\"really a pretty lousy match,... even though it was a great performance by the winner.\\"[13] With the victory, Venus now led their rivalry 5ÿ1 and in Grand Slam singles titles 4ÿ1.\\r\\nVenus and Serena would play each other four times in 2002. In addition to being the most times they had met in a single year, this would also mark the first time that Serena would end the season with a leading head-to-head, 4ÿ0.\\r\\nTheir first meeting of the year occurred in the semifinals at the NASDAQ-100 Open. Serena won the match 6ÿ2, 6ÿ2, only the second victory over her sister in her career and the first since 1999. Venus's loss was described as \\"listless\\" and it ended her streak of 22 consecutive matches and three consecutive titles at the event.[14]\\r\\nTheir next meeting was their second in a Grand Slam final, but their first on clay courts. At Roland Garros Serena beat Venus in a \\"tight\\" match 7ÿ5, 6ÿ3. The Grand Slam was the first for Serena in three years, and it was the first final at the French Open ever played by sisters. By reaching the final, Venus and Serena assured themselves of moving up to first and second in the world rankings, respectively.[15]\\r\\nOne month later, the Williams sisters again met in a Grand Slam final, at Wimbledon. Again, Serena was the victor 7ÿ6(4), 6ÿ3 and the win moved Serena past her sister to the top of the rankings. Venus still led 5ÿ4 in their head-to-head and 4ÿ3 in Grand Slams, but it was now Serena who was seen as the player \\"now setting the agenda for women's tennis\\".[16] They won the doubles title together.\\r\\nTheir fourth and last match of the year occurred in the final at the US Open, in a match where the victor would take not only the trophy but the No.1 ranking as well. Serena won the match 6ÿ4, 6ÿ3 with a \\"blistering\\" display of tennis.[17]\\r\\n2003 would be a year of injuries and loss for Venus and Serena Williams, with the two highlights being the Australian Open and Wimbledon finals.\\r\\nThe first match of 2003 contested between the Williams sisters was the first final between the two players at the Australian Open but the fourth consecutive at the majors. Serena won the match 7ÿ6(4), 3ÿ6, 6ÿ4, the closest contested match between them since 1999. The win completed what has become popularly known as the \\"Serena Slam\\"; Serena Williams became the first player since Steffi Graf to hold all four Grand Slams at the same time. In addition Venus Williams became the first player since Martina Hingis in 1997 to make four consecutive Grand Slam finals, and the sisters together became the first players in the open era to contest four consecutive finals at the majors. Together they won the doubles title.\\r\\nThis consistent play at recent Grand Slams led some to remark that the Williams sisters had a stranglehold on women's tennis.[18]\\r\\nThe Williams sisters next met in the 2003 Wimbledon final, a repeat of the 2002 final in the same tournament. Again the match was close but Serena, aided by an abdominal injury that negatively impacted Venus's speed, won 4ÿ6, 6ÿ4, 6ÿ2. The win was the second consecutive at Wimbledon for Serena and her fifth out the last six.[19] Additionally, the Williams sisters collectively had now won the last four Wimbledon titles and seven of the last nine Grand Slams. Serena Williams had now won their last six consecutive meetings, and led the head-to-head 7ÿ5.\\r\\nThe Wimbledon final was the last Grand Slam final contested between the two for five years. Both sisters would be knocked off the tour by injuries, and then have to contend with the death of Yetunde Price, their half sister.[20]\\r\\nVenus and Serena Williams did not meet in a professional tennis match during 2004, a year which saw neither sister win a Grand Slam for the first time since 1998. 2005 would be a return to Grand Slam victory for both of the Williams sisters, but in perhaps a sign of the increased competition neither of their championships were decided against each other.\\r\\nTheir first match of 2005 was in the quarterfinals of the NASDAQ-100 Open, their third career meeting at the tournament. The match was won by Venus Williams 6ÿ1, 7ÿ6(8); it was the first meeting outside of a final between the two in three years and was the first win by the elder Williams sister in four years.[21]\\r\\nThe Williams sisters next met on one of the largest stages in tennis, the US Open, though much earlier in the tournament than they were accustomed to. Venus, as the recent Wimbledon champion and after three \\"magnificent efforts\\" to reach this round was perhaps favored in a Williams head-to-head for the first time in a few years .[22] In the fourth round (their earliest meeting in a Grand Slam since their very first at the 1998 Australian Open) Venus Williams won 7ÿ6(5), 6ÿ2. Venus would lose in the quarterfinals 4ÿ6 7ÿ5 6ÿ1 to eventual champion Kim Clijsters, the first time since the 1998 Rome meeting that the winner of a Williams sisters match-up did not win the title.[21]\\r\\nAt the close of the year, after the first year since 2000 in which Serena was unable to win a match against her older sister, Venus Williams had now tied the head-to-head 7ÿ7.\\r\\nThe first meeting in 2008 between the sisters occurred at the Canara Bank Bangalore Open, their first meeting in a Tier II event. The only match between the sisters to end in a third-set tiebreak, both Venus and Serena were, according to commentator and former player Tracy Austin \\"busting a gut to win\\". The match end in a 6ÿ3, 3ÿ6, 7ÿ6(4) victory for Serena.\\r\\nVenus and Serena next met on a familiar stage, Wimbledon; the match was their fourth meeting on the grass courts and their third final. The match featured \\"big hitting and big serving\\" as well as \\"some wonderful defense and court coverage\\". Testament to the fact that this was arguably the best Williams sisters match to date, former player and commentator John McEnroe has called the match \\"borderline classic\\".[23] Venus won the match 7ÿ5, 6ÿ4. They teamed up to win the doubles title and later a second Olympic Gold Medal together.\\r\\nAt the US Open, fourth seeded Serena defeated seventh seeded Venus in the quarterfinals 7ÿ6(6), 7ÿ6(7) and eventually won the tournament. Tennis Magazine proclaimed the match the best women's singles match of 2008. The final match-up of the year between the Williams sisters was during the round robin phase of the year-ending Sony Ericsson Championships, with Venus winning 5ÿ7, 6ÿ1, 6ÿ0. This was the first 6ÿ0 set in their matchups.\\r\\nAt the end of 2008, their career head-to-head record was tied 9ÿ9.\\r\\nThe Williams' first match of year 2009 was at the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships, where they met in the semifinals. In a match that was described as a \\"thriller\\" by CNN, Venus prevailed 6ÿ1, 2ÿ6, 7ÿ6(3). Serena was dogged by a knee injury in the third set, but did not excuse herself because of this, and Venus said that the match had been worthy of a final.[24] Simon Reed, writing for Eurosport, said that the rivalry had become \\"greater now than it ever has been\\" in the previous three or four matches, due to the increased emotional intensity that the matches appeared to stir up in the players, which he believed had been lacking in the earlier part of their careers.[25] Venus and Serena next played in the semifinals of the Sony Ericsson Open in April. Serena won the match 6ÿ4, 3ÿ6, 6ÿ3, temporarily secured her World No. 1 ranking, and tied their head-to-head record at ten wins apiece.[26] The two reached the final of the 2009 Wimbledon Championships for both singles and doubles. Serena won the singles title for the first time in six years, beating Venus 7ÿ6(3), 6ÿ2. They met for the fourth time in the year during the round robin phase of the year-ending 2009 Sony Ericsson Championships, with Serena winning 5ÿ7, 6ÿ4, 7ÿ6(4) saving match point. They met again in the final of the tournament with Serena winning again by a score of 6ÿ2, 7ÿ6(4). The head-to-head now stood at 13ÿ10 in favor of Serena, who has also won the last four meetings.\\r\\nDue to a mixture of injury and illness the pair did not face each other again until the 2013 Family Circle Cup. It was their first matchup on clay since the 2002 French Open final. Serena won her fifth consecutive match against Venus. Venus and Serena's 25th encounter came in the semi-finals of the 2014 Rogers Cup. Serena went into the match with a five consecutive match winning streak against her older sister. However, Venus won the match 6(2)-7, 6ÿ2, 6ÿ3, making the sisters' head to head record at 14ÿ11 in favor of Serena. Venus increased her Premier Mandatory/Premier 5 record against Serena to 5ÿ2 and her semi-final record against her sister to 3ÿ4.\\r\\nAfter a period of six years, the pair met in the fourth round of Wimbledon in 2015 - their first meeting in a grand slam event since Wimbledon 2009. It was the pair's sixth meeting at Wimbledon. Serena won the match by a score of 6ÿ4, 6ÿ3, making the sisters' head to head record 15ÿ11 in Serena's favor and 4ÿ2 in Wimbledon again in favor of Serena.[27] They met again in the quarterfinals of the US Open, where Serena won, taking the head to head to 16ÿ11 in her favor.\\r\\nThe sisters renewed their grand slam rivalry in the Australian Open final. Serena won her seventh Australian Open title, and 23rd Grand Slam title overall, defeating Venus 6ÿ4, 6ÿ4. The win also allowed Serena to pass Steffi Graf's 22 grand slam singles titles.\\r\\nThis section analyzes the rivalry in regards to their professional and personal relationship, how their entwined careers and rivalry has affected their legacy, and the overall cultural impact of the rivalry.\\r\\nThe professional relationship and dynamic between Venus and Serena Williams is deeply affected by their close personal relationship. The notion of two top professionals emerging from the same family to compete against one another is unprecedented, and is a scenario which has been described as being \\"as improbable as one set of parents raising Picasso and Monet.\\"[28] After Serena's big wins over Venus' only finals at the 2003 Australian Open and the 2002 French Open, journalists said \\"Clearly Venus has a 'big sister complex' towards Serena\\". Peter Bodo, further speaking to the unlikeliness of siblings contesting Grand Slam finals, states \\"It's a common occurrence that will cease to be possible, perhaps ever again, the moment they set the sticks aside.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe all-Williams final at the 2001 US Open drew a larger television audience than the Notre Dame-Nebraska college football game being broadcast at the same time.[30] In fact, part of the reason that the women's final at the US Open was moved to its \\"prime time\\" spot was because of the positive effect that the Williams sisters had on television ratings.[31] CBS's four highest-rated US Open women's finals of the last decade all involved the Williams sisters.[32]\\r\\nThe Williams legacy can also arguably be seen in the increased representation of African Americans among tennis professionals and new players, though their representation among professionals still remains small.[33][34] A third of all new players at the grass-roots level are either African American or Hispanic, a fact to which the USTA's president Jane Brown Grimes says, \\"I can't help but think that Venus and Serena are drivers behind that\\".[32]\\r\\nWTA, Grand Slam, and Grand Slam Cup main draw results included.","input":"How many times have the williams sisters played each other?"},{"output":"Enos Stanley Kroenke","context":"Enos Stanley Kroenke (/?kro??ki/; born July 29, 1947) is an American business entrepreneur.

Thus, he was nearing the maximum 29.99% threshold, beyond which he would be forced to make an offer for all remaining shares.[17]\\r\\nOn April 10, 2011, it was reported that Kroenke was in advanced talks to complete the takeover of Arsenal.[18][19] The following day, it was announced that he increased his shareholding in Arsenal to 62.89% by purchasing the stakes of Danny Fiszman and Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith, and agreed to make an offer for the rest of the club at S11,750 per share, valuing the club at S731M.[20][21]\\r\\nIn late 2017, the company developed a new esports team franchise in the newly founded Overwatch League, named the Los Angeles Gladiators, that will begin their inaugural season later that year on December 6.[22][23]\\r\\nOn April 13, 1995, Stan Kroenke helped Georgia Frontiere move the Los Angeles Rams from Anaheim to St. Louis by purchasing a 30% share of the team.[24]\\r\\nIn April 2010, as he was trying to gain full ownership of the team, and knowing of an escape clause in the Rams lease at the Edward Jones Dome, Stan Kroenke said: \\"I'm going to attempt to do everything that I can to keep the Rams in St. Louis. \\"[25]\\r\\nIn February 2013, the Rams and the City of St. Louis went to arbitration over a clause in the Rams lease that stated the Rams current stadium must be in the top tier of NFL Stadiums. The arbitrators agreed with the Rams, giving the Rams the ability to break their original lease and go to a year to year lease agreement.[26]\\r\\nShowing that he was willing to work with Missouri officials and to give the governor a \\"complete understanding\\" of the stadium situation, on November 30, 2015, Stan Kroenke met with Missouri Governor Jay Nixon at Rams Park in Earth City, Missouri.[27]\\r\\nOn January 5, 2015, it was announced that the Kroenke Group was teaming up with Stockbridge Capital Group to build a 70,000 seat NFL stadium and venue in Inglewood, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, threatening the Rams' future in St. Louis. In response, St. Louis countered with National Car Rental Field, a proposed open-air stadium in the north riverfront in downtown St. Louis with the hope of the Rams staying in St. Louis.[28] At the NFL relocation presentation that St. Louis was no longer a viable market for the NFL and was best served with only two teams. Kroenke also questioned the financial future of the team.[29] NFL commissioner Roger Goodell also stated that St. Louis funding did not meet the criteria set by the NFL.[30] St. Louis officials countered that Kroneke was misrepresenting the city and defended that St. Louis was being misrepresented at the owners meeting.[31]\\r\\nThe Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers are also unhappy with old stadiums (O.co Coliseum in Oakland and Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego respectively) lacking updated amenities and were proposing a stadium in Carson, California, another suburb of Los Angeles, in competition with Kroenke's Inglewood proposal. As of 2017, the Chargers have announced they will be moving to Los Angeles for the 2017 season. Playing games initially in Carson and then will move into Kroenke's Inglewood Stadium. The Raiders have announced a move to Las Vegas, Nevada.\\r\\nOn January 4, 2016, all three teams applied for relocation to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season.[32] The following day, the Rams and Stan Kroenke released their proposal for relocation. Some of the Rams' conclusions were disputed by the Mayor of St. Louis Francis Slay (in a letter to Roger Goodell),[33] the St. Louis Regional Chamber,[34] and Forbes.[35] However, some say that staying in St. Louis was ultimately a bad deal for the city and the city is better off with them leaving.[36]\\r\\nOn January 12, 2016, the NFL approved the Rams' application to relocate from St. Louis back to Los Angeles with a 30-2 vote and Kroenke was praised by other NFL owners afterwards.[37][38] On April 12, 2017 it was reported that the City of St. Louis, St. Louis County, and the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority filed a 52-page lawsuit against the NFL and all 32 NFL clubs as defendants (including Stan Kroenke) and seeks damages and restitution of profits.[39] On July 12, 2017, the Los Angeles Rams filed three motions seek to: dismiss the case for failure to state a claim, dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction, and appeal to have the case determined through arbitration rather than in front of a St. Louis based jury. The motions in the case will be decided upon by Judge Christopher McGraugh.[40]\\r\\nIn 2006, Kroenke, in partnership with the money manager Charles Banks, acquired the Napa Valley winery Screaming Eagle. (In April 2009, Banks said he was no longer involved with Screaming Eagle.)[41]\\r\\nKroenke is a major owner of working ranches, owning a total of 848,631 acres. The Land Report magazine ranked him as the United States' ninth-largest landowner in 2015.[42][43] Among notable purchases is his February 2016 acquisition of the famous Waggoner Ranch in Texas, the largest ranch within one fenceline.[44]\\r\\nIn August 2017, he came under fire for launching a new bloodsports television channel that was unveiled in the United Kingdom and will show regular hunting programmes that includes killing elephants, lions and other vulnerable African species.[45]","input":"Who owns the los angeles rams football team?"},{"output":"Emily \\"Cissy\\" Houston","context":"Emily \\"Cissy\\" Houston (ne Drinkard; born September 30, 1933)[3] is an American soul and gospel singer. After a successful career singing backup for such artists as Dionne Warwick, Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin, Houston embarked on a solo career, winning two Grammy Awards for her work. Houston is the mother of singer Whitney Houston, grandmother of Whitney's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, aunt of singers Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick, and a cousin of opera singer Leontyne Price.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn Emily Drinkard in Newark, New Jersey,[3] to Nitcholas and Delia Mae Drinkard (ne McCaskill), she was the eighth and final child; older siblings were brothers William (1918ÿ2003), Hansom (1924ÿdeceased), Nicky (1929ÿ1992), and Larry (1931ÿ2012); and sisters Lee (1920ÿ2005), mother of Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick, Marie (1922ÿ2007), and Anne (1927ÿ2003).[4]\\r\\nHouston's father Nitcholas Drinkard was born to Susan Bell (called Delia) Drinkard (ne Fuller), of Dutch and African-American descent.[5] His father John Drinkard, Jr., was of Native American descent.[5] The Drinkards had owned a substantial amount of farmland in Blakely, Georgia, at a time when it was unusual for black people to have large landholdings. The asset was gradually depleted as they sold small portions of land over time, to resolve the continued legal troubles of a close relative.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Houston's three oldest siblings were born, the family relocated to New Jersey during the Second Great Migration.[5] Her parents emphasized the children getting educated and being involved in the church, and her father encouraged Houston and her siblings to sing.[5] In 1938, five-year-old Cissy's mother Delia suffered a stroke and died of cerebral hemorrhage three years later.[6] Houston's father died of stomach cancer in 1951 when Houston was 18.[5][7] Cissy went to live with her older sister Lee and her husband Mancel Warrick.[8] The Warricks had three children: a son, Mancel Warrick Jr. and two daughters Marie Dionne a/k/a Dionne Warwick and Delia Mae a/k/a Dee Dee Warwick.[9] Renowned soprano Leontyne Price is a Drinkard cousin.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouston is a Christian, and has said that she \\"found Christ\\" at age 14.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, Houston married Freddie Garland and had a son, Gary Garland, an NBA basketball player and DePaul University Athletic Hall of Famer.[13][14][15] The Garlands divorced two years later.[14] In 1959, she married John Russell Houston, Jr., a Newark City administrator and entertainment executive.[14][16] The couple had a son, Michael Houston, who became a songwriter, and a daughter, Whitney Houston, who became a world-renowned Soul/R&B/pop singer.[17][18][19] Houston's second marriage also ended in divorce.[20] Aretha Franklin was an honorary aunt of Houston's daughter.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, Houston's daughter Whitney began to struggle with drug addiction. Houston staged several interventions to get her daughter into rehabilitation and recovery programs. On one occasion she obtained a court order and the assistance of two sheriffs to intervene, persuading her daughter to undertake treatment at Hope For Women Residential & Therapeutic Services in Atlanta, Georgia.[22] In her 2013 book, Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped, Cissy Houston described the scene she encountered at her daughters house in 2005 as follows: Somebody had spray-painted the walls and door with big glaring eyes and strange faces. Evil eyes, staring out like a threat... In another room there was a big framed photo of [Whitney Houston]  but someone had cut [her] head out. It was beyond disturbing, seeing my daughters face cut out like that. This visit led Cissy to return with law enforcement and perform an intervention.[23] Her daughter cycled through recovery, relapse and rehabilitation programs.[24] On February 11, 2012, Whitney Houston died at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles.[25] After her daughter's death, in an interview with the  New Jersey TV station WWOR, Houston expressed her distaste of the media's coverage of related events: \\"The media are awful. People have come from here and there, [and they] don't know what they're talking about,\\" she said. \\"People I haven't seen in 20 years  Here they come, [they] think they know everything, but that's not true. But God has his way of taking care of all of it, and I'm glad I know that. They really chopped on her, chopped on her  kept, kept, kept.\\" [26]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouston has six grandchildren (including the late Bobbi Kristina Brown), and nine great grandchildren.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouston's singing career began in 1938 when she joined her sister Anne and brothers Larry and Nicky in the gospel singing group the Drinkard Four.  Lee (who would later become the mother of singers Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick), later joined the group along with Ann Moss and Marie Epps, and the group was renamed The Drinkard Singers. Houston and the Drinkard Singers regularly performed at New Hope Baptist Church and later recorded a live album for RCA called A Joyful Noise.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, then about to give birth to daughter Whitney Houston, she formed the Sweet Inspirations with Doris Troy and niece Dee Dee Warwick. Later, under contract to Atlantic Records, Sylvia Shemwell, Estelle Brown and Myrna Smith form the line-up. During the mid-1960s, the Sweet Inspirations provided backup vocals for a variety of artists, including Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Lou Rawls, The Drifters, Dusty Springfield and Houston's niece Dionne Warwick. They appeared on Van Morrison's single Brown Eyed Girl. Houston performed the operatic soprano[not in citation given] melody on the Aretha Franklin hit, Ain't No Way.[28] In 1967, The Sweet Inspirations sang background vocals for The Jimi Hendrix Experience on the track \\"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, they were hired to sing backing vocals for Elvis Presley in Las Vegas on his return to live performances during July and August 1969. Presley often introduced them at shows by saying, \\"They really live up to their name ladies & gentleman, The Sweet Inspirations!\\" [30] Many of these performances can be heard on the All Shook Up and Live In Las Vegas live records.[30] Performing with Elvis Presley was Houston's final gig with The Sweet Inspirations. As her children were growing bigger, she decided to stop touring and focus on her career as a recording artist.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Cecily Blair she cut her first secular solo record \\"This Is My Vow\\" on MnM Records in 1963 following this up in 1966 with \\"Bring Him Back\\" b/w \\"World Of Broken Hearts\\" on Congress. Her final solo single before recording with The Sweet Inspirations was \\"Don't Come Running To Me\\" b/w \\"One Broken Heart For Sale\\" released on Kapp Records in 1967.[31] On these early singles her name is spelled as Sissie Houston. In 1969, Houston signed a recording contract with Commonwealth United Records and recorded her solo debut LP Presenting Cissy Houston which was released in 1970.[30]  It contained several well received singles, including covers of \\"I'll Be There\\" and \\"Be My Baby\\", both of which made the R&B charts.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the release of her debut album, Houston's contract was sold to Janus Records in 1970.[32] She recorded another album and several more singles in the early 1970s, which included the original recording of Jim Weatherly's \\"Midnight Train to Georgia\\" in 1972, later a number one hit for Gladys Knight & The Pips.[32][33] She continued to record with Janus Records until 1975.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, Houston was signed by Private Stock Records, working with arranger/producer Michael Zager on three albums. The second included her big disco hit \\"Think It Over\\", which climbed to No. 32 on the Billboard R&B chart in 1979. She represented USA at the World Popular Song Festival in 1979 with a track called \\"You're the Fire\\", landing second place and winning the \\"Most Outstanding Performance Award\\". This also appeared on her 1980 disco-flavored album, Step Aside for a Lady, again produced by Zager, but released on Columbia Records (on EMI in the United Kingdom).\\r\\n\\r\\nHouston's versatile cross-genre singing style has kept her highly in demand as a session musician with some of the world's most successful recording artists. Houston, along with Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick, sang the background vocals on the original recording of Time Is On My Side by Kai Winding, released by Verve Records in October 1963. She was one of the backup singers on the Paul Simon song \\"Mother and Child Reunion\\" (1972)\\r\\n\\r\\nHouston sang back-up on Bette Midler's 1972 debut album, The Divine Miss M. In 1974, Houston sang back-up on Linda Ronstadt's multi-Platinum Heart Like A Wheel, a seminal album that topped Billboards Pop and Country Album Charts in early 1975. In 1971, Houston was featured on three tracks of Burt Bacharach's self-titled solo album: \\"Mexican Divorce\\", \\"All Kinds of People\\" and \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\". During 1975 and 1976, she worked with jazz flautist Herbie Mann on three Atlantic albums, Discothque, Waterbed and Surprises, featuring on three tracks, \\"Violet Don't Be Blue\\", JJ Cale's \\"Cajun Moon\\" and \\"Easter Rising\\". In addition to her work as choirmaster at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, NJ, Cissy performed frequently at clubs in NYC including Mikell's, Sweetwaters, Seventh Avenue South, and Fat Tuesday from the late 1970s through the 1980s. Whitney Houston, her daughter and backup singer, increasingly sang solos with Cissy's band, including the Barbra Streisand hit \\"Evergreen\\". They would collaborate on \\"Ain't No Way\\" (originally a Cissy Houston and Aretha Franklin vehicle), on which Cissy sang \\"Cissy\\" and Whitney \\"Aretha\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Houston received the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album for Face to Face, an album that contained a Gospel version of \\"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\\".[citation needed] The same year, she contributed one song to the gospel soundtrack album for the film The Preacher's Wife, which starred her daughter Whitney Houston. In 1998, she won her second Grammy for her album He Leadeth Me.[citation needed] She has also continued to record infrequent secular material and in 1987, Houston and her daughter Whitney recorded a duet titled \\"I Know Him So Well\\", a cover of the original by Barbara Dickson and Elaine Paige from the Broadway show, Chess. This song also became a single in early 1989 as the 6th and last single release (in selected European countries) from Whitney's album Whitney. In 1992 she teamed up with Chuck Jackson for an album of solo and duet recordings entitled I'll Take Care of You.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, she recorded the song \\"Family First\\" with niece Dionne Warwick and daughter Whitney Houston for the soundtrack to the movie Daddy's Little Girls. In 2010, Cissy attended the third annual BET Honors with her daughter Whitney, who received the entertainment award. In 2012, Cissy performed \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" at the tribute for her daughter at the BET Music Awards. On September 29, 2014, at 80 years old,  Cissy sang backup to a standing-ovation performance with Aretha Franklin of  Adele's \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" and \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" on The Late Show with David Letterman.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than fifty years, Houston has led the 200-member Youth Inspirational Choir at the New Hope Baptist Church (Newark).[14] She is a driving force behind and performs annually at the McDonald's Gospelfest.","input":"What is whitney houston's mother's name?"},{"output":"September 27, 2001","context":"The eighth season of Friends, an American sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, premiered on NBC on September 27, 2001.

Until Section 3 of the Act was struck down in 2013 (United States v. Windsor), DOMA, in conjunction with other statutes, had barred same-sex married couples from being recognized as \\"spouses\\" for purposes of federal laws, effectively barring them from receiving federal marriage benefits. DOMA's passage did not prevent individual states from recognizing same-sex marriage, but it imposed constraints on the benefits received by all legally married same-sex couples.\\r\\nInitially introduced in May 1996, DOMA passed both houses of Congress by large, veto-proof majorities and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in September 1996. By defining \\"spouse\\" and its related terms to signify a heterosexual couple in a recognized marriage, Section 3 codified non-recognition of same-sex marriages for all federal purposes, including insurance benefits for government employees, social security survivors' benefits, immigration, bankruptcy, and the filing of joint tax returns, as well as excluding same-sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers (18 U. S. C. 115), laws evaluating financial aid eligibility, and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite-sex spouses.[1]:23ÿ24\\r\\nIn United States v. Windsor (2013), the U.S. Supreme Court declared Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) struck down the act's provisions disallowing same-sex marriages to be performed under federal jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of legal recognition of same-sex marriage attracted mainstream attention infrequently until the 1980s. A sympathetic reporter heard several gay men raise the issue in 1967 and described it as \\"high among the deviate's hopes\\".[2] In one early incident, gay activist Jack Baker brought suit against the state of Minnesota in 1970 after being denied a marriage license to marry another man; the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled (in Baker v. Nelson) that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples did not violate the Constitution. Baker later changed his legal name to Pat Lynn McConnell and married his male partner in 1971, but the marriage was not legally recognized.[3][4] A 1972 off-Broadway play, Nightride, depicted \\"a blackÿwhite homosexual marriage\\".[5][n 1] In 1979, IntegrityUSA, an organization of gay Episcopalians, raised the issue when the U.S. Episcopal Church considered a ban on the ordination of homosexuals as priests.[6][n 2]\\r\\nThe New York Times said the question was \\"all but dormant\\" until the late 1980s when, according to gay activists, \\"the AIDS epidemic...?brought questions of inheritance and death benefits to many people's minds.\\"[7] In May 1989, Denmark established registered partnerships that granted same-sex couples many of the rights associated with marriage.[7] In the same year, New York's highest court ruled that two homosexual men qualified as a family for the purposes of New York City's rent-control regulations.[7] Within the movement for gay and lesbian rights, a debate between advocates of sexual liberation and of social integration was taking shape, with Andrew Sullivan publishing an essay \\"Here Comes the Groom\\" in The New Republic in August 1989 arguing for same-sex marriage: \\"A need to rebel has quietly ceded to a desire to belong.\\"[4] In September 1989, the State Bar Association of California urged recognition of marriages between homosexuals even before gay rights advocates adopted the issue.[7]\\r\\nGary Bauer, head of the socially conservative Family Research Council, predicted the issue would be \\"a major battleground in the 1990s\\".[7] In 1991, Georgia Attorney General Michael J. Bowers withdrew a job offer to a lesbian who planned to marry another woman in a Jewish wedding ceremony.[8] In 1993, a committee of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America released a report asking Lutherans to consider blessing same-sex marriages and stating that lifelong abstinence was harmful to same-sex couples. The Conference of Bishops responded, \\"There is basis neither in Scripture nor tradition for the establishment of an official ceremony by this church for the blessing of a homosexual relationship.\\"[9] In a critique of radicalism in the gay liberation movement, Bruce Bawer's A Place at the Table (1993) advocated the legalization of same-sex marriage.[10]\\r\\nIn Baehr v. Miike (1993), the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled that the state must show a compelling interest in prohibiting same-sex marriage.[11] This finding prompted concern among opponents of same-sex marriage, who feared that same-sex marriage might become legal in Hawaii and that other states would recognize or be compelled to recognize those marriages under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. The House Judiciary Committee's 1996 Report called for DOMA as a response to Baehr, because \\"a redefinition of marriage in Hawaii to include homosexual couples could make such couples eligible for a whole range of federal rights and benefits\\".[12]\\r\\nThe main provisions of the act were as follows:[13]\\r\\nGeorgia Representative Bob Barr, then a Republican, authored the Defense of Marriage Act and introduced it in the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996. Senator Don Nickles, (R) Oklahoma, introduced the bill in the Senate.[14] The House Judiciary Committee stated that the Act was intended by Congress to \\"reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality\\".[15] The Act's congressional sponsors stated, \\"[T]he bill amends the U.S. Code to make explicit what has been understood under federal law for over 200 years; that a marriage is the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse is a husband or wife of the opposite sex.\\"[16]\\r\\nNickles said, \\"If some state wishes to recognize same-sex marriage, they can do so\\". He said the bill would ensure that \\"the 49 other states don't have to and the Federal Government does not have to.\\"[14] In opposition to the bill, Colorado Rep. Patricia Schroeder said, \\"You can't amend the Constitution with a statute. Everybody knows that. This is just stirring the political waters and seeing what hate you can unleash.\\"[14] Barr countered that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution grants Congress power to determine \\"the effect\\" of the obligation of each state to grant \\"full faith and credit\\" to other states' acts.[14]\\r\\nThe 1996 Republican Party platform endorsed DOMA, referencing only Section 2 of the act: \\"We reject the distortion of [anti-discrimination] laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions.\\"[17] The Democratic Party platform that year did not mention DOMA or same-sex marriage.[18] In a June 1996 interview in the gay and lesbian magazine The Advocate, Clinton said, \\"I remain opposed to same-sex marriage. I believe marriage is an institution for the union of a man and a woman. This has been my long-standing position, and it is not being reviewed or reconsidered.\\"[19] But he also criticized DOMA as \\"divisive and unnecessary.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe bill moved through Congress on a legislative fast track and met with overwhelming approval in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, with only 65 Democrats and then Rep. Bernie Sanders (Independent - Vermont) and Rep. Steve Gunderson (Republican - Wisconsin), in opposition, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives224 Republicans and 118 Democratsvoted to pass DOMA.[21][22] Then, on September 10, 1996, 84 Senatorsa majority of the Democratic Senators and all of the Republicansvoted in favor of DOMA.[23][24] Democratic Senators voted for the bill 32 to 14 (with Pryor of Arkansas absent), and Democratic Representatives voted for it 118 to 65, with 15 not participating. All Republicans in both houses voted for the bill with the sole exception of the one openly gay Republican Congressman, Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin.[24][25]\\r\\nWhile his stated position was against same-sex marriage, Clinton criticized DOMA as \\"unnecessary and divisive\\",[26] and his press-secretary called it \\"gay baiting, plain and simple\\".[27][28] However, after Congress had passed the bill with enough votes to override a presidential veto,[28] Clinton signed DOMA. Years later, he said that he did so reluctantly in view of the veto-proof majority, both to avoid associating himself politically with the then-unpopular cause of same-sex marriage and to defuse momentum for a proposed Federal Amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same-sex marriage.[28][29] Clinton, who was traveling when Congress acted, signed it into law promptly upon returning to Washington, D.C., on September 21, 1996;[30] no signing ceremony was held for DOMA and no photographs were taken of him signing it into law.[citation needed] The White House released a statement in which Clinton said \\"that the enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination, violence or intimidation against any person on the basis of sexual orientation\\".[30]\\r\\nIn 2013, Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary at the time, recalled that Clinton's \\"posture was quite frankly driven by the political realities of an election year in 1996.\\"[28] James Hormel, who was appointed by Clinton as the first openly gay U.S. Ambassador, described the reaction from the gay community to Clinton signing DOMA as shock and anger.[31] On Hormel's account, Clinton had been the first President to advocate gay rights, push for AIDS funding, support gay and lesbian civil rights legislation, and appoint open LGBT people to his Administration. Thus his signing of DOMA was viewed by much of the community as a great betrayal.\\r\\nClinton did not mention DOMA in his 2004 autobiography.[32] Over time, Clinton's public position on same-sex marriage shifted. He spoke out against the passage of California's Proposition 8 and recorded robocalls urging Californians to vote against it.[33] In July 2009, he officially came out in support for same-sex marriage.[34][35]\\r\\nOn August 13, 2009, during Netroots Nation, when confronted by LGBT activist Lane Hudson, Clinton explained that he had to sign DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment that would proscribe same-sex marriage: \\"We were attempting at the time, in a very reactionary Congress, to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states. And if you look at the eleven referenda much laterin 2004, in the electionwhich the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that.\\"[36][37]\\r\\nIn an op-ed written on March 7, 2013, for The Washington Post, Clinton again suggested that DOMA was necessary in order to preclude, at that time, the passage of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and urged the Supreme Court, which would shortly hear arguments on United States v. Windsor, to overturn DOMA.[38][39]\\r\\nClinton's explanation for signing DOMA has been disputed by gay rights activist Elizabeth Birch: \\"In 1996, I was President of the Human Rights Campaign, and there was no real threat of a Federal Marriage Amendment. That battle would explode about eight years later, in 2004, when President Bush announced it was a central policy goal of his administration to pass such an amendment.\\"[40]\\r\\nEvan Wolfson, who, in 1996, ran the National Freedom to Marry Coalition, while an attorney at Lambda Legal, has also criticized the suggestion that DOMA was stopping something worse: \\"That's complete nonsense. There was no conversation about something 'worse' until eight years later. There was no talk of a constitutional amendment, and no one even thought it was possibleand, of course, it turned out it wasn't really possible to happen. So, the idea that people were swallowing DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment is really just historic revisionism and not true. That was never an argument made in the '90s.\\"[41]\\r\\nHowever, political discussion of the possibility of using a constitutional amendment to restrict marriage rights was not unheard of in the 1990s. In January 1996, for example, the House Judiciary Committee for the state of Hawaii voted 12-1 in favor of passing bill HB 117, which was aimed at amending the constitution of Hawaii to define marriage as involving one man and one woman.[42] In 1998, the first anti-same-sex marriage amendment was added to the constitution of a U.S. state,[43] though it was not until 2002 that a federal marriage amendment was first introduced in the U.S. Congress.\\r\\nThe General Accounting Office issued a report in 1997 identifying \\"1,049 federal statutory provisions classified to the United States Code in which benefits, rights, and privileges are contingent on marital status or in which marital status is a factor\\".[44] In updating its report in 2004, the GAO found that this number had risen to 1,138 as of December 31, 2003.[45] With respect to Social Security, housing, and food stamps, the GAO found that \\"recognition of the marital relationship is integral to the design of the program[s].\\" The report also noted several other major program categories that were affectedveterans' benefits, including pensions and survivor benefits; taxes on income, estates, gifts, and property sales; and benefits due federal employees, both civilian and militaryand identified specifics such as the rights of the surviving spouse of a creator of copyrighted work and the financial disclosure requirements of spouses of Congress members and certain officers of the federal government. Education loan programs and agriculture price support and loan programs also implicate spouses. Financial aid to \\"family farms\\" for example, is restricted to those in which \\"a majority interest is held by individuals related by marriage or blood.\\"[44]\\r\\nBecause the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) controls most employee benefits provided by private employers, DOMA removed some tax breaks for employers and employees in the private sector when it comes to health care, pension, and disability benefits to same-sex spouses on an equal footing with opposite-sex spouses. ERISA does not affect employees of state and local government or churches, nor does it extend to such benefits as employee leave and vacation.[46]\\r\\nUnder DOMA, persons in same-sex marriages were not considered married for immigration purposes. U.S. citizens and permanent residents in same-sex marriages could not petition for their spouses, nor could they be accompanied by their spouses into the U.S. on the basis of a family or employment-based visa. A non-citizen in such a marriage could not use it as the basis for obtaining a waiver or relief from removal from the U.S.[47]\\r\\nFollowing the end of the U.S. military's ban on service by open gays and lesbians, \\"Don't ask, don't tell,\\" in September 2011, Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted that DOMA limited the military's ability to extend the same benefits to military personnel in same-sex marriages as their peers in opposite-sex marriages received, notably health benefits.[48] Same-sex spouses of military personnel were denied the same access to military bases, legal counseling, and housing allowances provided to different-sex spouses.[49]\\r\\nThe 2000 Republican Party platform endorsed DOMA in general terms and indicated concern about judicial activism: \\"We support the traditional definition of 'marriage' as the legal union of one man and one woman, and we believe that federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages.\\"[50] The Democratic Party platform that year did not mention DOMA or marriage in this context.[51]\\r\\nIn 2004, President George W. Bush endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples because he thought DOMA vulnerable: \\"After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization. Their actions have created confusion on an issue that requires clarity.\\"[52] In January 2005, however, he said he would not lobby on its behalf, since too many U.S. senators thought DOMA would survive a constitutional challenge.[53]\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama's 2008 political platform endorsed the repeal of DOMA.[54][55] On June 12, 2009, the Justice Department issued a brief defending the constitutionality of DOMA in the case of Smelt v. United States, continuing its longstanding practice of defending all federal laws challenged in court.[56] On June 15, 2009, Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese wrote an open letter to Obama that asked for actions to balance the DOJ's courtroom position: \\"We call on you to put your principles into action and send legislation repealing DOMA to Congress.\\"[57] A representative of Lambda Legal, an LGBT impact litigation and advocacy organization, noted that the Obama administration's legal arguments omitted the Bush administration's assertion that households headed by opposite-sex spouses were better at raising children than those headed by same-sex spouses.[56]\\r\\nOn February 23, 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder released a statement regarding lawsuits challenging DOMA Section 3. He wrote:[58]\\r\\nAfter careful consideration, including a review of my recommendation, the President has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The President has also concluded that Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional. Given that conclusion, the President has instructed the Department not to defend the statute in such cases.\\r\\nHe also announced that although it was no longer defending Section 3 in court, the administration intended to continue to enforce the law \\"unless and until Congress repeals Section 3 or the judicial branch renders a definitive verdict against the law's constitutionality.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn a separate letter to Speaker of the House John Boehner, Holder noted that Congress could participate in these lawsuits.[59]\\r\\nOn February 24, the Department of Justice notified the First Circuit Court of Appeals that it would \\"cease to defend\\" Gill and Massachusetts as well.[60] On July 1, 2011, the DOJ, with a filing in Golinski, intervened for the first time on behalf of a plaintiff seeking to have DOMA Section 3 ruled unconstitutional, arguing that laws that use sexual orientation as a classification need to pass the court's intermediate scrutiny standard of review.[61] The DOJ made similar arguments in a filing in Gill on July 7.[62]\\r\\nIn June 2012, filing an amicus brief in Golinski, two former Republican Attorneys General, Edwin Meese and John Ashcroft, called the DOJ's decision not to defend DOMA Section 3 \\"an unprecedented and ill-advised departure from over two centuries of Executive Branch practice\\" and \\"an extreme and unprecedented deviation from the historical norm\\".[63]\\r\\nOn March 4, 2011, Boehner announced that the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) would convene to consider whether the House of Representatives should defend DOMA Section 3 in place of the Department of Justice,[64][65] and on March 9 the committee voted 3ÿ2 to do so.[66]\\r\\nOn April 18, 2011, House leaders announced the selection of former United States Solicitor General Paul Clement to represent BLAG.[67] Clement, without opposition from other parties to the case, filed a motion to be allowed to intervene in the suit \\"for the limited purpose of defending the constitutionality of Section III\\" of DOMA.[68][69] On April 25, 2011, King & Spalding, the law firm through which Clement was handling the case, announced it was dropping the case. On the same day, Clement resigned from King & Spalding in protest and joined Bancroft PLLC, which took on the case.[70] The House's initial contract with Clement capped legal fees at $500,000,[71] but on September 30 a revised contract raised the cap to $1.5 million.[72] A spokesman for Boehner explained that BLAG would not appeal in all cases, citing bankruptcy cases that are \\"unlikely to provide the path to the Supreme Court....[E]ffectively defending [DOMA] does not require the House to intervene in every case, especially when doing so would be prohibitively expensive.\\"[73]\\r\\nOn September 15, 2009, three Democratic members of Congress, Jerrold Nadler of New York, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Jared Polis of Colorado, introduced legislation to repeal DOMA called the Respect for Marriage Act. The bill had 91 original co-sponsors in the House of Representatives[74][75] and was supported by Clinton, Barr, and several legislators who voted for DOMA.[76] Congressman Barney Frank and John Berry, head of the Office of Personnel Management, did not support that effort, stating that \\"the backbone is not there\\" in Congress. Frank and Berry suggested DOMA could be overturned more quickly through lawsuits such as Gill v. Office of Personnel Management filed by Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD).[77][78]\\r\\nFollowing Holder's announcement that the Obama Administration would no longer defend DOMA Section 3 in court, on March 16, 2011, Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate again[79] and Nadler introduced it in the House.[80] The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10ÿ8 in favor of advancing the bill to the Senate floor, but observers believed it would not gain the 60 votes needed to end debate and bring it to a vote.[81]\\r\\nAfter the Supreme Court struck down DOMA Section 3 on June 26, 2013, Feinstein and Nadler reintroduced the Respect for Marriage Act as S. 1236 and H.R. 2523.\\r\\nNumerous plaintiffs have challenged DOMA. Prior to 2009, all federal courts upheld DOMA in its entirety.\\r\\nLater cases focused on Section 3's definition of marriage. The courts, using different standards, have all found Section 3 unconstitutional. Requests for the Supreme Court to hear appeals were filed in five cases, listed below (with Supreme Court docket numbers):\\r\\nGolinski v. Office of Personnel Management is a challenge to Section 3 of DOMA in federal court based on a judicial employee's attempt to receive spousal health benefits for her wife. In 2008, Karen Golinski, a 19-year employee of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, applied for health benefits for her wife. When the application was denied, she filed a complaint under the Ninth Circuit's Employment Dispute Resolution Plan. Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, in his administrative capacity, ruled in 2009 that she was entitled to spousal health benefits,[82] but the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it would not comply with the ruling.\\r\\nOn March 17, 2011, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White dismissed the suit on procedural grounds but invited Golinski to amend her suit to argue the unconstitutionality of DOMA Section 3,[83] which she did on April 14.[84] Following the Attorney General's decision to no longer defend DOMA,[58] the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG), an arm of the House of Representatives, took up the defense. Former United States Solicitor General Paul Clement filed, on BLAG's behalf, a motion to dismiss raising arguments previously avoided by the Department of Justice: that DOMA's definition of marriage is valid \\"because only a man and a woman can beget a child together, and because historical experience has shown that a family consisting of a married father and mother is an effective social structure for raising children.\\"[85][86] On July 1, 2011, the DOJ filed a brief in support of Golinski's suit, in which it detailed for the first time its case for heightened scrutiny based on \\"a significant history of purposeful discrimination against gay and lesbian people, by governmental as well as private entities\\" and its arguments that DOMA Section 3 fails to meet that standard.[61][87]\\r\\nOn February 22, 2012, White ruled for Golinski, finding DOMA \\"violates her right to equal protection of the law under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\" He wrote that Section 3 of DOMA could not pass the \\"heightened scrutiny\\" or the \\"rational basis\\" test. He wrote,[88]\\r\\nThe Court finds that neither Congress' claimed legislative justifications nor any of the proposed reasons proffered by BLAG constitute bases rationally related to any of the alleged governmental interests. Further, after concluding that neither the law nor the record can sustain any of the interests suggested, the Court, having tried on its own, cannot conceive of any additional interests that DOMA might further.\\r\\nWhile the case was on appeal to the Ninth Circuit, on July 3, 2012, the DOJ asked the Supreme Court to review the case before the Ninth Circuit decides it so it can be heard together with two other cases in which DOMA Section 3 was held unconstitutional, Gill v. Office of Personnel Management and Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services.[89] The Supreme Court chose to hear Windsor instead of these cases, and following the Supreme Court decision in Windsor the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal in Golinski with the consent of all parties on July 23.[90]\\r\\nOn March 3, 2009, GLAD filed a federal court challenge, Gill v. Office of Personnel Management, based on the Equal Protection Clause and the federal government's consistent deference to each state's definition of marriage prior to the enactment of DOMA. The case questioned only the DOMA provision that the federal government defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman.[91][92] On May 6, 2010, Judge Joseph L. Tauro heard arguments in the U.S. District Court in Boston.[93]\\r\\nOn July 8, 2009, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley filed a suit, Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, challenging the constitutionality of DOMA. The suit claims that Congress \\"overstepped its authority, undermined states' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples, and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people.\\"[94] Tauro, the judge also handling Gill, heard arguments on May 26, 2010.[95]\\r\\nOn July 8, 2010, Tauro issued his rulings in both Gill and Massachusetts, granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs in both cases.[96][97] He found in Gill that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act violates the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In Massachusetts he held that the same section of DOMA violates the Tenth Amendment and falls outside Congress' authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution.[98][99] Those decisions were stayed after the DOJ filed an appeal on October 12, 2010.[100]\\r\\nOn November 3, 2011, 133 House Democrats filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs in Gill and Massachusetts, asserting their belief that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional.[101] Included among the members of Congress signing the brief were 14 members who had voted for the bill in 1996.[101] Seventy major employers also filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs.[102] A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case on April 4, 2012, during which the DOJ for the first time took the position that it could not defend Section 3 of DOMA under any level of scrutiny.[103] On May 31, 2012, the panel unanimously affirmed Tauro's ruling, finding Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional.[104][105] On June 29, BLAG filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.[106] The DOJ did so on July 3, while asking the Supreme Court to review Golinski as well.[89] The Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed a response to both petitions adding the Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment issues as questions presented.[n 3] The Supreme Court denied these petitions on June 27, 2013, following its decision in Windsor.\\r\\nOn November 9, 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison filed United States v. Windsor in New York on behalf of a surviving same-sex spouse whose inheritance from her deceased spouse had been subject to federal taxation as if they were unmarried.[107][108] New York is part of the Second Circuit, where no precedent exists for the standard of review to be followed in sexual-orientation discrimination cases.\\r\\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a brief supporting Windsor's claim on July 26, 2011.[109]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2012, Judge Barbara Jones ruled that based on rational basis review Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional and ordered the requested tax refund be paid to Windsor. The plaintiff commented, \\"It's thrilling to have a court finally recognize how unfair it is for the government to have treated us as though we were strangers.\\"[110] Windsor's attorneys filed a petition of certiorari with the Supreme Court on July 16, asking for the case to be considered without waiting for the Second Circuit's review.[111] On October 18, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling that Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional.[112][113] According to an ACLU press release, this ruling was \\"the first federal appeals court decision to decide that government discrimination against gay people gets a more exacting level of judicial review\\"[114] In an opinion authored by Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated:[115]\\r\\nOur straightforward legal analysis sidesteps the fair point that same-sex marriage is unknown to history and tradition, but law (federal or state) is not concerned with holy matrimony. Government deals with marriage as a civil statushowever fundamentaland New York has elected to extend that status to same-sex couples.\\r\\nOn December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were heard on March 27, 2013.[116] In a 5ÿ4 decision on June 26, 2013, the Court ruled Section 3 of DOMA to be unconstitutional, declaring it \\"a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment.\\"[1]:25\\r\\nOn July 18, 2013, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG), which had mounted a defense of Section 3 when the administration declined to, acknowledged that in Windsor \\"[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality\\" and said \\"it no longer will defend that statute.\\"[117]\\r\\nPedersen v. Office of Personnel Management is a case filed by GLAD in Connecticut on behalf of same-sex couples in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire, in which GLAD repeats the arguments it made in Gill.\\r\\nOn July 31, 2012, Judge Vanessa Bryant ruled that \\"having considered the purported rational bases proffered by both BLAG and Congress and concluded that such objectives bear no rational relationship to Section 3 of DOMA as a legislative scheme, the Court finds that that no conceivable rational basis exists for the provision. The provision therefore violates the equal protection principles incorporated in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\"[118] She held that \\"laws that classify people based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny by courts\\" but determined Section 3 of DOMA \\"fails to pass constitutional muster under even the most deferential level of judicial scrutiny.\\"[119][120] The case is currently on appeal to the Second Circuit, and on August 21, 2012, Pedersen asked the Supreme Court to review the case before the Second Circuit decides it so it can be heard together with Gill v. Office of Personnel Management and Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services.[121] The Supreme Court denied these petitions on June 27, 2013, following its decision in Windsor.\\r\\nOther cases that challenged DOMA include:[122]\\r\\nOn October 13, 2011, Carmen Cardona, a U.S. Navy veteran, filed a lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims seeking disability benefits for her wife that the Veterans Administration and the Board of Veterans Appeals had denied.[130] Cardona is represented by the Yale Law School Legal Services Clinic.[131] At the request of BLAG, which is defending the government's action, and over Cardona's objections, the court postponed oral argument in Cardona v. Shinseki pending the Supreme Court's disposition of writs of certiorari in other DOMA cases.[132]\\r\\nOn October 27, 2011, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) brought suit in federal court on behalf of several military servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. In a November 21 filing in the case of McLaughlin v. Panetta, they wrote, \\"Any claim that DOMA, as applied to military spousal benefits, survives rational basis review is strained because paying unequal benefits to service members runs directly counter to the military values of uniformity, fairness and unit cohesion.\\" The benefits at issue include medical and dental benefits, basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans.[133] The case was assigned to Judge Richard G. Stearns. One of the plaintiffs in the case, lesbian Charlie Morgan, who was undergoing chemotherapy, met with an assistant to Boehner on February 9, 2012, to ask him to consider not defending DOMA.[134] The case is on hold at the request of both sides in anticipation of the outcome of two other First Circuit cases on appeal, Gill v. Office of Personnel Management and Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services.[135] On February 17, the DOJ announced it could not defend the constitutionality of the statutes challenged in the case.[136] In May 2012, the parties filed briefs arguing whether BLAG has a right to intervene.[137] On June 27, Stearns asked the parties to explain by July 18 why given the decision in Windsor he should not find for the plaintiffs.[138] On July 18, BLAG's response acknowledged that \\"[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality\\" and asked to be allowed to withdraw from the case. It took no position on the two statutes at issue in the case, which define a \\"spouse\\" as \\"a person of the opposite sex\\", except to say that \\"the question of whether [that definition] is constitutional remains open\\".[139]\\r\\nTracey Cooper-Harris, an Army veteran from California, sued the Veterans Administration and the DOJ in federal court on February 1, 2012, asking for her wife to receive the benefits normally granted to spouses of disabled veterans.[140] BLAG sought a delay in Cooper-Harris v. United States pending the resolution of Golinski, which the attorneys for Cooper-Harris, the Southern Poverty Law Center, opposed. The court denied BLAG's motion on August 4.[141] In February 2013, Judge Consuelo Marshall rejected the DOJ's argument that the case could only be heard by the Board of Veterans' Appeals and allowed the case to proceed.[142] BLAG asked to withdraw from the lawsuit on July 22.[143]\\r\\nIn May 2011, DOMA-based challenges by the Department of Justice to joint petitions for bankruptcy by married same-sex couples were denied in two cases, one in the Southern District of New York on May 4 and one in the Eastern District of California on May 31. Both rulings stressed practical considerations and avoided ruling on DOMA.[144][145]\\r\\nOn June 13, 2011, 20 of the 25 judges of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California signed an opinion in the case in re Balas and Morales that found that a same-sex married couple filing for bankruptcy \\"have made their case persuasively that DOMA deprives them of the equal protection of the law to which they are entitled.\\" The decision found DOMA Section 3 unconstitutional and dismissed BLAG's objections to the joint filing:[146][147]\\r\\nAlthough individual members of Congress have every right to express their views and the views of their constituents with respect to their religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case. To do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This court cannot conclude from the evidence or the record in this case that any valid governmental interest is advanced by DOMA as applied to the Debtors.\\r\\nA spokesman for House Speaker Boehner said BLAG would not appeal the ruling,[148] On July 7, 2011, the DOJ announced that after consultation with BLAG it would no longer raise objections to \\"bankruptcy petitions filed jointly by same-sex couples who are married under state law\\".[149]\\r\\nBi-national same-sex couples were kept from legally living in the United States by DOMA's Section 3, which prevented one spouse from sponsoring the other for a green card.[150] Following some uncertainty after the Obama Administration determined Section 3 to be unconstitutional, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reaffirmed its policy of denying such applications.[151] With respect to obtaining a visitor's visa, Bureau rules treated bi-national same-sex spouses the same as bi-national opposite-sex unmarried partners under the classification \\"cohabiting partners\\".[152]\\r\\nTim Coco and Genesio J. Oliveira, a same-sex couple married in Massachusetts in 2005, successfully challenged this policy and developed a model since followed by other immigration activists.[153] The U.S. refused to recognize their marriage, and in 2007 Oliveira, a Brazilian national, accepted \\"voluntary departure\\" and returned to Brazil. They conducted a national press campaign[154] A Boston Globe editorial commented, \\"Great strides toward equality for gays have been made in this country, but the woeful fate of Tim Coco and Genesio Oliveira shows that thousands of same-sex couples, even in Massachusetts, still aren't really full citizens.\\"[155] The editorial gained the attention of Senator John F. Kerry, who first lobbied Attorney General Eric Holder without success.[156] He then gained the support of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who granted Oliveira humanitarian parole, enabling the couple to reunite in the U.S. in June 2010.[157] Humanitarian parole is granted on a case-by-case basis at the Secretary's discretion.[158]\\r\\nOn September 28, 2011, in Lui v. Holder, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson rejected a challenge to DOMA, citing Adams v. Howerton (1982).[159] The plaintiffs in that case had unsuccessfully challenged the denial of immediate relative status to the same-sex spouse of an American citizen.[160][161] Early in 2012, two bi-national same-sex couples were granted \\"deferred action\\" status, suspending deportation proceedings against the non-U.S. citizen for a year.[162][163] A similar Texas couple had a deportation case dismissed in March 2012, leaving the non-citizen spouse unable to work legally in the United States but no longer subject to the threat of deportation.[164]\\r\\nOn January 5, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago decided the suit of a same-sex binational couple. Demos Revelis and Marcel Maas, married in Iowa in 2010, sought to prevent the USCIS from applying Section 3 of DOMA to Revelis's application for a permanent residence visa for Maas and, in the court's words, \\"that their petition be reviewed and decided on the same basis as other married couples.\\"[165] Judge Harry D. Leinenweber, a Reagan appointee, denied the government's motion to dismiss. BLAG has argued for the suit to be dismissed.[166] In July the court stayed proceedings until mid-October because the USCIS was considering denying the plaintiffs' request on grounds unrelated to DOMA.[167]\\r\\nOn April 2, 2012, five bi-national same-sex couples represented by Immigration Equality and Paul, Weiss filed a lawsuit, Blesch v. Holder, in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, claiming that Section 3 of DOMA violated their equal protection rights by denying the U.S. citizen in the relationship the same rights in the green card application process granted a U.S. citizen who is in a relationship of partners of the opposite sex.[166] On July 25, Chief Judge Carol Bagley Amon stayed the case pending the resolution of Windsor by the Second Circuit.[168]\\r\\nImmigration rights advocate Lavi Soloway reported on June 19, 2012, that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) had in four cases responded to green card denials on the part of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by asking the USCIS to document the marital status of the same-sex couples and determine whether the foreign national would qualify for a green card in the absence of DOMA Section 3. He said the BIA is \\"essentially setting the stage for being able to approve the petitions in a post-DOMA universe.\\"[169]\\r\\nOn April 19, 2013, U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall ordered that a suit brought in July 2012 by Jane DeLeon, a Philippine citizen, and her spouse, Irma Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen, could proceed as a class action. The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, contended that DeLeon was denied a residency waiver because of DOMA Section 3.[170][171]\\r\\nOn June 28, 2013, the USCIS notified U.S. citizen Julian Marsh that it had approved the green card petition for his Bulgarian husband Traian Popov. Both are residents of Florida.[172] On July 3, the USCIS office in Centennial, Colorado, granted Cathy Davis, a citizen of Ireland, a green card based on her marriage to U.S. citizen Catriona Dowling.[173]\\r\\nIn 2009, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt declared DOMA unconstitutional in in re Levenson, an employment dispute resolution tribunal case, where the federal government refused to grant spousal benefits to Tony Sears, the husband of deputy federal public defender Brad Levenson.[174][175] As an employee of the federal judiciary, Levenson is prohibited from suing his employer in federal court. Rather, employment disputes are handled at employment dispute resolution tribunals in which a federal judge hears the dispute in their capacity as a dispute resolution official.\\r\\nSection 2 of DOMA states to give legal relief to any state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions. Various federal lawsuits, some filed alongside challenges to Section 3, have challenged Section 2.\\r\\nOn June 26, 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v.

This foreign presence marked the only time in Japan's history that it had been occupied by a foreign power.[1] The country became a parliamentary democracy that recalled \\"New Deal\\" priorities of the 1930s by Roosevelt.[2] The occupation, codenamed Operation Blacklist,[3] was ended by the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, and effective from April 28, 1952, after which Japan's sovereignty?ÿ with the exception, until 1972, of the Ryukyu Islands?ÿ  was fully restored.\\r\\nAccording to John Dower, in his book Cultures of War: Pearl Harbor/Hiroshima/9-11/Iraq, the factors behind the success of the occupation were:\\r\\nDiscipline, moral legitimacy, well-defined and well-articulated objectives, a clear chain of command, tolerance and flexibility in policy formulation and implementation, confidence in the ability of the state to act constructively, the ability to operate abroad free of partisan politics back home, and the existence of a stable, resilient, sophisticated civil society on the receiving end of occupation policies?ÿ these political and civic virtues helped make it possible to move decisively during the brief window of a few years when defeated Japan itself was in flux and most receptive to radical change.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan surrendered to the Allies on August 14, 1945, when the Japanese government notified the Allies that it had accepted the Potsdam Declaration. On the following day, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's unconditional surrender on the radio (the Gyokuon-hs). The announcement was the emperor's first ever planned radio broadcast and the first time most citizens of Japan ever heard their sovereign's voice.[5] This date is known as Victory over Japan, or V-J Day, and marked the end of World War II and the beginning of a long road to recovery for a shattered Japan. Japanese officials left for Manila, Philippines on August 19 to meet MacArthur and to be briefed on his plans for the occupation. On August 28, 1945, 150 US personnel flew to Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture. They were followed by USS Missouri,[6] whose accompanying vessels landed the 4th Marine Division on the southern coast of Kanagawa. Other Allied personnel followed.\\r\\nMacArthur arrived in Tokyo on August 30, and immediately decreed several laws. No Allied personnel were to assault Japanese people. No Allied personnel were to eat the scarce Japanese food. Flying the Hinomaru or \\"Rising Sun\\" flag was initially severely restricted (although individuals and prefectural offices could apply for permission to fly it). This restriction was partially lifted in 1948 and completely lifted the following year.[7]\\r\\nOn September 2, 1945, Japan formally surrendered with the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. On September 6, US President Truman approved a document titled \\"US Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan\\".[8] The document set two main objectives for the occupation: (1) eliminating Japan's war potential and (2) turning Japan into a democratic-style nation with pro-United Nations orientation. Allied (primarily American) forces were set up to supervise the country, and \\"for eighty months following its surrender in 1945, Japan was at the mercy of an army of occupation, its people subject to foreign military control.\\"[9] At the head of the Occupation administration was General MacArthur, who was technically supposed to defer to an advisory council set up by the Allied powers, but in practice did not and did everything himself. As a result, this period was one of significant American influence, described near the end of the occupation in 1951 that \\"for six years the United States has had a free hand to experiment with Japan than any other country in Asia, or indeed in the entire world.\\"[10] Looking back to his work in Japan, MacArthur described the Japanese reactions as acting similar to \\"a boy of twelve\\" and were at odds of putting away their troubled past.[11]\\r\\nOn V-J Day, US President Harry Truman appointed General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), to supervise the occupation of Japan. During the war, the Allied Powers had planned to divide Japan amongst themselves for the purposes of occupation, as was done for the occupation of Germany. Under the final plan, however, SCAP was given direct control over the main islands of Japan (Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu) and the immediately surrounding islands, while outlying possessions were divided between the Allied Powers as follows:\\r\\nIt is unclear why the occupation plan was changed. Common theories include the increased power of the United States following development of the atomic bomb, Truman's greater distrust of the Soviet Union when compared with Roosevelt, and an increased desire to restrict Soviet influence in East Asia after the Yalta Conference.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had some intentions of occupying Hokkaid.[12] Had this occurred, there might have eventually been a communist state in the Soviet zone of occupation. However, unlike the Soviet occupations of East Germany and North Korea, these plans were frustrated by Truman's opposition.[12]\\r\\nMacArthur's first priority was to set up a food distribution network; following the collapse of the ruling government and the wholesale destruction of most major cities, virtually everyone was starving. Even with these measures, millions of people were still on the brink of starvation for several years after the surrender.[13] As expressed by Kawai Kazuo, \\"Democracy cannot be taught to a starving people\\".[14] The US government encouraged democratic reform in Japan, and while it sent billions of dollars in food aid, this was dwarfed by the occupation costs it imposed on the struggling Japanese administration.[15][16]\\r\\nInitially, the US government provided emergency food relief through Government and Relief in Occupied Areas (GARIOA) funds. In fiscal year 1946, this aid amounted to US$92 million in loans. From April 1946, in the guise of Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia, private relief organizations were also permitted to provide relief. Once the food network was in place MacArthur set out to win the support of Hirohito. The two men met for the first time on September 27; the photograph of the two together is one of the most famous in Japanese history. Some were shocked that MacArthur wore his standard duty uniform with no tie instead of his dress uniform when meeting the emperor. With the sanction of Japan's reigning monarch, MacArthur had the ammunition he needed to begin the real work of the occupation. While other Allied political and military leaders pushed for Hirohito to be tried as a war criminal, MacArthur resisted such calls, arguing that any such prosecution would be overwhelmingly unpopular with the Japanese people. He also rejected the claims of members of the imperial family such as Prince Mikasa and Prince Higashikuni and demands of intellectuals like Tatsuji Miyoshi, who sought the emperor's abdication.[17]\\r\\nBy the end of 1945, more than 350,000 US personnel were stationed throughout Japan. By the beginning of 1946, replacement troops began to arrive in the country in large numbers and were assigned to MacArthur's Eighth Army, headquartered in Tokyo's Dai-Ichi building. Of the main Japanese islands, Kysh was occupied by the 24th Infantry Division, with some responsibility for Shikoku. Honshu was occupied by the First Cavalry Division. Hokkaido was occupied by the 11th Airborne Division.\\r\\nBy June 1950, all these army units had suffered extensive troop reductions and their combat effectiveness was seriously weakened. When North Korea invaded South Korea in the Korean War, elements of the 24th Division were flown into South Korea to try to fight the invasion force there, but the inexperienced occupation troops, while acquitting themselves well when suddenly thrown into combat almost overnight, suffered heavy casualties and were forced into retreat until other Japan occupation troops could be sent to assist.\\r\\nThe official British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), composed of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand personnel, was deployed on February 21, 1946. While US forces were responsible for the overall occupation, BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarization and the disposal of Japan's war industries.[18] BCOF was also responsible for occupation of several western prefectures and had its headquarters at Kure. At its peak, the force numbered about 40,000 personnel. During 1947, BCOF began to decrease its activities in Japan, and officially wound up in 1951.\\r\\nThe Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council for Japan were also established to supervise the occupation of Japan.[19] The establishment of a multilateral Allied council for Japan was proposed by the Soviet government as early as September 1945, and was supported partially by the British, French and Chinese governments.[20]\\r\\nJapan's postwar constitution, adopted under Allied supervision, included a \\"Peace Clause\\", Article 9, which renounced war and banned Japan from maintaining any armed forces. This clause was not imposed by the Allies: rather, it was the work of the Japanese government itself, and according to most sources, was the work of Prime Minister Kijr Shidehara.[21][22] The clause was intended to prevent the country from ever becoming an aggressive military power again. However, the United States was soon pressuring Japan to rebuild its army as a bulwark against communism in Asia after the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. During the Korean War, US forces largely withdrew from Japan to redeploy to South Korea, leaving the country almost totally defenseless. As a result, a new National Police Reserve armed with military-grade weaponry was created. In 1954, the Japan Self-Defense Forces were founded as a full-scale military in all but name. To avoid breaking the constitutional prohibition on military force, they were officially founded as an extension to the police force. Traditionally, Japan's military spending has been restricted to about 1% of its gross national product, though this is by popular practice, not law, and has fluctuated up and down from this figure. Prime Ministers Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzo Abe, among others, have tried to repeal or amend the clause. The JSDF slowly grew to considerable strength, and Japan now has the eighth largest military budget in the world.[23]\\r\\nAll the major sectors of the Japanese society, government, and economy were liberalized in the first few years and won strong support from liberals in Japan.[24] Historians emphasize the similarity to the American New Deal programs of the 1930s.[25] Moore and Robinson note that, \\"New Deal liberalism seemed natural, even to conservative Republicans such as MacArthur and Whitney.\\"[26] The issuing of the Removal of Restrictions on Political, Civil, and Religious Liberties directive by SCAP on October 4, 1945, led to the abolishment of the Peace Preservation Law and the release of all political prisoners.[27][28]\\r\\nFrom late 1947, US priorities shifted to internal political stability and economic growth. Economic deconcentration, for example, was left uncompleted as GHQ responded to new imperatives. American authorities encouraged business practices and industrial policies that have since become sources of contention between Japan and its major trade partners, notably the United States.[29] During the occupation, GHQ/SCAP mostly abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the Zaibatsu, which had previously monopolized industry.[30] Along with the later American change of heart, and due in part to the need for an economically stronger Japan in the face of a perceived Soviet threat, these economic reforms were also hampered by the wealthy and influential Japanese who stood to lose a great deal. As such, there were those who consequently resisted any attempts at reform, claiming that the zaibatsu were required for Japan to compete internationally, and looser industrial groupings known as keiretsu evolved. A major land reform was also conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky of General Douglas MacArthur's SCAP staff. However, Ladejinsky has stated that the real architect of reform was Hiro Wada, former Japanese Minister of Agriculture.[31] Between 1947 and 1949, approximately 5,800,000 acres (23,000?km2) of land (approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) were purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program and resold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.[32]\\r\\nIn 1946, the Diet ratified a new Constitution of Japan that followed closely a 'model copy' prepared by the GHQ/SCAP,[33] and was promulgated as an amendment to the old Prussian-style Meiji Constitution. The new constitution drafted by Americans allowed access and control over the Japanese military through MacArthur and the Allied occupation on Japan.[34] \\"The political project drew much of its inspiration from the U.S. Bill of Rights, New Deal social legislation, the liberal constitutions of several European states and even the Soviet Union.... (It) transferred sovereignty from the Emperor to the people in an attempt to depoliticize the Throne and reduce it to the status of a state symbol. Included in the revised charter was the famous 'no war', 'no arms' Article Nine, which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The 1947 Constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.\\"[35] One example of MacArthur's push towards democratization implemented the land reform and redistribution of ownership within the agricultural system.[36] The land reform was established in order to improve not only the economy but the welfare of farmers as well.[37] MacArthur's land reform policy redistribution resulted in only 10% of the land being worked by non-owners.[36] On December 15, 1945, the Shinto Directive was issued abolishing Shinto as a state religion and prohibiting some of its teachings and rites that were deemed to be militaristic or ultra-nationalistic. On April 10, 1946, an election with 78.52% voter turnout among men and 66.97% among women[38] gave Japan its first modern prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida.\\r\\nIn 1945 the Diet passed Japan's first ever trade union law protecting the rights of workers to form or join a union, to organize, and take industrial action. There had been pre-war attempts to do so, but none that were successfully passed until the Allied occupation.[39] A new Trade Union Law was passed on June 1, 1949, which remains in place to the present day. According to Article 1 of the Act, the purpose of the act is to \\"elevate the status of workers by promoting their being on equal standing with the employer\\".[40]\\r\\nThe Labor Standards Act was enacted on April 7, 1947, to govern working conditions in Japan. According to Article 1 of the Act, its goal is to ensure that \\"Working conditions shall be those which should meet the needs of workers who live lives worthy of human beings.\\"[41] Support stemming from the Allied occupation has introduced better working conditions and pay for numerous employees in Japanese business.[36] This allowed for more sanitary and hygienic working environments along with welfare and government assistance for health insurance, pensions plans and work involving other trained specialists.[36] While it was created while Japan was under occupation, the origins of the Act have nothing to do with the occupation forces. It appears to have been the brainchild of Kosaku Teramoto, a former member of the Thought Police, who had become the head of the Labor Standards section of the Welfare Ministry.[42]\\r\\nBefore and during the war, Japanese education was based on the German system, with \\"Gymnasien\\" (selective grammar schools) and universities to train students after primary school. During the occupation, Japan's secondary education system was changed to incorporate three-year junior high schools and senior high schools similar to those in the US: junior high school became compulsory but senior high school remained optional. The Imperial Rescript on Education was repealed, and the Imperial University system reorganized. The longstanding issue of Japanese script reform, which had been planned for decades but continuously opposed by more conservative elements, was also resolved during this time. The Japanese written system was drastically reorganized with the Ty kanji-list in 1946, predecessor of today's Jy kanji, and orthography was greatly altered to reflect spoken usage.\\r\\nPrior to World War II, women in Japan were denied the right to vote and other legal rights. With the defeat of the traditionalist government, the occupation authorities, on the order of general Douglas MacArthur, began drafting a new constitution for Japan in February 1946.[43] A subcommittee including two women, Beate Sirota Gordon and economist Eleanor Hadley, was enlisted and assigned to writing the section of the constitution devoted to civil rights and women's rights in Japan.[44] They played an integral role, drafting the language regarding legal equality between men and women in Japan,[45] including Articles 14 and 24 on Equal Rights and Women's Civil Rights. Article 14 states, in part: \\"All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin\\". Article 24 includes:\\r\\nMarriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis. 2) With regard to choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters pertaining to marriage and the family, laws shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes.\\r\\nThese additions to the constitution were vital to women's rights in Japan. \\"Japanese women were historically treated like chattel; they were property to be bought and sold on a whim,\\" Gordon said in 1999.[46]\\r\\nOn October 4, 1945, the GHQ issued the Removal of Restrictions on Political, Civil, and Religious Liberties directive. The directive ordered the release of political prisoners.[47]\\r\\nWhile these other reforms were taking place, various military tribunals, most notably the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Ichigaya, were trying Japan's war criminals and sentencing many to death and imprisonment. However, many suspects such as Masanobu Tsuji, Nobusuke Kishi, Yoshio Kodama and Ryichi Sasakawa were never judged, while the Emperor Hirohito, all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni and Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda, and all members of Unit 731including its director Dr. Shir Ishiiwere granted immunity from criminal prosecution by General MacArthur.\\r\\nBefore the war crimes trials actually convened, the SCAP, the IPS and Shwa officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the imperial family from being indicted, but also to slant the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the Emperor. High officials in court circles and the Shwa government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as Class A suspects and incarcerated in Sugamo prison solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility.[48] Thus, months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for Pearl Harbor to Hideki Tojo\\"[49] by allowing \\"the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.\\"[50] and \\"with the full support of MacArthur's headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor.[51]\\r\\nFor historian John W. Dower,\\r\\nEven Japanese peace activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize Japanese atrocities, cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of Cold war, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-wing war criminals like the later prime minister Kishi Nobusuke.[52]\\r\\nIn retrospect, apart from the military officer corps, the purge of alleged militarists and ultranationalists that was conducted under the Occupation had relatively small impact on the long-term composition of men of influence in the public and private sectors. The purge initially brought new blood into the political parties, but this was offset by the return of huge numbers of formally purged conservative politicians to national as well as local politics in the early 1950s. In the bureaucracy, the purge was negligible from the outset.... In the economic sector, the purge similarly was only mildly disruptive, affecting less than sixteen hundred individuals spread among some four hundred companies. Everywhere one looks, the corridors of power in postwar Japan are crowded with men whose talents had already been recognized during the war years, and who found the same talents highly prized in the \\"new\\" Japan.[53]\\r\\nAccording to various accounts, U.S. troops committed thousands of rapes among the population of the Ryukyu Islands during the Okinawa Campaign and the beginning of the American occupation in 1945.[54][55]\\r\\nMany Japanese civilians in the Japanese mainland feared that the Allied occupation troops were likely to rape Japanese women. The Japanese authorities set up a large system of prostitution facilities (Recreation and Amusement Association, or the RAA) in order to protect the population. According to John W. Dower, precisely as the Japanese government had hoped when it created the prostitution facilities, while the RAA was in place \\"the incidence of rape remained relatively low given the huge size of the occupation force\\".[56]:130 However, there was a resulting large rise in venereal disease among the soldiers, which led MacArthur to close down the prostitution in early 1946.[57] The incidence of rape increased after the closure of the brothels, possibly eight-fold; Dower states that \\"According to one calculation the number of rapes and assaults on Japanese women amounted to around 40 daily while the RAA was in operation, and then rose to an average of 330 a day after it was terminated in early 1946.\\"[58] Michael S. Molasky states that while rape and other violent crime were widespread in naval ports like Yokosuka and Yokohama during the first few weeks of occupation, according to Japanese police reports and journalistic studies, the number of incidents declined shortly after and they were not common on mainland Japan throughout the rest of occupation.[59] Two weeks into the occupation, the Occupation administration began censoring all media. This included any mention of rape or other sensitive social issues.[60][61]\\r\\nAccording to Dower, \\"more than a few incidents\\" of assault and rape were never reported to the police.[62] According to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or rape-murder were reported on Okinawa during the first five years of occupation, but according to Tanaka this is \\"but the tip of the iceberg\\" as most of the rapes went unreported.[63]\\r\\nAfter the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers abolished all forms of censorship and controls on Freedom of Speech, which was also integrated into Article 21 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. However, press censorship remained a reality in the post-war era, especially in matters of pornography, and in political matters deemed subversive by the American government during the occupation of Japan.\\r\\nThe Allied occupation forces suppressed news of criminal activities such as rape; on September 10, 1945, SCAP \\"issued press and pre-censorship codes outlawing the publication of all reports and statistics 'inimical to the objectives of the Occupation'.\\"[64]\\r\\nAccording to David M. Rosenfeld:\\r\\nNot only did Occupation censorship forbid criticism of the United States or other Allied nations, but the mention of censorship itself was forbidden. This means, as Donald Keene observes, that for some producers of texts \\"the Occupation censorship was even more exasperating than Japanese military censorship had been because it insisted that all traces of censorship be concealed. This meant that articles had to be rewritten in full, rather than merely submitting XXs for the offending phrases.\\"\\r\\nTo further remove Japan as a potential future threat to the United States, the Far Eastern Commission decided that Japan was to be partly de-industrialized. The necessary dismantling of Japanese industry was foreseen to have been achieved if Japanese standards of living had been reduced to those existing in Japan the period 1930ÿ1934.[66][67] In the end, the adopted program of de-industrialization in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar U.S. \\"industrial disarmament\\" program in Germany.[66] In view of the cost to American taxpayers for emergency food aid to Japan, in April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the economy of Japan should instead be reconstructed. The report included suggestions for reductions in war reparations, and a relaxation of the \\"economic deconcentration\\" policy. For the fiscal year of 1949 funds were moved from the GARIOA budget into an Economic Rehabilitation in Occupied Areas (EROA) programme, to be used for the import of materials needed for economic reconstruction.\\r\\nWith the acceptance of the Allied occupation authorities, the Japanese organized a brothel system for the benefit of the more than 300,000 occupation troops. \\"The strategy was, through the special work of experienced women, to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls.\\"\\r\\nIn December 1945, a senior officer with the Public Health and Welfare Division of the occupation's General Headquarters wrote regarding the typical prostitute: \\"The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family\\", he wrote. \\"It is the belief of our informants, however, that in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists. The worst victims ... were the women who, with no previous experience, answered the ads calling for 'Women of the New Japan'.\\"\\r\\nMacArthur issued an order, SCAPIN 642 (SCAP Instruction), on January 21 ending licensed brothels for being \\"in contravention of the ideals of democracy\\". Although SCAPIN 642 ended the RAA's operations, it did not affect \\"voluntary prostitution\\" by individuals. Ultimately, SCAP responded by making all brothels and other facilities offering prostitution off-limits to Allied personnel on March 25, 1946.[68] By November, the Japanese government had introduced the new akasen (?, \\"red-line\\") system in which prostitution was permissible only in certain designated areas.[69][70]\\r\\nThe surrender of Imperial Japan meant reversal of its previous annexationsManchuria (Manchukuo as a puppet regime under Japan) was returned to China, while Korea regained its independence and was divided in two by the United States and Soviet Union.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union claimed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, with 400,000 Japanese fleeing or expelled. Similar actions happened in Taiwan and Manchuria after their return to China, while Korea saw the flight of over 800,000 Japanese settlers. In all, Japanese repatriation centers handled over 7 million expatriates returning to the Japanese main islands.[71]\\r\\nIn a bid to occupy as much Japanese territory as possible, Soviet troops continued offensive military operations after the Japanese surrender, causing large scale civilian casualties.[72]\\r\\nUnlike the case in Germany, Japan retained a native government throughout the occupation. Although MacArthur's official staff history of the occupation referred to \\"the Eighth Army Military Government System\\", it explained that while \\"In Germany, with the collapse of the Nazi regime, all government agencies disintegrated, or had to be purged\\", the Japanese retained an \\"integrated, responsible government and it continued to function almost intact\\":[73]\\r\\nIn effect, there was no \\"military government\\" in Japan in the literal sense of the word. It was simply a SCAP superstructure over already existing government machinery, designed to observe and assist the Japanese along the new democratic channels of administration.\\r\\nGeneral Horace Robertson of Australia, head of BCOF, wrote:[74]\\r\\nMacArthur at no time established in Japan what could be correctly described as Military government. He continued to use the Japanese government to control the country, but teams of military personnel, afterward replaced to quite a considerable extent by civilians, were placed throughout the Japanese prefectures as a check on the extent to which the prefectures were carrying out the directives issued by MacArthurs headquarters or the orders from the central government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe really important duty of the so called Military government teams was, however, the supervision of the issue throughout Japan of the large quantities of food stuffs and medical stores being poured into the country from American sources. The teams also contained so-called experts on health, education, sanitation, agriculture and the like, to help the Japanese in adopting more up to date methods sponsored by SCAPs headquarters. The normal duties of a military government organisation, the most important of which are law and order and a legal system, were never needed in Japan since the Japanese governments normal legal system still functioned with regard to all Japanese nationals ... The so-called military government in Japan was therefore neither military nor government.\\r\\nThe Japanese government's de facto authority was strictly limited at first, however, and senior figures in the government such as the Prime Minister effectively served at the pleasure of the occupation authorities before the first post-war elections were held. Political parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the occupation began. Left-wing organizations, such as the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party, quickly reestablished themselves, as did various conservative parties. The old Seiyukai and Rikken Minseito came back as, respectively, the Liberal Party (Nihon Jiyuto) and the Japan Progressive Party (Nihon Shimpoto). The first postwar elections were held in 1946 (women were given the franchise for the first time), and the Liberal Party's vice president, Yoshida Shigeru (1878ÿ1967), became prime minister. For the 1947 elections, anti-Yoshida forces left the Liberal Party and joined forces with the Progressive Party to establish the new Japan Democratic Party (Minshuto). This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a cabinet, which lasted less than a year. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes. After a short period of Democratic Party administration, Yoshida returned in late 1948 and continued to serve as prime minister until 1954.\\r\\nJapan accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered on August 15, 1945. Over 5,000 Japanese Americans served in the occupation of Japan.[75] Dozens of Japanese Americans served as translators, interpreters, and investigators in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Thomas Sakamoto served as press escort during the occupation of Japan. He escorted American correspondents to Hiroshima, and the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Sakamoto was one of three Japanese Americans to be on board the USS Missouri when the Japanese formally surrendered. Arthur S. Komori served as personal interpreter for Brig. Gen. Elliot R. Thorpe. Kay Kitagawa served as personal interpreter of Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr..[76] Kan Tagami served as personal interpreter-aide for General Douglas MacArthur.[77] Journalist Don Caswell was accompanied by a Japanese American interpreter to Fuch Prison, where the Japanese government imprisoned communists Tokuda Kyuichi, Yoshio Shiga, and Shiro Mitamura.[78]\\r\\nJapanese Americans in the OSS parachuted down into Japanese POW prison camps at Hankow, Mukden, Peiping and Hainan as interpreters on mercy missions to liberate American and other Allied prisoners.[79] Arthur T. Morimitsu was the only Military Intelligence Service member in the detachment commanded by Major Richard Irby and 1st Lt. Jeffrey Smith to observe the surrender ceremony of 60,000 Japanese troops under Gen. Shimada.[80] Kan Tagami witnessed Japanese forces surrender to the British in Malaya.[77]\\r\\nIn 1949, MacArthur made a sweeping change in the SCAP power structure that greatly increased the power of Japan's native rulers, and the occupation began to draw to a close. The Treaty of San Francisco, which was to end the occupation, was signed on September 8, 1951. It came into effect on April 28, 1952, formally ending all occupation powers of the Allied forces and restoring full sovereignty to Japan, except for the island chains of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, which the United States continued to hold. Iwo Jima was returned to Japan in 1968, and most of Okinawa was returned in 1972.\\r\\nFollowing the American departure, Japan gained military protection from the United States. However, the United States was soon pressuring Japan to rebuild its military capabilities, and as a result, the Japan Self-Defense Forces were formed as a de facto military force with US assistance. However, following the Yoshida Doctrine, Japan continued to prioritize economic growth over defense spending, relying on American protection to ensure it could focus mainly on economic recovery. Through Guided Capitalism, Japan was able to optimally utilize its resources to economically recover from the war, and revive industry.[81] Some 31,000 US military personnel remain in Japan today at the invitation of the Japanese government as the United States Forces Japan under the terms of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan (1960) and not as an occupying force. US bases in and around Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Aomori, Sapporo, and Ishikari are currently active.\\r\\nOn the day the occupation of Japan was over, the Asahi Shimbun published a very critical essay on the occupation, claiming it turned the Japanese population \\"irresponsible, obsequious and listless... unable to perceive issues in a forthright manner, which led to distorted perspectives\\".[82] The purpose for delaying the return of the Japanese southern islands, the Bonin Islands including Chichi Jima, Okinawa, and the Volcano Islands including Iwo Jima to civil administration was the U.S. military's requirement to covertly base U.S. atomic weapons or their components on the islands where the presence or expansion of U.S. bases remain a heated controversy to this day.\\r\\nHirohitos surrender broadcast was a profound shock to Japanese citizens. After years of being told about Japans military might and the inevitability of victory, these beliefs were proven false in the space of a few minutes. But for many people, these were only secondary concerns since they were also facing starvation and homelessness.\\r\\nPost-war Japan was chaotic. The air raids on Japan's urban centers left millions displaced and food shortages, created by bad harvests and the demands of the war, worsened when the seizure of food from Korea, Taiwan, and China ceased.[83] Repatriation of Japanese living in other parts of Asia and hundreds of thousands of demobilized prisoners of war only aggravated the problems in Japan as these people put more strain on already scarce resources. Over 5.1 million Japanese returned to Japan in the fifteen months following October 1, 1945, and another million returned in 1947.[84] Alcohol and drug abuse became major problems. Deep exhaustion, declining morale and despair were so widespread that it was termed the \\"kyodatsu condition\\" (О?B, kyodatsujoutai, lit. \\"state of lethargy\\").[85] Inflation was rampant and many people turned to the black market for even the most basic goods. These black markets in turn were often places of turf wars between rival gangs, like the Shibuya incident in 1946. Prostitution also increased considerably.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, kasutori culture emerged. In response to the scarcity of the previous years, this sub-culture, named after the preferred drink of the artists and writers who imbibed it, emphasized escapism, entertainment and decadence.[86]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"shikata ga nai\\", or \\"nothing can be done about it,\\" was commonly used in both Japanese and American press to encapsulate the Japanese public's resignation to the harsh conditions endured while under occupation. However, not everyone reacted the same way to the hardships of the postwar period. While some succumbed to the difficulties, many more were resilient. As the country regained its footing, they were able to bounce back as well.\\r\\nLeftists looked upon the occupation forces as a \\"liberation army\\".[87]\\r\\nIt has been argued that the granting of rights to women played an important role in the radical shift Japan underwent from a war nation to a democratized and demilitarized country.[88] In the first postwar general elections of 1946, over a third of the votes were cast by women. This unexpectedly high female voter turnout led to the election of 39 female candidates, and the increasing presence of women in politics was perceived by Americans as evidence of an improvement of Japanese women's condition.[89]\\r\\nAmerican feminists saw Japanese women as victims of feudalistic and chauvinistic traditions that had to be broken by the Occupation. American women assumed a central role in the reforms that affected the lives of Japanese women: they educated Japanese about Western ideals of democracy, and it was an American woman who wrote the Japanese Equal Rights Amendment for the new constitution.[90] General Douglas MacArthur did not mean for Japanese women to give up their central role in the home as wives and mothers, but rather that they could now assume other roles simultaneously, such as that of worker.[91][92]\\r\\nIn 1953, journalist Ichir Narumigi commented that Japan had received \\"liberation of sex\\" along with the \\"four presents\\" that it had been granted by the occupation (respect for human rights, gender equality, freedom of speech, and womens enfranchisement).[93] Indeed, the occupation also had a great impact on relationships between man and woman in Japan. The \\"modern girl\\" phenomenon of the 1920s and early 1930s had been characterized by greater sexual freedom, but despite this, sex was usually not perceived as a source of pleasure (for women) in Japan. Westerners, as a result, were thought to be promiscuous and sexually deviant.[94] The sexual liberation of European and North American women during World War II was unthinkable in Japan, especially during wartime where rejection of Western ways of life was encouraged.[95]\\r\\nThe Japanese public was thus astounded by the sight of some 45,000 so-called \\"pan pan girls\\" (prostitutes) fraternizing with American soldiers during the occupation.[93] In 1946, the 200 wives of US officers landing in Japan to visit their husbands also had a similar impact when many of these reunited couples were seen walking hand in hand and kissing in public.[96] Both prostitution and marks of affection had been hidden from the public until then, and this \\"democratization of eroticism\\" was a source of surprise, curiosity, and even envy. The occupation set new models for relationships between Japanese men and women: the western practice of \\"dating\\" spread, and activities such as dancing, movies and coffee were not limited to \\"pan pan girls\\" and American troops anymore, and became popular among young Japanese couples.[97]","input":"When did the us occupation of japan end?"},{"output":"on 1 March 1950","context":"The Qaumi Taranah (Urdu: ???? ???????, Qaumؐ Tarnah pronounced?[?q??.mi ?t??.r?.n], lit. National Anthem), also known as Pk Sarzamؐn (Urdu: ??? ????????, pronounced?[?p?k ?s?r.z?.mi?n], lit. The Sacred Land), is the national anthem of Pakistan. Its music was composed by Ahmad G. Chagla in 1949, preceding the lyrics, which were written by Hafeez Jullundhri in 1952. It was officially adopted as Pakistan's national anthem in August 1954[1] and was recorded in the same year by eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi, Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum, Najam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir, Anwar Zaheer and Akhtar Wasi Ali.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1948, A. R. Ghani, a Muslim from Transvaal, South Africa, offered two prizes of five thousand rupees each for the poet and composer of a new national anthem for the newly independent state of Pakistan. The prizes were announced through a government press advertisement published in June 1948. In December 1948, the Government of Pakistan established the National Anthem Committee (NAC) with the task of coming up with the composition and lyrics for the official national anthem of Pakistan. The NAC was initially chaired by the Information Secretary, Sheikh Muhammad Ikram, and its members included several politicians, poets and musicians, including Abdur Rab Nishtar, Ahmad G. Chagla and Hafeez Jullundhri.[citation needed] The NAC encountered early difficulties in finding suitable music and lyrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen President Sukarno of Indonesia became the first foreign head of state to visit Pakistan on 30 January 1950, there was no Pakistani national anthem to be played. In 1950, the impending state visit of the Shah of Iran added urgency to the matter and resulted in the Government of Pakistan asking the NAC to submit an anthem without further delay. The NAC Chairman, then Federal Minister for Education, Fazlur Rahman, asked several poets and composers to write lyrics but none of the submitted works were deemed suitable. The NAC also examined several different tunes and eventually selected the one presented by Ahmed G. Chagla and submitted it for formal approval.[3] On 21 August 1949, the Government of Pakistan adopted Chaglas tune for the national anthem.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anthem, without lyrics, was performed for the first time for a foreign head of state on the state visit of the Shah of Iran to Pakistan in Karachi on 1 March 1950 by a Pakistan Navy band.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was later played for Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan during his official visit to the United States on 3 May 1950. It was played before the NAC on 10 August 1950.[5] Official recognition to the national anthem, however, was not given until August 1954.[5] The NAC distributed records of the composed tune amongst prominent poets, who responded by writing and submitting several hundred songs for evaluation by the NAC. Eventually, the lyrics written by Hafeez Jullundhri were approved and the new national anthem was broadcast publicly for the first time on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954, sung by Hafeez Jullundhri himself. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16 August 1954. The composer, Ahmed G. Chagla, died in 1953, before the new national anthem was officially adopted. In 1955, there was a performance of the national anthem involving 11 major singers of Pakistan, including Ahmad Rushdi, Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum, Najam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir, Anwar Zaheer and Akhtar Wasi Ali.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Qaumi Taranah is a melodious and harmonious rendering of a three-stanza composition with a tune based on eastern music but arranged in such a manner that it can be easily played by foreign bands.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music, composed by the Pakistani musician and composer, Ahmad G.

There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 4th century BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that there is no effect or motion without a cause. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element earth, was related to their nature, which caused them to move downward toward the center of the universe, which was their natural place.  Conversely, light bodies such as the element fire, move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the sphere of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the Earth by an external force of gravity, but tend toward the center of the universe because of an inner gravitas or heaviness.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Book VII of his De Architectura, the Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius contends that gravity is not dependent on a substance's \\"weight\\" but rather on its \\"nature\\" (cf. specific gravity).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the quicksilver is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord. Hence, it is undeniable that the gravity of a substance depends not on the amount of its weight, but on its nature.[3]\\r\\nAryabhata first identified the force to explain why objects do not fall when the Earth rotates, and developed a geocentric solar system of gravitation, with an eccentric elliptical model of the planets, where the planets spin on their axes and follow elliptical orbits, the Sun and the Moon revolving around the Earth in epicycles. Indian astronomer and mathematician Brahmagupta described gravity as an attractive force and used the term \\"gurutvkar?a?\\" for gravity.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAl Hamdnؐ and Al Biruni quote Brahmagupta saying \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Disregarding this, we say that the earth on all its sides is the same; all people on the earth stand upright, and all heavy things fall down to the earth by a law of nature, for it is the nature of the earth to attract and to keep things, as it is the nature of water to flow, that of fire to burn, and that of the wind to set in motion. If a thing wants to go deeper down than the earth, let it try. The earth is the only low thing, and seeds always return to it, in whatever direction you may throw them away, and never rise upwards from the earth.\\"[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 17th century, Galileo found that, counter to Aristotle's teachings, all objects tend to accelerate equally when falling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relation of the distance of objects in free fall to the square of the time taken was confirmed by Grimaldi and Riccioli between 1640 and 1650. They also made a calculation of the gravitational constant by recording the oscillations of a pendulum.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 17th century, as a result of Robert Hooke's suggestion that there is a gravitational force which depends on the inverse square of the distance,[10] Isaac Newton was able to mathematically derive Kepler's three kinematic laws of planetary motion, including the elliptical orbits for the six then known planets and the Moon:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve, and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them to answer pretty nearly.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Newton's original formula was:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere the symbol \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\propto }\\r\\n\\r\\n means \\"is proportional to\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1907 Albert Einstein, in what was described by him as \\"the happiest thought of my life\\", realized that an observer who is falling from the roof of a house experiences no gravitational field.  In other words, gravitation was exactly equivalent to acceleration.  Between 1911 and 1915 this idea, initially stated as the equivalence principle, was formally developed into Einstein's theory of general relativity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1687, English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton published Principia, which hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation.  In his own words, \\"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier both predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led Johann Gottfried Galle to the discovery of Neptune.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of Mercury could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) have been fruitless.  This issue was resolved in 1915 by Albert Einstein's new general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Dirac developed the hypothesis that gravitation should have slowly and steadily decreased over the course of the history of the universe.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Newton's theory has been superseded, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use it because it is much easier to work with and is sufficiently accurate for most applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mechanical theories or explanations of the gravitation are attempts to explain the law of gravity by aid of basic mechanical processes, such as pushes, and without the use of any action at a distance. These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th century in connection with the aether theories.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nRen Descartes (1644) and Christiaan Huygens (1690) used vortices to explain gravitation.\\r\\nRobert Hooke (1671) and James Challis (1869) assumed, that every body emits waves which lead to an attraction of other bodies.\\r\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier (1690) and Georges-Louis Le Sage (1748) proposed a corpuscular model, using some sort of screening or shadowing mechanism. Later a similar model was created by Hendrik Lorentz, who used electromagnetic radiation instead of the corpuscles.\\r\\nIsaac Newton (1675) and Bernhard Riemann (1853) argued that aether streams carry all bodies to each other.\\r\\nNewton (1717) and Leonhard Euler (1760) proposed a model, in which the aether loses density near the masses, leading to a net force directing to the bodies.\\r\\nLord Kelvin (1871) proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and the electric charges.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, those models were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of drag, which is not observed. Other models are violating the energy conservation law and are incompatible with modern thermodynamics.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of to a force.  The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.  In Newtonian physics, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force (and therefore is not moving inertially).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. (This type of path is called a geodesic).  More specifically, Einstein and Hilbert discovered the field equations of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after Einstein.  The Einstein field equations are a set of 10 simultaneous, non-linear, differential equations.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the metric tensor of spacetime.  A metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because of the way its predictions of phenomena which are not called for by the older theory of gravity have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral decades after the discovery of general relativity it was realized that it cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics.[14] Later it was understood that it is possible to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces. In this framework the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons.[15][16] This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit, but only at the linearized level and postulating that the conditions for the applicability of Ehrenfest theorem holds, which is not always the case. Besides, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is notable that in general relativity, gravitational radiation, which under the rules of quantum mechanics must be composed of gravitons, is created only in situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such as is the case with co-orbiting objects.  The amount of gravitational radiation emitted by the solar system is far too small to measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, gravitational radiation has been observed both indirectly, as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as PSR 1913+16, and directly by the LIGO gravitational wave observatory, whose first detection (named GW150914) occurred on 14 September 2015[17] and matched theoretical predictions of signals due to the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes.  It is believed that neutron star mergers (since detected in 2017)[18] and black hole formation may also create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation.","input":"Who was the first person who discovered gravitational pull?"},{"output":"Mario","context":"Luigi (Japanese: γ, Hepburn: Ruؐji, [??.i?.d?i?]) (English: /lu?i?d?i/; Italian:?[lu?i?d?i]) is a fictional character featured in video games and related media released by Nintendo. Created by prominent game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller fraternal twin brother of Nintendo's mascot Mario, and appears in many games throughout the Mario franchise, often as a sidekick to his brother.\\r\\nLuigi first appeared in the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros. as the character controlled by the second player, and retained this role in Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was Super Mario Bros. 2. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the Mario Party and Mario Kart series, though he has been featured in a starring role on three occasions: first in the 1991 educational game Mario Is Missing!, in Luigi's Mansion for the Nintendo GameCube in 2001, and in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon for the 3DS. In all three of these games, he is called upon to act as the hero because Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three DiC TV series based on the NES and Super NES games.\\r\\nOriginally developed as a palette swap of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the Mario series progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 \\"The Year of Luigi\\" to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, Dr. Luigi, and the level pack New Super Luigi U for New Super Mario Bros U. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of Mario Bros. titled Luigi Bros. was also included with Super Mario 3D World.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events leading to Luigi's creation began in 1982, during the development of Donkey Kong, where the Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario (then known as \\"Jumpman\\") hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games.[1] Miyamoto had been inspired by the game Joust to create a game with a simultaneous two-player mode, which led to his development of the game Mario Bros. in 1983, with Luigi filling the role of Mario's brother as the second playable character.[2] Luigi's name is said to have been inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, called \\"Mario & Luigi's\\".[2] Miyamoto observed that the word ruiji means \\"similar\\" in the Japanese language, and that Luigi was designed to have the same size, shape and gameplay of Mario.[3]\\r\\nWhile Mario was originally portrayed as a carpenter in Donkey Kong, the duo of Mario and Luigi in Mario Bros. were styled as Italian plumbers by Miyamoto, on the suggestion of a colleague.[4] Software constraints of the timesimilar to those that gave Mario his distinctive look in Donkey Kongmeant Luigi's first appearance was restricted to a simple palette swap of Mario designed to represent the second player. Graphically and in terms of gameplay, the characters were completely identical, except for their color schemes;[5] the green color scheme adopted for Luigi would remain one of his defining physical characteristics in subsequent releases.\\r\\nAfter the success of Mario Bros., Luigi was introduced to a wider audience in 1985 with the release of the console game Super Mario Bros. Once again his role was restricted to a palette swap of Mario, functioning as the second-player in a similar fashion to Mario Bros.. The later Japan-only version of Super Mario Bros. 2 in 1986 (later released in the west as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels) marked the beginning of Luigi's development toward becoming a more distinguished character. As with his previous appearances, Luigi remained a palette swap of Mario; however, his movement was no longer identical. Luigi could now jump higher and farther than his brother, at the expense of movement response and precision.[6]\\r\\nWhile this version of Super Mario Bros. 2 was released in Japan, it was deemed to be too difficult for American audiences at the time.[4] In 1988, consequently, an alternative release was developed to serve as Super Mario Bros. 2 for western players (and later released in Japan as Super Mario USA); this version would play a key role in shaping Luigi's current appearance.[4] The game was a conversion of Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic, with the graphics altered to represent characters and scenes from the Mario franchise. In this release, the character of \\"Mama\\", who had the highest jump among the original cast, served as the template for Luigi, resulting in his taller, thinner look, combined with his Marioesque outfit and ubiquitous green color scheme. There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario: in the 1988 Famicom Disk System game Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally and earlier, in a very rare 1986 anime Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! (though in the anime he wore a yellow shirt and the color of his hat and overalls were blue). Promotional artwork for Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World depicts Luigi with this new look; but the actual games would not adapt this different character design in-game until the 1992 game Super Mario Kart. Luigi's distinctive appearance from the Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panic-inspired version of Super Mario Bros. 2 has been used ever since, even for remakes of games in which he was originally a palette swap.\\r\\nMuch like his appearance, Luigi's vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years. In Mario Kart 64, which voiced many characters for the first time, some characters, including Luigi, had two different voices according to the region of the game: North American and European versions feature a low-pitched voice for Luigi, provided by Charles Martinet, who also voices Mario, Wario, Waluigi, and Toadsworth, whereas the Japanese version uses a high-pitched, falsetto voice, provided by (then French translator at Nintendo) Julien Bardakoff. All versions of Mario Party feature Bardakoff's high-pitched clips from Mario Kart 64. Luigi retained this higher voice in Mario Party 2. In Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, and Mario Party 3, his voice returned to a lower state. Since then, with the exceptions of Mario Kart: Super Circuit and Super Smash Bros. Melee, Luigi has consistently had a medium-pitched voice. In Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Luigi's voice was the same high voice from the Japanese Mario Kart 64. In Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee, Luigi's voice is made up of clips from Mario's voice taken from Super Mario 64, with raised pitches. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he has his own voice (which is medium-pitched) instead of a pitched-up version of Mario's.\\r\\nLuigi is portrayed as the taller, younger brother of Mario, and he is usually seen dressed in a green shirt with dark blue overalls.[7] Although Luigi is a plumber,[7] like his brother, other facets of his personality vary from game to game. Luigi always seems nervous and timid but is good-natured and not as quick to anger as his more famous brother. A baby version of the character named Baby Luigi debuted in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, who is held captive by Kamek. He also appeared in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by Charles Martinet, just like his adult self.\\r\\nWhile it has not been made official, Daisy may be Luigi's romantic interest. They were a romantic couple in the Super Mario Bros. film[citation needed] and in Mario Kart Wii they are seen in statue dancing together. She was his caddy in NES Open Tournament Golf[8] as Peach was to Mario. Also on Daisy's trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, it says that she is possibly Luigi's answer to Mario's Peach.[9]\\r\\nNintendo did not initially reveal Luigi's full name. The first notable use of \\"Luigi Mario\\" was in the 1993 live-action film adaptation. In September 2015, at the Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary festival, Miyamoto confirmed Mario's full name was Mario Mario. Consequently, this indirectly confirms Luigi's full name as Luigi Mario.[10][11]\\r\\nLuigi's first appearance was in the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros.[7] as the character controlled by the second player. He retained this role in Wrecking Crew. He later appeared in Super Mario Bros.[7] for the NES, and again in Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, and Super Mario World. Super Mario Bros. 2 introduced Luigi as the taller of the two brothers, as well as the better jumper. Super Mario Bros. 3, and Super Mario World returned to featuring Luigi as a reskinned Mario. He made a minor appearance in his baby form in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. Luigi was conspicuously absent in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. However, the Nintendo DS remake of Super Mario 64 features him as a playable character alongside Mario, Yoshi, and Wario. He received his own starring role in the Nintendo GameCube game Luigi's Mansion, where he wins a mansion from a contest he never entered, and saves Mario from King Boo. Luigi's Mansion has cultivated such a cult following that Nintendo made a sequel to the game nearly a decade after the original game's release date. The sequel is called Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon and is playable on the Nintendo 3DS.[12]\\r\\nLuigi has been associated with the more difficult second acts of multiple Super Mario games.[13] These include The Lost Levels, Super Mario Galaxy 2, New Super Luigi U and the new game plus in Super Mario 3D Land, which offer more challenging elaborations on their respective predecessors and allow the player to use Luigi as the main character, in whom reduced friction and higher jumping is consistent in all of these games. Luigi became playable in the Nintendo DS game New Super Mario Bros. as a hidden character, and as a hidden character in the Wii game Super Mario Galaxy. In its sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, the player can switch out for Luigi throughout the game.[14] He also appears as a playable character in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, where four players can play at once cooperatively as Mario, Luigi, and two Toads. He also appears in Super Mario 3D Land as a playable character as well as New Super Mario Bros. 2 and New Super Mario Bros. U, the latter having a DLC mode, where he is the main character, called New Super Luigi U. It has levels altered to his specific play abilities, including higher jumping. The DLC is also available as a standalone retail version. Luigi also appeared in Super Mario 3D World along with his brother, Peach, Rosalina and Toad.\\r\\nLuigi appears in many of the Mario spin-offs, including Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Mario sports titles. He also appears all four installments of the Super Smash Bros. series; in the first three installments, he is an unlockable character.\\r\\nLuigi has appeared in every Mario role-playing game. While he originally made a cameo appearance in the end credits of Super Mario RPG, he appears more prominently in the Paper Mario series. He is a non-playable character in the original Paper Mario. In the sequel Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, he appears yet again as a non-playable character, going on a separate adventure from Mario's. Super Paper Mario features him as a playable character after he is initially brainwashed into working for the antagonist under the name \\"Mr. L.\\" The Mario & Luigi series features Luigi as a main protagonist; the events of the game focus on him and his brother Mario. He has appeared in all five Mario & Luigi games.\\r\\nLuigi made his animated debut in the 1986 film Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach!. In the film, he was voiced by Y Mizushima and had a different color scheme than he has today, sporting a blue cap, blue overalls, and a yellow shirt. This was because he was not yet given a consistent color scheme. In the film, Luigi was very greedy and even left Mario at one point to look for coins. He was also a little more serious than his brother Mario, who constantly would daydream about Princess Peach, although he is not as brave as Mario.[citation needed]\\r\\nLuigi later made an appearance in the third of a trilogy of OVAs entitled Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros. released in 1989, in which the Mario characters acted out the story of Snow White. He appears at the end of the video to save Mario and Peach from the Wicked Queen, portrayed by Koopa.\\r\\nLuigi regularly appeared in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, airing from 1989 to 1990, which cast Danny Wells as both his live-action portrayal and voice. Like his brother, Luigi's voice actor changed in later cartoons, in his case to Tony Rosato. Even though he was not the starring character in the show, Luigi appeared in all 91 episodes of the three DiC Mario cartoons, in one of which his brother himself did not appear (\\"Life's Ruff\\" from The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3).\\r\\nLuigi played a different role in the Super Mario Bros. film, where he was portrayed by John Leguizamo.[15] He was a more easy-going character in contrast to the cynical Mario, portrayed by Bob Hoskins,[15]) in the film.\\r\\nLuigi has also appeared in several Robot Chicken sketches, always alongside Mario.[citation needed] In one sketch, he and Mario accidentally appear in Vice City, from the Grand Theft Auto series, while another features them competing in a Cannonball Run-styled car race.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2015, game designer Josh Millard released Ennuigi which relates the story of Luigi's inability to come to terms with the lack of narrative in the original Super Mario Bros.[16][17][18] Reception regarding Luigi's character in Ennuigi ranged from \\"depressed,\\"[19] \\"laconic,\\"[20] \\"perpetually miserable,\\"[21] to \\"an angsty teenager who just finished writing a book report about Albert Camus' The Stranger.\\"[17] In a Reddit thread, Millard commented \\"I [...] think it's a pretty weird implied narrative once you step back and look at it, and enjoyed funneling some thoughts about all that into a recharacterization of Luigi as a guy who's as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you'd expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise.\\"[22]\\r\\nOn March 19, 2013, Nintendo began the Year of Luigi. This included a year of Luigi-themed games like Dr. Luigi, Mario & Luigi Dream Team, and New Super Luigi U. A Luigi's Mansion statue was released on Club Nintendo. On March 19, 2014, the Year of Luigi ended.[23]\\r\\nSince his appearance in Super Mario Bros., Luigi has received generally positive reception. Nintendo Power listed Luigi as their fifth favourite hero, citing his dependability while describing him as being an underdog. They also listed him as having one of the best mustaches.[24] GameDaily listed the \\"neglected guy\\" as one of their top 25 video game archetypes, citing Luigi as an example and stating that he lacks the charisma of his brother Mario and that he should get another starring role.[25] They also listed Luigi's Poltergust 3000 from Luigi's Mansion as one of the top 25 Nintendo gimmicks.[26] UGO Networks ranked Luigi at #16 on their \\"25 Most Memorable Italians in Video Games\\" list, ranking him over Mario himself.[27]\\r\\nLuigi has been featured in many \\"Top Sidekicks\\" lists. Machinima placed Luigi as the best sidekick on gaming on their \\"Top 10 Sidekicks in Gaming\\" list.[28] He was also listed as the best sidekick in video games by Maximum PC.[29] IGN ranked him at #2 on their top 10 list, commenting \\"No pair illustrates brotherly love like Mario and Luigi\\".[30] Luigi is also ranked at #2 on ScrewAttack's top 10 list, where they comment that even though he does everything Mario does, he gets none of the glory.[31] WhatCulture listed him at #5 on their top 20 list, adding that a Mario game doesn't seem like a Mario game without Luigi.[32] Maxim listed Luigi as the second most underrated sidekick, behind Waylon Smithers.[33]","input":"Who is the older brother mario or luigi?"},{"output":"Tampa Bay Buccaneers","context":"Ryan Joseph Fitzpatrick[1] (born November 24, 1982) is an American football quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft and has also played for the Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Titans, Houston Texans, and New York Jets.\\r\\nFitzpatrick played college football at Harvard and was the first quarterback in school history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a career.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile a mathematics student at Harvard, Fitzpatrick had five starts during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, working as the backup for Neil Rose. In 2001, he amassed deep passing yards and a pair of touchdowns. He followed that in 2002 by collecting 1,155 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran for five scores and 523 yards that year.\\r\\nFitzpatrick took over the starting job in 2003 following Rose's graduation. Fitzpatrick finished his junior campaign with 1,770 yards, 16 touchdowns and eight interceptions in seven games. Additionally, he ran for 430 yards and six rushing touchdowns, leading his team to a 7ÿ3 record.[3]\\r\\nIn 2004, Fitzpatrick earned Ivy League MVP honors (Asa S. Bushnell Cup), as he accumulated 1,986 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also led Harvard to a 10ÿ0 record, thus winning the Ivy League Championship.[4] He ranked second on the team with 448 rushing yards and five scores.\\r\\nFor his career, Fitzpatrick connected on 384 of 641 passes (59.9 percent) for 5,234 yards, 39 touchdowns and 21 interceptions. He collected 1,487 yards with 16 scores on 365 carries (4.1 avg.) and totaled 6,721 yards, an average of 224.0 yards per game, while seeing action in 30 contests. He ranks second on Harvard's career list for pass completions, touchdowns, yards passing and pass completion percentage, topped only by Neil Rose (5,949 yards, 41 touchdowns, 455 completions, 62.4 percent, 1998ÿ2002). His 641 pass attempts rank fourth in school history. His 1,006 total plays for 6,721 yards in total offense broke the old school career records of 1,005 plays by Mike Giardi (1991ÿ93) and 6,519 yards by Rose.\\r\\nAs is the case for most incoming NFL rookies, Fitzpatrick took the Wonderlic Test. Rumors have indicated that Fitzpatrick recorded a 50 on the test in nine minutes, signifying a perfect score.[5] However, according to a The Wall Street Journal report that appeared in the September 30, 2005, edition, Fitzpatrick scored a 48 on the exam, not a 50still considered an exceptionally high score, but the claim that he completed the test in nine minutes is accurate. While his actual score is unknown, he has acknowledged that he left at least one question blank.[6] As the Wonderlic score is the number of correct answers to 50 questions, the best he could have scored would be a 49. To date, Fitzpatrick has the highest Wonderlic Test score ever achieved among NFL quarterbacks.\\r\\nThe only player to earn a verified perfect score on the Wonderlic test was also a Harvard graduate: wide receiver/punter Pat McInally, who played his entire career with the Cincinnati Bengals.[7]\\r\\nFitzpatrick played his first NFL game on November 27, 2005. Coming into the eleventh game of the regular season in the second quarter against the Houston Texans to replace injured veteran journeyman Jamie Martin, Fitzpatrick led the Rams from a 24ÿ3 halftime deficit to a 33ÿ27 overtime win, throwing for 310 yards and three touchdowns, completing 63.3% of his passes and 117.4 QB rating for the game. This made Fitzpatrick one of only seven players who passed for more 300 yards in their NFL debut. The others were Otto Graham, 346 yards (1950); Ed Rubbert, 334 (a replacement player for the Washington Redskins during the 1987 strike); Mark Rypien, 303 (1988), Peyton Manning, 302 (1998), Cam Newton, 422 (2011), Robert Griffin III, 320 (2012), and Andrew Luck, 309 (2012). The win earned him the next three starts, making Fitzpatrick the first Harvard quarterback to start an NFL game.[9] He was unable to duplicate his debut performance in the games he started with the Rams coming two weeks later in a 13ÿ27 loss to the Minnesota Vikings in which he threw for 235 yards, no touchdowns, and five interceptions for a QB rating of 32.4 for the game. He was replaced by Martin after halftime the following week, after struggling in a home game against the Philadelphia Eagles in which he completed just 41.7% of his passes for a total of 69 yards.[10]\\r\\nOn September 1, 2007, Fitzpatrick was traded to the Bengals for a seventh-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft.[10]\\r\\nA restricted free agent in the 2008 offseason, Fitzpatrick signed his one-year tender offer from the Bengals on April 17. Due to an injury to starting quarterback Carson Palmer, Fitzpatrick made his first Bengals start on September 28, 2008 against the Cleveland Browns. Fitzpatrick was not only the leading passer, but also the leading rusher in the Bengals' 20ÿ12 loss. With Carson Palmer sitting out the game on October 12, 2008, Fitzpatrick got the start against the New York Jets, and every other game that season.\\r\\nDuring the 2008 NFL season, Fitzpatrick ranked third in rushing yards among quarterbacks, finishing behind Tyler Thigpen and David Garrard.[11]\\r\\nFitzpatrick signed with the Buffalo Bills on February 27, 2009 to a 3-year $7.405 million contract.[12] He made his first appearance on October 18, 2009 against the New York Jets when starter Trent Edwards went down with an injury, leading the Bills to a 16ÿ13 overtime win, while throwing for 116 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Fitzpatrick started the following two games, resulting in a win over the Panthers and loss to the Texans.\\r\\nOn November 18, 2009, he was named the starting quarterback of the Buffalo Bills by interim head coach Perry Fewell who took over the coaching duties after former coach Dick Jauron was fired. He went 3ÿ3 as a starter under Fewell, throwing seven touchdowns, six interceptions and 1060 yards. Overall, Fitzpatrick went 5ÿ4 in games in which he had a majority of the playing time for a team that finished with a 6ÿ10 record. In week eleven of the 2009 season in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw a 98-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, the longest touchdown reception and pass for both Owens and Fitzpatrick, also setting the team record for longest touchdown pass. The Bills went on to lose to the Jaguars 18ÿ15.[13]\\r\\nDespite the strong showing, new head coach Chan Gailey decided to go with Trent Edwards as the starter for the 2010 season, relegating Fitzpatrick to the backup role. On September 20, 2010, Fitzpatrick was named the new starting quarterback following the Bills 0ÿ2 start.[14]\\r\\nIn a 49ÿ31 comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals, Fitzpatrick threw for 316 yards and 4 touchdowns, including 3 to Stevie Johnson. This performance marked the first time in NFL history that a team had come back from 17 points down to win by 18 or more.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the second week of the 2011 season, Fitzpatrick led the Bills to touchdown drives on five straight possessions in the second half to rally past the Raiders. It was the first time in league history a team had scored offensive touchdowns on five straight possessions in the second half.[15] In the 2011 season, Fitzpatrick was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September. On October 28, 2011, Fitzpatrick signed a six-year, $59 million contract extension including a $10 million signing bonus with the Bills.[16] He had three 300-yard performances in the 2011 season, with a season high 369 yards vs. the Patriots. After the 2011 season, it was revealed that Fitzpatrick had broken his ribs in a game against the Washington Redskins, which was presumably a factor in his decline in play over the rest of the season. Fitzpatrick finished the 2011 season with 3,832 yards and 24 touchdowns, but threw a league-leading 23 interceptions.\\r\\nFitzpatrick returned as the Bills' starter at the beginning of the 2012 season, but was released on March 12, 2013.[17]\\r\\nOn March 18, 2013, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year contract with the Tennessee Titans.[18] He replaced Jake Locker for the Titans in Week 4 due to an injury in the third quarter. Fitzpatrick completed 3 of his 8 passes for 108 yards, which included a 77-yard TD pass to Nate Washington, in a 38ÿ13 win against the Jets.\\r\\nFitzpatrick played in 11 games and started 9 of them. He finished the season with a 3ÿ6 record as the starting quarterback, beating division rivals the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Houston Texans in the final two games of the season. He completed the season throwing for 2,454 yards with 14 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.\\r\\nFitzpatrick was released on March 14, 2014 and replaced by Charlie Whitehurst.[19]\\r\\nOn March 18, 2014, Fitzpatrick signed a two-year contract with the Houston Texans.[20] He was named the Texans' starting quarterback by new Head Coach Bill O'Brien on June 17,[21] but was demoted to second on the Houston Texans depth chart on November 5, 2014, replaced as starter by Ryan Mallett.\\r\\nOn November 23, 2014 Mallett tore his pectoral muscle and Fitzpatrick was renamed the starter.[22] On November 30, 2014 in a 45ÿ21 win against the Tennessee Titans, Fitzpatrick threw for a franchise-record six touchdowns and 358 yards with no interceptions and a 147.5 passer rating.[23]\\r\\nOn December 14, 2014 during the second quarter against the Indianapolis Colts, Fitzpatrick scrambled for a two-yard gain, was tripped up, and ended up with a fractured tibia, ending his season. He was replaced by rookie Tom Savage, who also received a minor injury, and the Texans lost 10ÿ17.[24] Despite his season-ending injury, Fitzpatrick had a solid season, throwing for 2,483 yards with 17 TDs and 8 INTs for a career-high 95.3 passer rating. He finished the season with a 6ÿ6 record as the starting quarterback for the Texans.\\r\\nOn March 11, 2015, Fitzpatrick was traded by the Houston Texans to the New York Jets for a late-round conditional draft pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.[25][26] The move reunited Fitzpatrick with his former Head Coach Chan Gailey, who was hired during the off-season as the Jets offensive coordinator and play-caller. Following an incident in the locker room, where starting quarterback Geno Smith suffered a broken jaw after being attacked by IK Enemkpali, Fitzpatrick was tentatively named the Week 1 starter for the Jets.[27]\\r\\nMaking his first start for the Jets on September 13, 2015 in Week 1 against the Cleveland Browns, he threw for 179 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception in the 31ÿ10 victory.[28] During Monday Night Football against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 2, Fitzpatrick threw for 244 yards with two touchdowns and an interception as the Jets won 20ÿ7. During Week 3 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick threw for 283 yards with 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions as the Jets lost 17ÿ24. In Week 4 against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium, Fitzpatrick had 218 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception as the Jets won 27ÿ14.[29] In Week 6 against the Washington Redskins, Fitzpatrick rushed for a touchdown on 31 rushing yards and passed for 253 yards with 2 touchdowns and an interception in the 34ÿ20 victory. In Week 7 against the defending Super Bowl champ New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick threw for 295 yards with 2 touchdowns but the Jets lost 23ÿ30. In Week 8 against the Oakland Raiders, Fitzpatrick suffered torn ligaments in his left thumb while scrambling and did not play for the remainder of the game. Geno Smith relieved him for the rest of the game as the Jets would go on to lose 20ÿ34. Fitzpatrick underwent thumb surgery two days later and stated that he would still start.[30] During Week 9 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw for 272 yards with 2 touchdowns as the Jets won 28ÿ23. During Thursday Night Football against the Bills in Week 10, Fitzpatrick threw for 193 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions as the Jets lost 17ÿ22. In Week 11 against the Texans, Fitzpatrick threw for 216 yards with a touchdown and 2 interceptions as the Jets lost 17ÿ24. During a Dolphins rematch in Week 12, Fitzpatrick made his 100th career start by throwing for 277 yards with 4 touchdowns in the 38ÿ20 victory. In Week 13 against the interleague-rival New York Giants, Fitzpatrick threw for 390 yards with 2 touchdowns as the Jets won 23ÿ20 in overtime. In Week 14 against the Titans, Fitzpatrick threw for 263 yards with 3 touchdowns in the 30ÿ8 blowout victory. During Saturday Night Football against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 15, Fitzpatrick threw for 299 yards with a touchdown and an interception in the 19ÿ16 victory. This was Fitzpatrick's 9th win of the season as a starter, securing his first winning season as a starting quarterback.[31] During a Patriots rematch in Week 16, Fitzpatrick threw for 296 yards with 3 touchdowns, including an overtime drive that gave the Jets a game-winning touchdown for a 26-20 victory.[32] In the rematch against the Bills during the season finale in Week 17, Fitzpatrick threw for 181 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he also threw 3 costly interceptions, all of which were in the fourth quarter. The Jets not only lost 17ÿ22, but were also eliminated from playoff contention after the Steelers' win over the Browns, despite finishing the year with a 10ÿ6 record. In 16 starts of the 2015 season, Fitzpatrick finished with his best year as a pro, 3,905 passing yards and 31 passing touchdowns along with 15 interceptions, breaking Vinny Testaverde's 1998 franchise record for most touchdown passes in a season.[33]\\r\\nFitzpatrick, a free agent after the conclusion of the 2015 season, signed a one-year fully guaranteed $12 million contract with the Jets on July 27, 2016.[34]\\r\\nOpening the season against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 1, Fitzpatrick had 189 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception as the Jets lost a close game 22-23.[35] During Thursday Night Football against the Bills in Week 2, Fitzpatrick improved gradually with 374 passing yards and a touchdown, leading the Jets to a 37ÿ31 victory.[36] During Week 3 against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Jets committed 8 turnovers, including Fitzpatrick throwing 6 interceptions. Fitzpatrick finished with 188 passing yards as the Jets lost 24ÿ3.[37] In a week 6 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick was benched in favor of Geno Smith after going 16 for 31 for 174 yard with no touchdowns and one interception and the Jets trailing 28-3. Smith was then named the starter for the next game against the Baltimore Ravens.[38] However, Smith suffered a season-ending injury during the game and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter.[39][40] Fitzpatrick then started the team's next two games against the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins before not playing in the Los Angeles Rams game due to injury.[41] Bryce Petty started in his place even though Fitzpatrick was still active for the game as the backup.[42] Fitzpatrick then returned from his injury to start the next two games against the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts.[41] However, during the Colts game, he was benched in favor of Petty to start the second half.[43] Petty was then named the starter for the final four games of the season. Jets head coach Todd Bowles said, \\"The plan was for us to start him the last four games anyway, so we just started a half early.\\"[44] Petty then started the next three games against the San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots.[45] During the Dolphins game, Fitzpatrick relieved Petty due to injury early in the fourth quarter.[46] Petty also suffered an injury in the Patriots game and was replaced by Fitzpatrick in the second quarter.[47] Due to Petty's injury, Fitzpatrick started the season finale on January 1, 2017, completing 20 of 30 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets beat the Bills by a score of 30-10.[48] In 14 games (11 starts) of 2016, Fitzpatrick finished with 2,710 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and 17 interceptions.\\r\\nOn February 15, 2017, Fitzpatrick's contract was voided and he became a free agent in 2017.[49]\\r\\nOn May 19, 2017, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Fitzpatrick to a one-year, $3 million contract.[50][51][52][53]\\r\\nFitzpatrick is married to Liza Barber.

Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom would constitute a quorum.[1][2] Justices are nominated by the President of the United States and appointed after confirmation by the United States Senate. Justices of the Supreme Court have life tenure[3] and receive a salary which is set at $255,500 per year for the chief justice and at $244,400 per year for each associate justice as of 2014.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court was created in 1789 by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulated that the \\"judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court\\" together with any lower courts Congress may establish.[3] Congress organized the Court that year with the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789. It specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[7][8]\\r\\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members. Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained since.[9]\\r\\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are currently nine justices serving on the Supreme Court; listed in order of seniority, they are:\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 113 persons have served on the Court. Five individuals in this group were confirmed for associate justice, and later confirmed for chief justice separately. While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[11][12]\\r\\nThe graphic below is a timeline depicting the progression of the justices in the Supreme Court of the United States. Information regarding their seat number, predecessors, successors and fellow justices, as well as their tenure on the court can be gleaned from the timeline. Additionally, the progression of presidents (with the number of justices they nominated) is shown at the top of the timeline to give a more detailed historical context. Three presidents (Taft, F. Roosevelt, and Reagan), in addition to successfully nominating several justices to the court, elevated an associate justice to chief justice. These elevations are counted as nominations, and are designated with a caret(^). Several justices began their terms on the bench after the inauguration of a new president of the United States.\\r\\nThis graphical representation of the progression of the High Court allows some otherwise obscure information to be easily noted. For example, Joseph Story (in the early 19th century) and Stephen Breyer (in the late 20th and early 21st centuries) are each noteworthy for serving over 11 years as the court's most junior member. Elena Kagan (in the 2010s) served the third longest as the court's most junior member at a little over 6 years. Thomas Johnson (1790s), Robert Trimble (1820s) and Arthur Goldberg (1960s) are the only justices to leave the court while still being the court's most junior member. William Rehnquist is unique in that he is the only justice to witness all of his more senior justices leave the court, without witnessing any of his more junior justices leave the court. Hugo Black, in addition to witnessing all eight of his predecessors leave the court, saw 22 new members appointed to the court (his predecessors' eight replacements and 14 others), meaning he worked beside a record thirty justices.\\r\\nDue to various changes in the size of the Court over the years, not all ten of this chart's associate justice timelines extend to the present day. \\"Seat 5\\" was last held by James Wayne until his 1867 death, and \\"Seat 7\\" was last held by John Catron until Catron died in 1865.

Y. pestis can reproduce inside cells, so even if phagocytosed, they can still survive. Once in the body, the bacteria can enter the lymphatic system, which drains interstitial fluid. Plague bacteria secrete several toxins, one of which is known to cause beta-adrenergic blockade.[6]\\r\\nY. pestis spreads through the lymphatic vessels of the infected human until it reaches a lymph node, where it causes acute lymphadenitis.[7] The swollen lymph nodes form the characteristic buboes associated with the disease,[8] and autopsies of these buboes have revealed them to be mostly hemorrhagic or necrotic.[9]\\r\\nIf the lymph node is overwhelmed, the infection can pass into the bloodstream, causing secondary septicemic plague and if the lungs are seeded, it can cause secondary pneumonic plague.[10]\\r\\nLymphatics ultimately drain into the bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter the blood and travel to almost any part of the body. In septicemic plague, bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent.[11][12][13] People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe pneumonic form of plague arises from infection of the lungs. It causes coughing and sneezing and thereby produces airborne droplets that contain bacterial cells and are likely to infect anyone inhaling them. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes just a few hours. The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness and spitting or vomiting of blood. The course of the disease is rapid; unless diagnosed and treated soon enough, typically within a few hours, death may follow in one to six days; in untreated cases mortality is nearly 100%.[14][15]\\r\\nTransmission of Y. pestis to an uninfected individual is possible by any of the following means.[16]\\r\\nYersinia pestis circulates in animal reservoirs, particularly in rodents, in the natural foci of infection found on all continents except Australia. The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.[16] Contrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.[17]\\r\\nSince human plague is rare in most parts of the world, routine vaccination is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with enzootic plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western United States. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The CDC thus only recommends vaccination for: (1) all laboratory and field personnel who are working with Y. pestis organisms resistant to antimicrobials; (2) people engaged in aerosol experiments with Y. pestis; and (3) people engaged in field operations in areas with enzootic plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas).[18]\\r\\nA systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found no studies of sufficient quality to make any statement on the efficacy of the vaccine.[19]\\r\\nIf diagnosed in time, the various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, gentamicin and doxycycline have proven effective in monotherapeutic treatment of plague.[20]\\r\\nThe plague bacterium could develop drug-resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995.[21] Further outbreaks in Madagascar were reported in November 2014[22] and October 2017[23].\\r\\nGlobally about 600 cases are reported a year.[2] In 2017 the countries with the most cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru.[2] It has historically occurred in large outbreaks, with the most well known being the Black Death in the 14th century which resulted in greater than 50 million dead.[2]\\r\\nPlague has a long history as a biological weapon. Historical accounts from ancient China and medieval Europe detail the use of infected animal carcasses, such as cows or horses, and human carcasses, by the Xiongnu/Huns, Mongols, Turks and other groups, to contaminate enemy water supplies. Han Dynasty General Huo Qubing is recorded to have died of such a contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by catapult into cities under siege.\\r\\nIn 1347, the Genoese possession of Caffa, a great trade emporium on the Crimean peninsula, came under siege by an army of Mongol warriors of the Golden Horde under the command of Janibeg. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, transferring the plague (Black Death) via their ships into the south of Europe, hence its rapid spread.[24]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Japanese Army developed weaponised plague, based on the breeding and release of large numbers of fleas. During the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, Unit 731 deliberately infected Chinese, Korean and Manchurian civilians and prisoners of war with the plague bacterium. These subjects, termed \\"maruta\\" or \\"logs\\", were then studied by dissection, others by vivisection while still conscious. Members of the unit such as Shiro Ishii were exonerated from the Tokyo tribunal by Douglas MacArthur but 12 of them were prosecuted in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials in 1949 during which some admitted having spread bubonic plague within a 36-km radius around the city of Changde.[25]\\r\\nIshii innovated bombs containing live mice and fleas, with very small explosive loads, to deliver the weaponized microbes, overcoming the problem of the explosive killing the infected animal and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than metal, casing for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.\\r\\nAfter World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union developed means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as diphtheria), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in USSR bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced. Information on many of the Soviet projects is largely unavailable. Aerosolized pneumonic plague remains the most significant threat.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe plague can be easily treated with antibiotics, which some countries, such as the United States, have large supplies on hand if such an attack should occur, thus making the threat less severe.[26]","input":"What was the vector of the bubonic plague?"},{"output":"about 172 million people","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty is a significant issue in India, despite being one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, clocked at a growth rate of 7.11% in 2015, and a sizable consumer economy. The World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions on May 2014 to its poverty calculation methodology and purchasing power parity basis for measuring poverty worldwide. According to this revised methodology, the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line, Nigeria, and Congo is expected to overtake India by the end of 2019. As of 2014, 58% of the total population were living on less than  $3.10 per day.[1] According to the Modified Mixed Reference Period (MMRP) concept proposed by World Bank in 2015, India's poverty rate for period 2011-12 stood at 12.4% of the total population, or about 172 million people; taking the revised poverty line as $1.90.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank has been revising its definition and benchmarks to measure up poverty since 1990, with a $2 per day income on purchasing power parity basis as the definition in use from 2005 to 2013.[5] Some semi-economic and non-economic indices have also been proposed to measure poverty in India; for example, the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index placed 33% weight on number of years spent in school and education and 6.25% weight on financial condition of a person, in order to determine if that a person is poor.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe different definitions and different underlying small sample surveys used to determine poverty in India, have resulted in widely different estimates of poverty from 1950s to 2010s. In 2012, the Indian government stated 22% of its population is below its official poverty limit.[7] The World Bank, in 2011 based on 2005's PPPs International Comparison Program,[8] estimated 23.6% of Indian population, or about 276 million people, lived below $1.25 per day on purchasing power parity.[9][10] According to United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MDG) programme 270 millions or 21.9% people out of 1.2 billion of Indians lived below poverty line of $1.25 in 2011-2012.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom late 19th century through early 20th century, under British colonial rule, poverty in India intensified, peaking in the 1920s.[12][13] Famines and diseases killed millions each time.[14][15] After India gained its independence in 1947, mass deaths from famines were prevented. Rapid economic growth since 1991, has led to sharp reductions in extreme poverties in India.[16][17] However, those above poverty line live a fragile economic life.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per the methodology of the Suresh Tendulkar Committee report, the population below the poverty line in India in 2009-2010 was 354 million (29.6% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 269 million (21.9% of the population).[19] The Rangarajan Committee said in 2014 that the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 454 million (38.2% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 363 million (29.5% of the population).[20] Deutsche Bank Research estimated that there are nearly 300 million people who are middle class.[21] If former trends continue, India's share of world GDP will significantly increase from 7.3% in 2016 to 8.5% by 2020.[22] In 2015, around 170 million people, or 12.4%, lived in poverty (defined as $1.90 (Rs 123.5)), a reduction from 29.8% in 2009.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Asian Development Bank estimates India's population to be at 1.28 billion with an average growth rate, from 2010-2015, at 1.3%. In 2014, 49.9% of the population aged 15 years and above were employed. However, there are still 21.9% of the population who live below the national poverty line.[25]  The World Poverty Clock shows real-time poverty trends in India, which are based on the latest data, of the World Bank, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom November 2017, the World Bank started reporting poverty rates for all countries using two new international poverty lines: a \\"lower middle-income\\" line set at $3.20 per day and an \\"upper middle-income\\" line set at $5.50 per day. India falls in the lower middle-income category. Using the $3.20 per day poverty line, the percentage of the population living in poverty in India was 60% (2011). This means that 763 million people in India were living below this poverty line in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several definitions of poverty, and scholars disagree as to which definition is appropriate for India.[27][28] Inside India, both income-based poverty definition and consumption-based poverty statistics are in use.[29] Outside India, the World Bank and institutions of the United Nations use a broader definition to compare poverty among nations, including India, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), as well as nominal relative basis.[30][31] Each state in India has its own poverty threshold to determine how many people are below its poverty line and to reflect regional economic conditions. These differences in definition yield a complex and conflicting picture about poverty in India, both internally and when compared to other developing countries of the world.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with many countries,[32] poverty was historically defined and estimated in India using a sustenance food standard. This methodology has been revised. India's current official poverty rates are based on its Planning Commission's data derived from so-called Tendulkar methodology.[33] It defines poverty not in terms of annual income, but in terms of consumption or spending per individual over a certain period for a basket of essential goods. Further, this methodology sets different poverty lines for rural and urban areas. Since 2007, India set its official threshold at ? 26 a day ($0.43) in rural areas and about ? 32 per day ($0.53) in urban areas.[34] While these numbers are lower than the World Bank's $1.25 per day income-based definition, the definition is similar to China's US$0.65 per day official poverty line in 2008.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank's international poverty line definition is based on purchasing power parity basis, at $1.25 per day.[36][37] This definition is motivated by the fact that the price of the same goods and services can differ significantly when converted into local currencies around the world. A realistic definition and comparison of poverty must consider these differences in costs of living, or must be on purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. On this basis, currency fluctuations and nominal numbers become less important, the definition is based on the local costs of a basket of essential goods and services that people can purchase. By World Bank's 2014 PPP definition, India's poverty rate is significantly lower than previously believed.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with economic measures, there are many mixed or non-economic measures of poverty and experts contest which one is most appropriate for India. For example, Dandekar and Rath in 1971 suggested a measure of poverty rate that was based on number of calories consumed.[38] In 2011, Alkire et al. suggested a poverty rate measure so-called Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which put only 6.25% weight to assets owned by a person and placed 33% weight on education and number of years spent in school.[6] These non-economic measures remain controversial and contested as a measure of poverty rate of any nation, including India.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia determines household poverty line by summing up the individual per capita poverty lines of the household members. This practice is similar to many developing countries, but different from developed countries such as the United States that adjust poverty line on an incremental basis per additional household member. For example, in the United States, the poverty line for a household with just one member was set at $11,670 per year for 2014, while it was set at $23,850 per year for a 4-member household (or $5963 per person for the larger household).[46] The rationale for the differences arise from the economic realities of each country. In India, households may include surviving grandparents, parents and children. They typically do not incur any or significant rent expenses every month particularly in rural India, unlike housing in mostly urban developed economies. The cost of food and other essentials are shared within the household by its members in both cases. However, a larger portion of a monthly expenditure goes to food in poor households in developing countries,[47] while housing, conveyance and other essentials cost significantly more in developed economies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor its current poverty rate measurements, India calculates two benchmarks. The first includes a basket of goods including food items but does not include the implied value of home, value of any means of conveyance or the economic value of other essentials created, grown or used without a financial transaction, by the members of a household. The second poverty line benchmark adds rent value of residence as well as the cost of conveyance, but nothing else, to the first benchmark.[48] This practice is similar to those used in developed countries for non-cash income equivalents and poverty line basis.[49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's proposed but not yet adopted official poverty line, in 2014, was ?972 (US$14) a month in rural areas or ?1,407 (US$20) a month in cities. The current poverty line is $14 per month ($0.46 per day) in rural areas and $17 per month ($0.56 per day) in urban areas.[51] India's nationwide average poverty line differs from each state's poverty line. For example, in 2011-2012, Puducherry had its highest poverty line of ?1,301 (US$18) a month in rural and ?1,309 (US$18) a month in urban areas, while Odisha had the lowest poverty thresholds of ?695 (US$9.70) a month for rural and ?861 (US$12) a month for its urban areas.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th century and early 20th century saw increasing poverty in India during the colonial era.[12][53] Over this period, the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India, importing these from Britain's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations, while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms, and of agricultural exports from India.[54][55] Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains, such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal,[56] were dedicated to producing poppy and opium, which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China, with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company, and later the colonial British institutions.[57] The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large;[58] by 1850, it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains, led to two opium wars in Asia, with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860. After China accepted opium trade, the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy,[55] the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900, when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation,[59] opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna, and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong, all under exclusive monopoly of the British. By early 20th century, 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture, famines were common, and food consumption per capita declined in every decade.[13] In London, the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India, and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire.[55][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese colonial policies moved unemployed artisans into farming, and transformed India as a region increasingly abundant in land, unskilled labour and low productivity, and scarce in skilled labour, capital and knowledge.[12][13] On an inflation adjusted 1973 Rupee basis, the average income of Indian agrarian labourer was Rs. 7.20 per year in 1885, against an inflation adjusted poverty line of Rs. 23.90 per year. Thus, not only was the average income below poverty line, the intensity of poverty was severe. The intensity of poverty increased from 1885 to 1921, then began a reversal. However, the absolute poverty rates continued to be very high through the 1930s.[12][61] The colonial policies on taxation and its recognition of land ownership claims of zamindars and mansabdars, or Mughal era nobility, made a minority of families wealthy, while it weakened the ability of poorer peasants to command land and credit. The resulting rising landlessness and stagnant real wages intensified poverty.[12][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Planning Committee of 1936 noted the appalling poverty of undivided India.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\n(...) there was lack of food, of clothing, of housing and of every other essential requirement of human existence... the development policy objective should be to get rid of the appalling poverty of the people.\\r\\nThe National Planning Committee, notes Suryanarayana, then defined goals in 1936 to alleviate poverty by setting targets in terms of nutrition (2400 to 2800 calories per adult worker), clothing (30 yards per capita per annum) and housing (100 sq. ft per capita).[63] This method of linking poverty as a function of nutrition, clothing and housing continued in India after it became independent from British colonial empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese poverty alleviation goals were theoretical, with administrative powers resident in the British Empire. Poverty ravaged India. In 1943, for example, despite rising agricultural output in undivided South Asia, the Bengal famine killed millions of Indians from starvation, disease and destitution. Destitution was so intense in Bengal, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Orissa, that entire families and villages were \\"wiped out\\" of existence. Village artisans, along with sustenance farming families, died from lack of food, malnutrition and a wave of diseases.[15] The 1943 famine was not an isolated tragedy. Devastating famines impoverished India every 5 to 8 years in late 19th century and the first half of 20th century. Between 6.1 and 10.3 million people starved to death in British India during the 1876-1879 famine, while another 6.1 to 8.4 million people died during 1896-1898 famine.[64] The Lancet reported 19 million died from starvation and consequences of extreme poverty in British India, between 1896 and 1900.[65] Sir MacDonnell observed the suffering and poverty in 1900, and noted, \\"people died like flies\\" in Bombay.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinhas published his estimates of poverty rates in 1950s India as cyclical and a strong function of each year's harvest. Minhas disagreed with the practice of using calories as the basis for poverty estimation and proposed a poverty line based on real expenditure per year (Rs 240 per annum). In 1956-57, a good harvest year, he computed India's poverty rate to be 65% (215 million people).[67][68] For 1960, Minhas estimated the poverty to be 59%.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Working Group was formed in 1962 to attempt to set a poverty line for India.[70][71] This Working Group used calories required for survival, and income needed to buy those calories in different parts of rural India, to derive an average poverty line of Rs. 20 per month at 1960-61 prices.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of poverty in India during the 1960s varied widely. Dandekar and Rath, on the behalf of then Indian government, estimated that the poverty rate in 1960s remained generally constant at 41%. Ojha, in contrast, estimated that there were 190 million people (44%) in India below official poverty limit in 1961, and that this below-poverty line number increased to 289 million people (70%) in 1967. Bardhan also concluded that Indian poverty rates increased through the 1960s, reaching a high of 54%.[69][73] Those above the 1960s poverty level of Rs 240 per year, were in fragile economic groups as well and not doing well either. Minhas estimated that 95% of India's people lived on Rs 458 per year in 1963-64, while the richest 5% lived on an average of Rs 645 per year (all numbers inflation adjusted to 1960-61 Rupee).[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nDandekar and Rath[74] in 1971 used a daily intake of 2,250 calories per person to define the poverty line for India. Using NSSO data regarding household expenditures for 1960ÿ61, they determined that in order to achieve this food intake and other daily necessities, a rural dweller required an annual income of ? 170.80 per year (? 14.20 per month, adjusted to 1971 Rupee). An urban dweller required ? 271.70 per year (? 22.60 per month). They concluded from this study that 40 percent of rural residents and 50 percent of urban residents were below the poverty line in 1960ÿ61.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty alleviation has been a driver for India's Planning Commission's Task Force on Projections of Minimum Needs and Effective Consumption Demand of the Perspective Planning Division. This division, in 1979, took into account differences in calorie requirements for different age groups, activity levels, and sex. They determined that the average rural dweller needed around 2400 calories, and those in urban areas required about 2100 calories per person per day. To satisfy the food requirement, the Task Force estimated that a consumer spending in 1973ÿ74 of Rs.49.09 per person per month in rural areas and Rs.56.64 in urban areas was appropriate measure to estimate its poverty line.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty remained stubbornly high in India through the 1970s and 1980s. It created slogans such as Garibi Hatao (meaning eliminate poverty) for political campaigns, during elections in early 1970s through the 1980s.[77] Rural poverty rate exceeded 50%, using India's official poverty line for 1970s.[78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Expert Group was instituted in 1993, chaired by Lakdawala, to examine poverty line for India. It recommended that regional economic differences are large enough that poverty lines should be calculated for each state. From then on, a standard list of commodities were drawn up and priced in each state of the nation, using 1973ÿ74 as a base year. This basket of goods could then be re-priced each year and comparisons made between regions. The Government of India began using a modified version of this method of calculating the poverty line in India.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are wide variations in India's poverty estimates for 1990s, in part from differences in the methodology and in the small sample surveys they poll for the underlying data. A 2007 report for example, using data for late 1990s, stated that 77% of Indians lived on less than ? 20 a day (about US$0.50 per day).[81] In contrast, S.G.Datt estimated India's national poverty rate to be 35% in 1994, at India's then official poverty line of Rs 49 per capita, with consumer price index adjusted to June 1974 rural prices.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saxena Committee report, using data from 1972 to 2000, separated calorific intake apart from nominal income in its economic analysis of poverty in India, and then stated that 50% of Indians lived below the poverty line.[82] The Planning Commission of India, in contrast, determined that the poverty rate was 39%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Council of Applied Economic Research estimated that 48% of the Indian households earn more than ?90,000 (US$1,253.40) annually (or more than US$ 3 PPP per person). According to NCAER, in 2009, of the 222 million households in India, the absolutely poor households (annual incomes below ?45,000 (US$630)) accounted for only 15.6% of them or about 35 million (about 200 million Indians). Another 80 million households are in the income levels of ?45,000 (US$630) to ?90,000 (US$1,300) per year. These numbers are similar to World Bank estimates of the \\"below-the-poverty-line\\" households that may total about 100 million (or about 456 million individuals).[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Suresh Tendulkar Committee set up to look into the people living under the poverty line in India submitted its report in November 2009.[84] It provided a new method of calculating the poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure per month or day. For rural areas, it was Rs 816 per month or Rs 27 per day. For urban areas, it was Rs 1000 per month or Rs 33 per day. Using this methodology, the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 354 million (29.6% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 269 million (21.9% of the population).[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its annual report of 2012, the Reserve Bank of India named the state of Goa as having the least poverty of 5.09% while the national average stood at 21.92%[7] The table below presents the poverty statistics for rural, urban and combined percentage below poverty line (BPL) for each State or Union Territory.[7] The highest poverty statistics for each category column is coloured light red in the table below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank has reviewed its poverty definition and calculation methodologies several times over the last 25 years. In early 1990s, The World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and the absolute poverty line was set at $1.08 a day for all countries on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 US dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living.[5] Thereafter, the World Bank determined poverty rates from those living on less than US$1.25 per day on 2005 PPP basis, a measure that has been widely used in media and scholarly circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014, after revisiting its poverty definition, methodology and economic changes around the world, the World Bank proposed another major revision to PPP calculation methodology, international poverty line and indexing it to 2011 US dollar.[26] The new method proposes setting poverty line at $1.78 per day on 2011 PPP basis. According to this revised World Bank methodology, India had 179.6 million people below the new poverty line, China had 137.6 million, and the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line on an equivalent basis as of 2013. India, in other words, while having 17.5% of total world's population, had 20.6% share of world's poor.[10][26] In October 2015, the World Bank updated the international poverty line to US$1.90 a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rangarajan Committee set up to look into the poverty line estimation in India submitted its report in June 2014.[86] It amended the calculation of the poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure per month or day given by the Tendulkar Committee.[87] The new poverty threshold for rural areas was fixed at Rs 972 per month or Rs 32 per day. For urban areas, it was fixed at Rs 1407 per month or Rs 47 per day. Under this methodology, the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 454 million (38.2% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 363 million (29.5% of the population).[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom November 2017, the World Bank started reporting poverty rates for all countries using two new international poverty lines: a \\"lower middle-income\\" line set at $3.20 per day and an \\"upper middle-income\\" line set at $5.50 per day. These are in addition to the earlier poverty line of $1.90 per day. The new lines are supposed to serve two purposes. One, they account for the fact that achieving the same set of capabilities may need a different set of goods and services in different countries and, specifically, a costlier set in richer countries. Second, they allow for cross-country comparisons and benchmarking both within and across developing regions. India falls in the lower middle-income category. Using the $3.20 per day poverty line, the percentage of the population living in poverty in India (2011) was 60%. This means that 763 million people in India were living below this poverty line in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther measures such as the semi-economic Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which places 33% weight on education and number of schooling years in its definition of poverty, and places 6.25% weight on income and assets owned, suggests there were 650 million people (53.7% of population) living in MPI-poverty in India.[6] 421 million of MPI-defined poor are concentrated in eight North Indian and East Indian states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The table below presents this semi-economic poverty among the states of India based on the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, using a small sample survey data for Indian states in 2005.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2011 poverty Development Goals Report, as many as 320 million people in India and China are expected to come out of extreme poverty in the next four years, with India's poverty rate projected to drop from 51% in 1990 to about 22% in 2015.[90] The report also indicates that in Southern Asia, only India is on track to cut poverty by half by the 2015 target date.[90]\\r\\nIn 2015, according to United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MGD) programme, India has already achieved the target of reducing poverty by half, with 24.7% of its 1.2 billion people in 2011 living below the poverty line or having income of less than $1.25 a day, the U.N. report said. The same figure was 49.4% in 1994. India had set a target of 23.9% to be achieved by 2015.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Global Wealth Report 2016[92] compiled by Credit Suisse Research Institute, India is the second most unequal country in the world with the top one per cent of the population owning 58% of the total wealth.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal Hunger Index (GHI) is an index that places a third of weight on proportion of the population that is estimated to be undernourished, a third on the estimated prevalence of low body weight to height ratio in children younger than five, and remaining third weight on the proportion of children dying before the age of five for any reason. According to 2011 GHI report, India has improved its performance by 22% in 20 years, from 30.4 to 23.7 over 1990 to 2011 period.[94] However, its performance from 2001 to 2011 has shown little progress, with just 3% improvement. A sharp reduction in the percentage of underweight children has helped India improve its hunger record on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2014. India now ranks 55 among 76 emerging economies. Between 2005 and 2014, the prevalence of underweight children under the age of five fell from 43.5% to 30.7%.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty: 2011-2012 Percentage of people by Caste[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nFindings below are based on a survey conducted during 2011-12.\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal population of India 1,276,267,631\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty in India based on caste.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty in India based on Social and Religious Classes.\\r\\nThe Sachar Committee looked at the Poverty by Social and Religious Classes[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject of the economic impact of British imperialism on India remains contentious. The issue was raised by British Whig politician Edmund Burke who in 1778 began a seven-year impeachment trial against Warren Hastings and the East India Company on charges including mismanagement of the Indian economy. Contemporary historian Rajat Kanta Ray argues the economy established by the British in the 18th century was a form of plunder and a catastrophe for the traditional economy of Mughal India, depleting food and money stocks and imposing high taxes that helped cause the famine of 1770, which killed a third of the people of Bengal.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1950s, the Indian government and non-governmental organisations have initiated several programs to alleviate poverty, including subsidising food and other necessities, increased access to loans, improving agricultural techniques and price supports,  promoting education and family planning. These measures have helped eliminate famines, cut absolute poverty levels by more than half, and reduced illiteracy and malnutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades, its growth has been uneven when comparing social groups, economic groups, geographic regions, and rural and urban areas.[99][100] For the year 2015-16, the GSDP growth rates of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh was higher than Maharashtra, Odisha or Punjab.[101] Though, GDP growth rate matters a lot economically, however, the debate is moving towards another consensus in India where unhealthy infatuation with GDP growth matters less and holistic development or all inclusive growth matters more.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite significant economic progress, one quarter of the nation's population earns less than the government-specified poverty threshold of ?32  per day (approximately US$ 0.6).[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 2001 census, 35.5% of Indian households used banking services, 35.1% owned a radio or transistor, 31.6% a television, 9.1% a phone, 43.7% a bicycle, 11.7% a scooter, motorcycle or a moped, and 2.5% a car, jeep or van; 34.5% of the households had none of these assets.[104] According to Department of Telecommunications of India the phone density reached 73.34% by December 2012 and as an annual growth decreased by ?4.58%.[105] This tallies with the fact that a family of four with an annual income of ?137,000 (US$1,900) could afford some of these luxury items.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank's Global Monitoring Report for 2014-15 on the Millennium Development Goals says India has been the biggest contributor to poverty reduction between 2008 and 2011, with around 140 million or so lifted out of absolute poverty.[106]\\r\\nSince the early 1950s, Indian government initiated various schemes to help the poor attain self-sufficiency in food production. These have included ration cards and price controls over the supply of basic commodities, particularly food at controlled prices, available throughout the country. These efforts prevented famines, but did little to eliminate or reduce poverty in rural or urban areas between 1950 and 1980.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main reasons for record decline in poverty is India's rapid economic growth rate since 1991.[16][17][108] Another reason proposed is India's launch of social welfare programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the Midday Meal Scheme in government schools.[citation needed] Klonner and Oldiges, in a 2012 study, conclude that MGNREGA helps reduce rural poverty gap (intensity of rural poverty) and seasonal poverty, but not overall poverty.[109][110] However, there is a disturbing side, as deprivation has tended to increase, and that too among the most deprived sections. According to the latest statistics published by the Census of India, among scheduled tribes 44.7% of people were farmers working on their own land in 2001; however, this number came down to 34.5% in 2011. Among scheduled castes this number declined from 20% to 14.8% during the same period. This data is corroborated by other data from the census, according to which the number of people who were working not on their own land but on others' land (landless laborers), increased from 36.9% in 2001 to 44.4% among scheduled castes SC and from 45.6% to 45.9% among scheduled tribes.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic and socio-economic","input":"How much population is below poverty line in india?"},{"output":"seven seasons","context":"True Blood is an American dark fantasy horror television series produced and created by Alan Ball and based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries, a series of novels by Charlaine Harris.\\r\\nThe series revolves around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic waitress living in the rural town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, two years after the invention of a synthetic blood that has allowed vampires to \\"come out of the coffin\\" and allow their presence to be known to mankind. Now they are struggling for equal rights and assimilation, while anti-vampire organizations begin to gain power. Sookie's world is turned upside down when she falls in love with 173-year-old vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer) and for the first time must navigate the trials, tribulations and terrors of intimacy and relationships.[1][2]\\r\\nThe show was broadcast on the premium cable network HBO, in the United States, and was produced by HBO in association with Ball's production company, Your Face Goes Here Entertainment.[1] The series premiered on September 7, 2008 and concluded on August 24, 2014, comprising seven seasons and 80 episodes.[3][4] The first five seasons received highly positive reviews, and both nominations and wins for several awards, including a Golden Globe and an Emmy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fictional universe depicted in the series is premised on the notion that vampires exist, unbeknownst to the majority of humans until two years before the series premiere, when the creation of synthetic blood (\\"Tru Blood\\") by Japanese scientists, which eliminated vampires' need for human blood to survive, allowed vampires to \\"come out of the coffin\\" and reveal their existence to the world.E-1 This so-called \\"Great Revelation\\" has split vampires into two camps: those who wish to integrate into human society (i.e., \\"mainstream\\") by campaigning for citizenship and equal rights,E-1 and those who think human-vampire co-existence is impossible, because it conflicts with the inherently predatory and violent nature of vampires. It has also caused similar divisions amongst non-vampires; some believe that they should be accepted and granted rights, while others view them as monsters to be destroyed. Throughout the series, other supernatural creatures are introduced, among them shapeshifters, werewolves, faeries, witches, and a maenad.\\r\\nThe series revolves around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic human-faerie hybrid known as a halfling (not to be confused with similarly named, but unrelated creatures found in other fantasy works). Sookie is a waitress at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps. Sam is a shapeshifter, though this secret is kept hidden from most of the town. Other characters include Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a 173-year-old vampire who has returned to Bon Temps to take up residence in his former home following the death of his last remaining relative; Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's tough-talking but insecure best friend; Jason (Ryan Kwanten), Sookie's womanizing brother; Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsg?rd), a 1000-year-old vampire and Sheriff of Area 5; and Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), a short order cook, drug dealer, road crew member, and medium.\\r\\nThe show explores several contemporary issues such as the struggle for equal rights, discrimination and violence against minorities and homosexuals, the problems of drug addiction, the power of faith and religion, the control/influence of the media, the quest for identity, and the importance of family.\\r\\nSeries creator Alan Ball had previously worked with the cable channel HBO on Six Feet Under, which ran for five seasons. In October 2005, after Six Feet Under wrapped, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. True Blood became the first project under the deal, after Ball became acquainted with Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery books.[5] One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a Barnes & Noble bookshop and came across Dead Until Dark (2001), the first installment in Harris' series. He read the entries that followed and became interested in \\"bringing [Harris'] vision to television\\".[5][6] However, Harris already had two other adaptation options for the books. She said she chose to work with him, though, because \\"[Ball] really 'got' me. That's how he convinced me to go with him. I just felt that he understood what I was doing with the books.\\"\\r\\nThe project's hour-long pilot was ordered concurrently with the finalization of the aforementioned development deal, and was written, directed, and produced by Ball.[1][5] Cast members Paquin, Kwanten and Trammell were announced in February 2007 and Moyer later on in April.[7][8] The pilot was shot in the early summer of 2007 and was officially ordered to series in August, at which point Ball had already written several more episodes.[1] Production on the series began later that fall,[9] with Brook Kerr, who portrayed Tara Thornton in the original pilot, replaced by Rutina Wesley.[10] Two more episodes of the series had been filmed before the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike shut down production of the 12-episode first season until February of 2008.[11] That September, after only the first two episodes of the series had aired, HBO placed an order for a second season of 12 episodes, with production scheduled to commence in January 2009 for a summer premiere.[12]\\r\\nTrue Blood's Emmy-nominated title sequence is composed of portrayals of the show's Deep South setting, and runs to \\"Bad Things\\" by Jace Everett, although the original featurette was created around the Jennifer Herrema (Royal Trux) song \\"RadTimesXpress\\".[13]\\r\\nConceptually, the sequence was constructed around the idea of \\"the whore in the house of prayer\\"[14] by intermingling contradictory images of sex, violence, and religion and displaying them from the point of view of \\"a supernatural, predatory creature observing human beings from the shadows ...\\"[13] Ideas of redemption and forgiveness are also explored, and thus the sequence progresses from morning to night and culminates in a baptism.[14]\\r\\nThe title sequence was created by the independent film company Digital Kitchen. The sequence also features images and themes of death and rebirth; the circle of life. A Venus fly-trap can be seen engulfing a frog, while a rotting fox's head is sped up to reveal maggots feeding off the corpse. Rebirth is also recognized through an image of a woman being \\"washed clean\\" from her sins in a lake, as well as a Reverend blessing and possibly performing an exorcism on a member of his congregation.[15]\\r\\nSome of the footage used in the sequence was filmed on location. Digital Kitchen then took a four-day trip to Louisiana to film as well as shot at a Chicago church, and on a stage and in a bar in Seattle.[14]\\r\\nIn editing the opening, individual frames were splattered with drops of blood.[14] The sequence's transitions were constructed differently, though; they were made with a Polaroid transfer technique. The last frame of one shot and the first frame of another were taken as a single Polaroid photo, which was then divided between emulsion and backing. The emulsion was then filmed being further separated by chemicals, and those shots of this separation were placed back into the final edit.[13]\\r\\nEight different typefaces, inspired by Southern road signs, were also created manually for cast and crew credits, as well as the show's title card.[14]\\r\\nIn a 2010 issue of TV Guide, the show's opening title sequence ranked #5 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.[16]\\r\\nGary Calamar, who supervises the series' music, said his goal for the show's soundtrack is to create something \\"swampy, bluesy and spooky\\" and to feature local Louisiana musicians.[17] True Blood soundtrack albums have twice earned Grammy Award nominations.\\r\\nComposer Nathan Barr writes the original score for the series, which features the cello, guitar, prepared piano, and glass harmonica among other instruments, all of which he performs himself.[18] The main theme song is \\"Bad Things\\" by country music artist Jace Everett, from his 2005 self-titled debut.[19]\\r\\nElektra/Atlantic Records released a True Blood soundtrack on May 19, 2009, the same day as the release of the DVD and Blu-ray of the first season.[20] Nathan Barr's original score for True Blood was released on CD on the Varse Sarabande label on September 8, 2009.[21] The second True Blood soundtrack was released on May 25, 2010, to coincide with the third season's premiere in June. The third volume was released on September 6, 2011, a few days before the season four finale.[22]\\r\\nBoth Nathan Barr and Jace Everett won 2009 awards from Broadcast Music Incorporated in the BMI Cable Awards category for, respectively, True Blood's original score and theme song.[23]\\r\\nThe show's individual episode titles are named after songs featured in the episodes, usually heard during the closing credits. The title usually indicates something about the events that will unfold throughout the given episode. For example, episode ten of season four is titled \\"Burning Down the House\\", and the end credits feature a cover version of the classic Talking Heads song performed by The Used.\\r\\nThe premiere of True Blood was prefaced with a viral marketing/alternate reality game (ARG) campaign, based at BloodCopy.com, throughout the summer.[24] This included setting up multiple websites,[25][26][27] encoding web address into unmarked envelopes mailed to high-profile blog writers and others, and even performances by a \\"vampire\\" who attempted to reach out to others of their kind, to discuss the recent creation of \\"TrueBlood\\", a fictional beverage featured in the show. A MySpace account with the username \\"Blood\\"[28] had, as of June 19, uploaded two videos;[29] one entitled \\"Vampire Taste Test ÿ True Blood vs Human\\",[30] and one called \\"BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE\\".\\r\\nA prequel comic was handed out to attendees of the 2008 Comic-Con. The comic centers around an old vampire named Lamar, who tells the reader about how TruBlood surfaced and was discussed between many vampires before going public. At one point, Lamar wonders if TruBlood is making the world safe for vampires or from them. Several commercials featured on HBO and Facebook[31] aired prior to the series premiere, placing vampires in ads similar to those of beer and wine. Some beverage vending machines across the US were also fitted with cards indicating they were \\"sold out\\" of TruBlood.\\r\\nHBO produced and broadcast two documentaries to promote True Blood, entitled \\"True Bloodlines\\".[32] The first, Vampire Legends, explored the earliest portrayals of vampires in legend, literature, and cinema. The second, A New Type, discusses vampire culture from Nosferatu to today's sensual, sexual creatures. To that end, the show also covered the modern vampire subculture and real-life vampire clubs.[33] Actors and writers from True Blood appeared in the documentaries. The shows first aired on September 6, 2008, on HBO.\\r\\nThousands of DVDs of the first episode were handed out to attendees of Midnight Madness, a special film festival. Blockbuster Video provided free rental of the first episode of True Blood several days before it was broadcast on HBO. The video had a faint promotional watermark throughout the episode.\\r\\nOn April 16, 2009, HBO released the first teaser poster for Season 2. The image uses a perspective technique that shows observers one of two images.[34] A minute-long promotional video advertising season two, which featured Bob Dylan's \\"Beyond Here Lies Nothin'\\", was released via Entertainment Tonight in early May.[35]\\r\\nOn September 19, 2009, HBO.com began selling Tru:Blood,[36] a beverage branded to resemble the fictional synthetic blood that appears in the show. The beverage is a carbonated blood orange-flavored drink, developed and manufactured by Omni Consumer Products, a company that specializes in defictionalizing brands from television and movies, and FMCG Manufacturing Company, a specialist manufacturer of licensed entertainment products.\\r\\nThere is also a website for The Fellowship of the Sun,[37] antagonists from the book series, featuring videos about hot-button issues such as becoming a vampire.\\r\\nFX, available in the UK, launched an extensive promotional website for the series.[38]\\r\\nOn September 15, 2009, HBO filed a trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a possible future electronic game based on True Blood.[39]\\r\\nOn September 18, 2009, HBO launched a True Blood jewelry line in collaboration with New York-based designer Udi Behr. Inspired by the series, the jewelry has a Gothic look and features sterling silver, polished steel, and rubies.[40]\\r\\nOn June 1, 2010, HBO held a special event at a number of movie theaters around the U.S.,[41] complete with red carpet, searchlights and swag bags. Contest winners were invited to watch a special live, the Season 2 finale, a preview of Season 3, and a live interview on the set of True Blood with the cast and Alan Ball.\\r\\nHBO began selling True Blood figural busts featuring Bill, Sookie, and Eric in summer 2010. Busts of other characters will also be available later.\\r\\nHBO and IDW Publishing announced at the 2010 WonderCon that they would be publishing a comic book based on the series.[42] Alan Ball developed and wrote the comic. The first booklet, with a print run of 53,000, was released in July 2010[43] and soon sold out. The second issue went on sale August 18, 2010, with a second printing of the first issue going on sale August 25.[44]\\r\\nSix comics were issued in the series, and they were compiled as the graphic novel All Together Now on February 15, 2011. This was the first in a series of four graphic novels released by HBO under the True Blood franchise and sold in major bookstores.[45] Ensuing titles include Tainted Love, The French Quarter, and Ongoing.\\r\\nTrue Blood employs a broad ensemble cast composed of regular, central characters and a rotating group of impermanent supporting characters. Though the series is based in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a noticeable number of the actors comprising the cast are originally from outside the United States. In an interview, Ball explained that he didn't intentionally seek out \\"non-American\\" actors, but was willing to go anywhere he needed to in order \\"to find the actor who makes the character breathe\\". Ball went on to explain that, in casting, there was more of a focus on who would portray the character in a compelling way rather than who would physically resemble the characters from the book. Noting that there's a definite difference between the characters and storylines portrayed in True Blood and the ones depicted in The Southern Vampire Mysteries, he described Harris as being very understanding in terms of how her work was being reinterpreted.[46]\\r\\nThe major characters of the first season of True Blood are introduced among various intertwining plot lines that surround the Bon Temps bar \\"Merlotte's\\". The show's main protagonist, Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), is a telepath and waitress at Merlotte's.E-1 In the opening episode she saves Merlotte's first vampire customer, Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), when a local couple attempts to drain him of his blood (vampire blood is known on the show as a human narcotic: \\"V\\" or \\"V Juice\\").E-1 Through the relationship that develops between Sookie and Bill, the viewer progressively learns more about vampire culture and the limitations of vampire physiology (e.g. susceptibility to silver and the sun).\\r\\nThe major plot of the first season revolves around the murder of several women connected to Sookie's older brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten).E-1 The women murdered include sexual partner Maudette Pickens (Danielle Sapia),E-1 on-and-off romantic interest and Merlotte's waitress Dawn Green (Lynn Collins),E-3 grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) or simply \\"Gran\\",E-5 and girlfriend Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan).E-11 Though the viewer is always aware of Jason's innocence in their deaths, Detective Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) targets him as the prime suspect in the investigation he conducts with Sheriff Bud Dearborne (William Sanderson) to identify their killer.E-1 Jason's best friends and co-workers, Hoyt Fortenberry (Jim Parrack) and Rene Lenier (Michael Raymond-James) provide him with support despite the turmoil he encounters.E-1 Rene, who becomes engaged to Merlotte's waitress Arlene Fowler (Carrie Preston),E-8 is eventually exposed as the Bon Temps murderer and is killed in a final confrontation with Sookie.E-12\\r\\nA secondary plot in the first season (that later develops as the primary storyline in the second) revolves around Sookie's best friend Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley).E-1 In the first episode, Tara is hired as a bartender at Merlotte's by bar owner, shapeshifter,E-11 and admirer of Sookie, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell),E-1 with whom Tara later has a brief relationship.E-3 Tara's cousin Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis) already works as a cook at Merlotte'sE-1 (in addition to several other jobs that include road crew, prostitute, and drug dealer)E-3 with Andy's cousin and Iraq War veteran, Terry (Todd Lowe).E-2 Tara's story is characterized by her relationship with her alcoholic and abusive mother Lettie Mae (Adina Porter)E-2 and her own inner \\"demons\\".E-10 During the season, Lettie Mae achieves sobrietyE-8 but Tara's life begins to spin out of control. Kicked out of her home and totaling her car in a drunk driving accident,E-10 she's taken in by \\"social worker\\" Maryann Forrester (Michelle Forbes).E-11 While staying with Maryann, Tara is introduced to \\"Eggs\\" Benedict Talley (Mehcad Brooks), to whom she becomes attracted.E-11\\r\\nThe final major plotline of the first season revolves around the elements of vampire society that Sookie and Bill's relationship introduce. While trying to prove her brother's innocence in relation to Maudette and Dawn's murders, Bill takes Sookie to the vampire bar \\"Fangtasia\\" to investigate. There, Sookie is introduced to Fangtasia's owner and the vampire sheriff of \\"Area 5\\" in Louisiana: Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsg?rd).E-4 Eric is immediately interested in Sookie and her strange abilities, but his progeny and assistant Pam (Kristin Bauer) is less impressed.E-4 Eric employs Sookie to find a thief in his bar, but the perpetrator (a vampire named Longshadow) attempts to kill Sookie when she reveals his identity. Bill stakes and kills the thief to save her, but has committed a serious crime in killing another vampire.E-8 When Bill is tried for his crime, his punishment is to transform seventeen-year-old Jessica Hamby (Deborah Ann Woll) into a vampire to replace the one he destroyed.E-10\\r\\nA secondary plotline introduced in the first season (which later becomes a main plotline in Season 2) is that although many humans are attracted to vampires (referred to as \\"fang bangers\\") and flock to establishments like Fangtasia, not all people are accepting of the idea that vampires should be given rights equal to those afforded the mortals of the True Blood universe. During the first season, one of the ways in which anti-vampire sentiment is expressed is through regular televised appearances by the \\"Fellowship of the Sun\\",E-2 a Dallas-based church that in Season 2 becomes headed by the Reverend Steve Newlin (Michael McMillian)E-3 after his father and family are killed in a strange \\"accident\\".E-2\\r\\nDuring the second season of True Blood, the influence of Maryann Forrester and the conflict between vampires and humans is expanded. Most of the cast from the first season returns and several new main characters are introduced. The same style of interconnected story telling used in the first season is repeated, with the foremost plot focusing on Maryann Forrester being revealed as a maenadE-19 with the power to influence humans.E-15 She begins by manipulating Tara and Eggs to achieve her goal of summoning her god to earth,E-20 and eventually takes control of almost the entire population of Bon Temps.E-22\\r\\nWhile Maryann begins establishing her hold on Bon Temps, Sookie is recruited by EricE-15 to investigate the disappearance of his two-thousand-year-old maker and the Sheriff of Area 9 in Texas: Godric (Allan Hyde).E-17 While Sookie is absent from Bon Temps, Sam hires Daphne Landry (Ashley Jones) to join Merlotte's staff.E-13 Daphne (who is revealed to also be a shapeshifterE-17) begins a romance with Sam,E-16 but is later exposed as working for Maryann.E-18 Jason also leaves Bon Temps for Dallas to join the Fellowship of the Sun,E-14 which Reverend Newlin has steered in a new militant direction despite the protestations of his wife Sarah (Anna Camp).E-13 Godric is discovered in the custody of the Fellowship,E-17 and one of Godric's lieutenants, Isabel Beaumont (Valerie Cruz),E-17 sends her human boyfriend Hugo (Christopher Gartin)E-18 to assist Sookie in infiltrating the church. Though Eric's primary interest in Dallas is finding Godric, he also attempts to place himself between Sookie and Bill. To accomplish this, he enlists the aid of Bill's maker Lorena (Mariana Klaveno);E-17, who thus becomes a more prominent contribution to the cast after a brief introduction in the first season.E-5 In the penultimate episode of the second season, once the conflict in Texas is concluded, the vampire queen of Louisiana Sophie-Anne Leclerq (Evan Rachel Wood) is introduced.E-23 Both Bill and Eric visit her in an attempt to find out how to defeat Maryann.E-23 Bill uses the information provided by Sophie-Anne to devise a plan involving Sam and Sookie, and the three manage to kill Maryann in the season two finale. Subsequently, Bill takes Sookie out to an exclusive French restaurant to propose to her. However, before she can give her answer, Bill is kidnapped.\\r\\nSeason three picks up straight after the events of season two with Sookie on the hunt to track down Bill and his kidnappers. She turns to Eric for help, who is not interested (seeing this turn of events as a chance to get Sookie for himself), but he ends up sending werewolf Alcide Herveaux (Joe Manganiello) for assistance after it is revealed that Bill was taken by V-addicted werewolves in the employ of the 3000-year-old vampire king of Mississippi, Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare). Meanwhile, back in Bon Temps, Lafayette embarks on a relationship with his mother's care nurse and brujo Jes~s Velasquez (Kevin Alejandro) and learns about his own special powers as a medium, while Sam hires a new waitress at Merlotte's, Wiccan Holly Cleary (Lauren Bowles).\\r\\nIn season 4, Jessica Tuck (Nan Flanagan) and Janina Gavankar (Luna) became season regulars. Alexandra Breckenridge (Kate) and Vedette Lim (Naomi) became recurring actresses.[47]\\r\\nJoining the cast for season five was Christopher Meloni, who previously starred on another of HBO's own original series Oz as well as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for 12 years. Details on his character have yet to be released.[48] Also joining the cast is Scott Foley as Patrick, Terry's old war buddy,[49] Louis Herthum as JD, Kelly Overton as Rikki, a new werewolf curious how Marcus died,[50] Carolyn Hennesy is expected to be Rosalyn Harris, a Texas vampire with twang,[51] and Jacob Hopkins will play child vampire Chancellor Alexander Drew.[52]\\r\\nFor season six, it was announced that Robert Kazinsky would join the principal cast as Ben, a faerie and a potential love interest for Sookie. He will also help Sookie and Jason discover the truth about their parents' murders.[53] Robert Patrick, who guest starred in season five as Jackson Herveaux, was promoted to series regular for season six.[54] Rutger Hauer, who starred in popular films such as Blade Runner and Batman Begins, was announced as a series regular playing \\"Macklyn\\", a character with \\"strong ties to Sookie and Jason\\".[55]\\r\\nAs reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Adina Porter would be returning for the seventh season as a series regular after being credited as a Special Guest Star since season two. Also upgraded to regulars are season six guest stars Amelia Rose Blaire as Willa Burrell, Bailey Noble as Adilyn Bellefleur, Luke Grimes as James and Karolina Wydra as Violet Mazurski.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main mystery of the first season concerns the murders of women connected to Sookie's brother, Jason. Maudette Pickens and Dawn Green are both strangled shortly after having been alone with him. Though Detective Bellefleur has little doubt that Jason is the killer, the town sheriff does not suspect him. Sookie's grandmother is murdered shortly afterward. After the murders, Jason becomes addicted to vampire blood and has a short relationship with another addict, Amy Burley, which ends when she is murdered as well. The season also focuses on Sookie's relationship with Bill and Sam's relationship with Sookie's friend Tara. Bill explains the rules of being a vampire to Sookie and, after killing a vampire to defend her, is forced to \\"turn\\" a young girl named Jessica into a vampire as punishment. The immature Jessica is left under Bill's care and starts to grow up both as a vampire and as a person. In the end it is revealed that Arlene Fowler's fianc, Rene Lenier, has been killing women who associate with vampires. Further, he is actually a man named Drew Marshall who created a false identity, complete with a fake Cajun accent. The season ends with the discovery of a body in Detective Andy Bellefleur's car in Merlotte's parking lot.\\r\\nThe second season loosely follows the plot of the second novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, Living Dead in Dallas. In addition, the character of Sophie-Anne Leclerq, initially introduced in the sixth novel Definitely Dead, was introduced as a major supporting character. The main theme of the season involves the disappearance of Godric, the 2,000-year-old vampire Sheriff of Area 9. Eric enlists Sookie and Bill's aid in finding the ancient vampire in Dallas. Their paths cross Jason's as he seeks to discover meaning in his life with the Fellowship of the Sun, a church dedicated to anti-vampire activities. A second theme concerns a maenad named Maryann who visits Bon Temps after Tara attracts her attention at the end of the first season. Maryann is a figure from Sam's past and knows his true identity as a shapeshifter. Her influence on the town and its residents results in mayhem that grows more destructive as the season progresses. At the end of the season, Bill proposes to Sookie, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants when Sookie retreats to the bathroom to consider his proposal.\\r\\nSeason three loosely follows the plot of the third novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, Club Dead, and introduces werewolves to the show's mythology. It also introduces the characters of Russell Edgington, the Vampire King of Mississippi, and his private investigator, Franklin Mott. In addition, some characters from the fourth novel Dead to the World are introduced: Crystal Norris as Jason's love interest, her family of werepanthers from Hotshot, and Sookie's \\"faerie godmother\\", Claudine. Sookie's heritage as part faerie is also revealed later in the season, a major plot element from the eighth and ninth novels From Dead to Worse and Dead and Gone. This season ends with Jason left to take care of Hotshot, Tara leaving Bon Temps, Bill fighting the queen, Sam shooting Tommy, and Hoyt and Jessica moving in together. The final cliffhanger involves Claudine taking Sookie away to the land of Faerie.\\r\\nA coven of witches, led by Marnie, poses a threat to vampires when they discover the witches are working on necromancy. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a year (even though for her she was away for only a few minutes in Faerie) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had given up hope of finding her. As the series progresses, a powerful necromancer from the 16th century, Antonia, possesses the body of Marnie in order to exact revenge on all vampires. Sookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia/Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Lafayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Sam's family troubles, Alcide and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Jason, Hoyt and Jessica's love triangle. The finale is a series of cliffhangers, including a warning from the ghost of Rene that Terry will cause Arlene trouble, the escape of Russell Edgington, the reappearance of Steve Newlin as a vampire, and the shooting of Tara.\\r\\nThe season follows Bill and Eric being captured by the Vampire Authority after the disappearance of Nan Flanagan. The two are almost sentenced to death by the Guardian, Roman, before revealing that Russell Edgington is alive and free after being released by a mysterious vampire. With the help of Sookie the team discovers his hiding place and brings him in. Alcide deals with his troubled rise to pack-master, and Terry learns he is death-cursed after committing a terrible crime during the war in Iraq. Meanwhile, Sookie learns that her powers are limited and contemplates having a normal life, just as Tara learns to deal with her newly given life as Pam's progeny. Jason and Sookie discover their parents were murdered by a vampire and vow to find out who is responsible. Hoyt gets involved with a hate group, then decides to leave for Alaska, just as Andy heads towards life as family man, and Lafayette tries to deal with the powers given to him by Jesus. Russell and his new vampire-companion Steve Newlin, along with Salome and Eric's vampire sister Nora, redefine the values of the Authority and view humans as nothing more than food: just as Lilith of the Vampire bible wanted. The season ends with the Authority leadership being wiped out during the True Blood crisis, and Bill drinking all of the sacred vial of Lilith in front of Sookie and Eric. He soon meets the \\"true death\\", but shortly after, he \\"rises from the blood\\", as an even more powerful vampire reincarnation of Lilith (\\"Billith\\").\\r\\nThe sixth season of True Blood premiered on June 16, 2013. After Alan Ball's departure from the series at the end of season 5, Brian Buckner replaced Ball as the show's showrunner. Season six focuses on Billith's growing abilities. Sookie and Jason search for Warlow, the vampire responsible for their parents death. Louisiana governor leads a platform to eradicate the entire vampire race, leaving all fates in the balance.[57]\\r\\nThe seventh and final season premiered on June 22, 2014, and the last episode was aired on August 24, 2014.\\r\\nThe first five seasons of True Blood received positive reviews, despite the fact that initial impressions were mixed. Linda Stasi of the New York Post wrote of the opening episodes:\\r\\n\\"If HBO's new vampire show is any indication, there would still be countless deaths ÿ especially among vampire hunters and the viewers who love them ÿ because everyone would be dying of boredom. And so it is with HBO's new series from death-obsessed Alan Ball, creator of the legendary Six Feet Under, whose new show True Blood, won't so much make your blood run cold as it will leave you cold.\\"[65]\\r\\nUSA Today concluded:\\r\\n\\"Sexy, witty and unabashedly peculiar, True Blood is a blood-drenched Southern Gothic romantic parable set in a world where vampires are out and about and campaigning for equal rights. Part mystery, part fantasy, part comedy, and all wildly imaginative exaggeration, [True] Blood proves that there's still vibrant life  or death  left in the 'star-crossed cute lovers' paradigm. You just have to know where to stake your romantic claim.\\"[66]\\r\\nSeason 5 was the final season with Alan Ball as showrunner, after which he was replaced by Brian Buckner. The sixth season was met with generally mixed reviews in contrast to the critical acclaim of the previous five seasons. Many critics noticed the decreasing quality of the scripts, production values, and even the acting, with more of a focus on action and less on character development. Season 7 continued this trend, receiving fewer positive reviews, and the viewing rate also declined considerably compared to previous seasons, with only 3 million tuning in every week, down from the 5 million from the fourth and fifth seasons.\\r\\nThe cast received positive reviews in the early seasons, with praise going to the performances of Nelsan Ellis and Anna Paquin. For the first season, Anna Paquin won the Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series ÿ Drama Golden Globe at the 66th Golden Globe Awards; she was also nominated the next year and won Saturn Award at the 13th Satellite Awards, a ceremony in which Nelsan Ellis also won the Saturn Award. Stephen Moyer won the Best Actor in Television award at the 2010 Saturn Awards.\\r\\nMetacritic, an aggregator of critical responses, found \\"generally favorable reviews\\" for the first five seasons, with ratings of 63, 74, 79, 74 and 74, respectively.[58][59][60][61][62] The sixth season rated 58 and the seventh 54, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[63][64]\\r\\nTrue Blood was the subject of a Sesame Street sketch parody titled \\"True Mud\\" (2010), featuring puppet versions of Sookie, Bill, Lafayette, Sam, Tara, and Sheriff Dearborn. In the skit, Muppet Sookie struggles to fulfill Muppet Bill's pleas for a pint of \\"True Mud\\", as the other characters speculate whether or not he is a \\"grouch\\".[67]\\r\\nAnna Paquin (Sookie), Stephen Moyer (Bill), and Alexander Skarsg?rd (Eric) appeared on the August 2010 cover of Rolling Stone covered in blood and completely naked. This cover drew criticism[68] due to the image's supposed promotion of sexuality and violence. The show's creator, Alan Ball, stated in the magazine, \\"To me, vampires are sex... I don't get a vampire story about abstinence. I'm 53. I don't care about high school students. I find them irritating and uninformed.\\"[68]\\r\\nThe struggle for vampire equality in True Blood has been interpreted as an allegory for the LGBT rights movement.[69] Charlaine Harris, the author of the book series on which the show is based, stated that her initial characterization for the vampires were as \\"...a minority that was trying to get equal rights\\".[70][71] Several phrases in the series are borrowed and adapted from expressions used against and about LGBT people, such as \\"God Hates Fangs\\" (God Hates Fags) and \\"Coming out of the coffin\\" (coming out of the closet).[71]\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker wrote that the show is built \\"around a series of metaphors: Vampire rights stand in for gay rights, and now the clever laughs elicited from this bratty-vampire girl represent an extreme of adolescent rebelliousness\\".[69] David Bianculli of NPR wrote, \\"True Blood is big on allegory, and the tension about accepting vampires into society is an obvious play on civil rights in general, and gay rights in particular\\".[71] However, the series' creator, Alan Ball, who is gay, has stated that such a comparison is lazy and possibly homophobic; and Lauren Gutterman of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies has expressed concerns that the show might perpetuate negative stereotypes of homosexuals as deviants.[70]\\r\\nThe first episode of True Blood debuted at a very modest 1.44 million viewers compared to the network's past drama premiers such as Big Love which premiered at 4.56 million, and John from Cincinnati which debuted at 3.4 million.[72] However, by late November 2008, 6.8 million a week were watching: this figure included repeat and on-demand viewings.[73] The season finale's viewership was 2.4 million.\\r\\nThe second-season premiere of the series (June 14, 2009) was viewed by 3.7 million, making it the most watched program on HBO since the series finale of The Sopranos. The total number of viewers for the season premiere, including the late night replay, was 5.1 million.[74] The tenth episode of the second season (August 23, 2009) was seen by 5.3 million viewers, a new record for the series.[75] The second season's finale (September 13, 2009) was seen by 5.1 million viewers. An average of 12.4 million a week watched the second season.[76]\\r\\nThe ninth episode of the fourth season (August 21, 2011) set a new record with 5.53 million viewers, making it the most viewed episode to date.[77]\\r\\nTrue Blood is HBO's most watched series since The Sopranos.[78] The show was declared the eighth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002ÿ2012).[79]\\r\\nThe show won an Outstanding Casting for a Drama at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards; the two lead actors have both been recognized for their performances:\\r\\nThe show received an American Film Institute Award in 2009 as \\"One of the 10 Best TV Programs\\" and was chosen as \\"Favorite TV Obsession\\" at the 36th People's Choice Awards. Its stunt performers have been recognized for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards.\\r\\nThe True Blood DVDs have been consistent best-sellers in the US. By the end of 2009, the first season DVD had sold over 1.6 million units and taken in over $57 million. It was the only TV show in the 50 top-selling DVDs of 2009.[89] The second season DVD sold a total of 1,159,509 units in 2010, earning over $41 million.[90] The third season DVD was the 61st best-selling DVD of 2011, selling almost 1 million copies and earning over $30 million. It was the best selling TV box set of 2011.[91] In its first week of releasethe week ending June 2, 2012season four debuted at number one on the UK \\"TV on Video\\" chart.[92] However, it reached only number six in the combined DVD chart.[93] In its first week of release in North America, it sold over 660,000 units, earning nearly $20 million.[94] In its second week of release in North America, it sold a further 120,000 units (making a combined total of 784,000 units sold), earning another $4 million.[95]","input":"How many series are there of true blood?"},{"output":"Mir Jumla","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Saraighat was fought in 1671 between the Mughal empire (led by the Kachwaha king, Raja Ramsingh I), and the Ahom Kingdom (led by Lachit Borphukan) on the Brahmaputra river at Saraighat, now in Guwahati, Assam, India.[1] Although much weaker, the Ahom Army defeated the Mughal Army by brilliant uses of the terrain, clever diplomatic negotiations to buy time, guerrilla tactics, psychological warfare, military intelligence and by exploiting the sole weakness of the Mughal forcesits navy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Saraighat was the last battle in the last major attempt by the Mughals to extend their empire into Assam.  Though the Mughals managed to regain Guwahati briefly after a later Borphukan deserted it, the Ahoms wrested control in the Battle of Itakhuli in 1682 and maintained it till the end of their rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Nara Narayana died in 1587, the Koch kingdom (ensconced between the Mughal Empire in the west/south and Ahom kingdom in the east) was divided into the western Koch Bihar and the eastern Koch Hajo, ruled by his son Lakshimi Narayan and nephew Raghudev respectively.  These two kingdoms were bitter rivals.  In due course the Mughals formed an alliance with Lakshmi Narayan and the Nawab of Dhaka, a governor of the Mughals attacked Parikshit Narayan, the son of Raghudev in 1602 at Dhubri, the western most corner of present-day Assam.  Following many battles, Parikshit finally accepted defeat and was sent off to Delhi; but his brother, Bali Narayana took refuge with the Ahoms, who were interested in keeping the Koch as a buffer between themselves and the Mughals.  The first Mughal-Ahom battle took place in 1615 when the Mughals attacked the Ahoms, then under Pratap Singha. This resulted in a period of Ahom-Mughal conflicts fluctuating fortunes that ended with the Treaty of Asurar Ali in 1639.  The Treaty fixed Barnadi river in the north bank and Asurar Ali in the south bank of the Brahmaputra as the boundary between the Ahoms and the Mughals.  This, and the defeat of the Koch king at Pandu in 1641, resulted in a period of Mughal administration in Kamrup (Guwahati and Hajo).\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking advantage of the Mughal war of succession after the fall of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1658, Pran Narayan of Koch Bihar tried to occupy Koch Hajo, but the Ahoms under Jayadhwaj Singha took Guwahati and pushed him back beyond Dhubri. That the Ahoms reached Dhubri by defeating the Koch king and not the Mughals would form a central tenet in later Ahom diplomacy. Soon after, Aurangzeb occupied the Delhi throne.  Mir Jumla II, pursuing Shah Shuja in Bengal, was appointed the Subahdar of Bengal in 1660 and asked to retake Assam.  Mir Jumla marched in 1661 and defeated the Ahoms at successive encounters to finally take the Ahom capital Garhgaon.  But the daga juddha (guerrilla warfare) of Atan Burhagohain and the rains succeeded in cutting off Mughal communication lines making it impossible for Mir Jumla to consolidate Mughal rule.  Unaware of Mir Jumlas difficulties and unnerved by Baduli Phukan's defection, Jayadhwaj Singha sued for peace,[2] an opportunity Mir Jumla seized on. The Treaty of Ghilajharighat (1663) brought an end to Mughal occupation of Garhgaon, but the conditions of this treaty were so severe that the Ahoms were soon resolved to reverse them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the  humiliating defeat inflicted by Mir Jumla the Ahom king Jayadhwaj Singha died in despair. On his deathbed, he exhorted his cousin and successor Chakradhwaj Singha to \\"remove the spear of humiliation from the bosom of the nation.\\" There followed a complete overhaul of the Ahom kingdom.  People who had dispersed due to Mir Jumla's invasion were rehabilitated in the appropriate khels, food and military productions were increased, new forts were constructed and garrisoned and an experditionary army was organized under a new commanderLachit Borphukan.[3][4] Alliances were renewed with the Jaintia and the Kachari kingdoms. During this period Mughal imperial demands were tactfully and diplomatically rebuffed, but when the new faujdar of Guwahati, Firuz Khan, forced the matter in March 1667, the Ahoms were compelled to move.[5]  In August 1667 the Ahom army, under Lachit Borphukan and accompanied by Atan Burhagohain, sailed downstream to retake Guwahati.\\r\\n\\r\\nLachit made Kaliabor, the old seat of the Borphukan, his base camp and advanced toward Guwahati along both banks of the Brahmaputra.  On the north bank the Deka Phukan retook Bahbari in early September 1667.  On the south bank, the Nausalia Phukan and others, moving on land and water, captured Kajali, Sonapur, Panikhaiti, and Titamara forts between the Kapili river and Guwahati.  The Ahoms then reached Guwahati which was defended by five choukies on each bank of the Brahmaputra (northKanai-borosi-bowa, Hillar, Hindurighopa, Patduar and Korai; southLatasil, Joiduar, Dharamduar, Duarguria and Pandu).  With some loss, the Ahoms captured Shah Buruz and Rangamahal forts, a little north of the city.  An extended battle was fought for the Itakhuli fort (at the site of the current Deputy Commissioner's bungalow).  The Ahoms besieged Joiduar, occupied Pandu, and in spite of a Mughal reinforcement, approached Itakhuli.  The grand attack was launched on the night of 4 November 1667,[6] when the Ahoms scaled the walls by ladders and after two months of siege, Itakhuli fell in mid-November 1667.  Most of the defenders were massacred, many surrendered but a few managed to escape.  War provisions, treasures and war material fell into Ahom hands.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals received some reinforcement at this point and retaliated against the Ahoms.  The Ahoms fought back with their naval forces and removed them from their bases in Umananda and Barhat. The Mughals, pursued by the Ahoms, managed to fortify the Manahmukh (the confluence of Manas river) and fend off the attackers for some time but Firuz Khan finally surrendered and was taken prisoner. This brought an end to the recapture of Guwahati and the Ahoms were able to control their old Manas border once again.  But this did not last long and they had to beat a strategic retreat due to the advancing Mughal army of Raja Ram Singh.\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal emperor Aurangzeb was informed of the losses on 19 December 1667 and he commissioned Raja Ram Singh of Amber, son of the famous Mirza Raja Jai Singh, to take back Guwahati.  Ram Singh left Delhi on 27 December 1667 and finally reached Rangamati in February 1669.  He was accompanied, as was the Mughal custom of sending two generals, by Rashid Khan, ex-faujdar of Guwahati, and from Patna by the Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur. The Ahoms, anticipating a Mughal strike, are said to have followed his movements from Delhi itself.  Along the way Aurangzeb augmented Ram Singh's forces of 4,000 troopers (from his char-hazaari mansab), 1,500 ahadis (soldiers recruited by the Emperor) and 500 barqandezes by an additional 30,000 infantrymen, 21 Rajput chiefs (Thakurs) with their contingents, 18,000 cavalry, 2,000 archers and shieldmen and 40 ships.[8]  When Lachit surveyed the massive Mughal force later, he was moved to tears and he uttered: \\"It is a tragedy that my country is facing this dire catastrophe during my Phukanship. How will my king be saved? How will my people be saved? And how will my posterity be saved?\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nArmies from Koch Bihar joined the Mughal forces since they were vassals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAware of Mughal military might and the weakness of the Ahom militia, especially against the professional cavalry and mounted forces in open fields, Lachit Borphukan and the other commanders decided to choose the terrain of the battlefield with care. The choice fell on Guwahati, which was hilly, on the way to the heart of the Ahom kingdom and without open fields where the Mughal forces would not have sufficient mobility. The only way east was via the Brahmaputra river passing through it. The Brahmaputra at Saraighat, at its narrowest 1?km width, was ideal for a naval defense. To check Mughal advance, Lachit prepared a complex system of mud embankments in Guwahati[10] When the Mughals found Guwahati impregnable by land, they would be forced to use their navy, which was their weakest asset. Lachit set up his headquarters at Andharubali, the sandbanks between the Kamakhya and Sukreshwar hills. The deliberations of the war council were recorded and made into a manual.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Mughal march reached the Manas river in MarchÿApril 1669 and defeated some Ahom forces, Lachit decided on a strategic retreat to Guwahati. Three Rajkhowas were asked to meet the Mughal forces and retreat to Guwahati, keeping the Mughal forces in sight but beyond the reach of their weapons. When the Mughals reached closer, he started a sham negotiation via the captured Firuz Khan with Ram Singh, who had set up camp at Agiathuti, calling the Mughal Emperor the \\"Bhai Raja\\" (brother sovereign) to the Ahom king.[12] And when he was ready for the Mughal attacks, he sent words to Ram Singh that \\"Guwahati and Kamrup do not belong to the Mughals\\" since they were taken from the Koch and that the Assamese were prepared to fight to the last.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nA period of battles between the Ahom and Mughal forces in the region of Guwahati followed, with varied results with forts changing hands many times. In these battles, the Mughal forces were arraigned in four divisions:[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these attacks the Ahom alliesthe Garos, the Jaintia, the Nagas, the Rani of Darrang, the Raja of Rani, and even the monsoons of 1669joined battle.  The Ahom defense was arraigned as:[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth commanders had a number of pali commanders each defending a specific strategic area, with each pali reorganized in response to the challenge posed by Ram Singh's forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nAurangzeb received information of the lack of progress in August 1669 and made arrangements with the Subahdar of Bengal, Shaistha Khan, to provide reinforcements to Ram Singh. This period is also known for Atan Burhagohain's dagga judha (guerilla warfare). Ram Singh  protested that these harassing campaigns lowered the \\"dignity of warfare\\", and withdrew from fighting (October 1669 ÿ March 1970), to no particular military advantage.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these battles stood out for a major Ahom reversal.  Exasperated with the delaying tactics of the Borphukan, Ram Singh asked for a duel with the Ahom king. He promised to withdraw from Assam with his army if he was defeated.  Lachit updated Chakradhwaj Singha about this proposal, who rejected the offer on the ground that it was beneath his dignity to duel a mere servant \\"who has no umbrella over his head\\" (who is not a \\"Chhatrapati\\").  Annoyed with Ram Singh's proposal he ordered Lachit to confront the Mughals militarily. In a battle that was set up as a challenge, a force of 10,000 Mughals under Mir Nawab was to confront a force of 20,000 Ahom cavalry. Ram Singh's \\"approach was psychological, marked by pride, chivalry and revenge\\". The Ahom approach, to cover their basic weaknesses, was based on \\"diplomacy, deception and mispresentation\\". So instead of 20,000, they sent in 40,000 and using an anti-koch tactic that had worked against Chilarai, they dressed their vanguard archers and musketeers as Brahmans to make the Rajput warriors desist from killing them. Ram Singh, on the other hand, set a woman, Madanavati, dressed as a man, to command the vanguard to deny the Ahoms any glory in case of a victory. The battle took place in the fields adjoining the Alaboi hills about 5 August 1669.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first phase, Madanavati dispersed the first four lines of the Ahom vanguard with ease, but the Borphukan had trenches dug to conceal his other lines. In the second phase, a diversion to cross the Brahmaputra was thwarted, and Madanavati was shot.  The battle turned and in the third phase, Mir Nawab's forces were routed. Enraged at the deception, Ram Singh let loose his veteran horsemen and in the carnage that followed, 10,000 Ahom soldiers were massacred.\\r\\n\\r\\nAurangzeb was pleased with these Mughal successes and increased Ram Singh's mansab from 4000 to 5000.  Ram Singh was also instructed to invest Guwahati soon, and if it was not possible, to devastate the land and plunder the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Mughal advances in late 1669, Ram Singh began diplomatic efforts. The proposal was for the Assamese to evacuate Guwahati and a return to the 1639 status quo (Treaty of Asurar Ali) in return for a Mughal payment of 300,000 rupees. The Ahoms did not respond favorably. Ram Singh next attempted to bribe and create divisions among the Ahom field commanders (Phukans). In the meantime, the Ahom king Chakradhwaj Singha died and was succeeded by his brother Udayaditya Singha. The long war had resulted in popular discontent in the Ahom kingdom.  Ram Singh again put forward his proposal on the 1639 status quo settlement and this time the Ahoms appeared receptive. The Ahom king, though displeased, left the decision to his commanders in Guwahati. In the meeting which included Lachit Borphukan, the only dissenter to the proposal was Atan Burhagohain, who displayed his statesmanship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtan Burhagohain argued that there was no guarantee that the Emperor at Delhi will abide by Ram Singh's assurance. Also, a settlement then would mean that the drain on the country's resources would have been in vain. Further, what was the guarantee that once the Mughals take Guwahati, they would not reach for Garhgaon or even Namrup.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAtan Burhagohain was able to persuade the other commanders and the Ahoms rejected this proposal. The diplomatic efforts of Ram Singh failed once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Mughal reinforcements in the shape of war-vessels and imperial officers (Omraos) reached Ram Singh, along with the Mughal admiral, Munnawar Khan and the Mughal Viceroy Shaista Khan, sent the message that Ram Singh was sent to fight the Assamese, not make friends with them.[18] Ram Singh now made preparations for his final and direct assault on Guwahati and began moving along the northbank. Near Sualkuchi he was joined by ships with artillery and archers under five sardars. The Mughals had large boats, some carrying as many as sixteen cannons. The Mughal ambassador, Paditrai, had reported a breach in the embankment at Andharubali a few days earlier, and Ram Singh wanted to exploit this opening.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ahom soldiers were demoralised after their losses at Allaboi. Their commander-in-chief, Lachit Borphukan and their admiral were both seriously ill, and the Nara Raja, the son of the Miri Sandikoi, was in command. An encounter both on land and water ensued near Ashwakranta. The Ahom land forces, under Laluk Borgohain Phukan, worsted the Mughals, but the Mughal boats compelled the Ahom boats to retreat to Barhila, north of Saraighat. The land forces, fearing an encirclement, too retreated.[20]  The battle reached a crucial phase, when the Mughals were beginning to get close to Andharubali. The Borphukan, as well as the Nara Raja sent messages to inspire the soldiers. It looked as if there was a break in command and some boats began falling back to Kajali and Samdhara. Lachit Barphukan was observing this from  his sickbed in the gatehouse of the Itakhuli fort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this crucial moment in the battle, when the Mughals were about to land at Andharubali, the Borphukan sent orders via katakis to all the land and naval forces to attack. He also ordered seven war-boats[21] for himself and had Nadai of Kharangi carry him to a boat. He shouted \\"The King has put all the people in my hands to fight the Bongal. Shall I go back to my wife and children?\\" and pushed a few men into the water. With the other six war-boats the Borphukan headed toward the naval battle.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entry of the Borphukan transformed the Ahom soldiers. His small flotilla soon swelled with Ahom warships from all sides that smashed into the Mughal warships at Amrajuli on the north bank, opposite Kamakhya hills. The triangle in the river, between Itakhuli, Kamakhya and Aswakranta was filled with men and boat. The Ahoms spanned the river over an improviso bridge of boats and resorted to a combined front and rear attack. The Mughal admiral Munnawar Khan, smoking a hookah was killed by a gunshot from the back, throwing the Mughals out of gear. They suffered the loss of three top-ranking amirs, and another 4000 dead. The day of this decisive battle is not known for certain, only that it happened in the middle of March 1671.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals were pursued to the Manas river, the Ahom kingdom's western boundary. The Borphukan instructed his men not to attack the retreating army, reminding them of Alaboi.[23]  Anticipating a counterattack, he set messengers at regular intervals, while Atan Burhagohain and other commanders stood ready for one. The Mughals in Darrang were also worsted, and Ram Singh left Kamrup on 7 April 1671 for Rangamati.[24]  Ram Singh waited in vain for another opportunity and finally had an audience with Aurangzeb on 25 June 1676.\\r\\n\\r\\nLachit Borphukan died at Kaliabor about a year later in April 1672, but not from the illness at Saraighat.[25]  And this was not the final battle between the Ahoms and the Mughals, nor did Guwahati remain with the Ahoms. Lachit Borphukan's own brother and successor Borphukan, Laluk Sola, deserted Guwahati for the Mughals in 1679. It remained with the Mughals until 1682, when the Ahoms under Gadadhar Singha recovered it and ended Mughal control in Kamrup for ever, though the Mughal administration of 80 years cast a long shadow.","input":"Who was the ahom king during the battle of saraighat?"},{"output":"Tasman Sea","context":"The Tasman Sea (Mori: Te Tai-o-Rehua[1]) is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about 2,000 kilometres (1,200?mi) across and about 2,800 kilometres (1,700?mi) from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.[2]\\r\\nThe Tasman Sea is informally referred to in both Australian and New Zealand English as The Ditch; for example, crossing the Ditch means travelling to Australia from New Zealand, or vice versa. The diminutive term \\"The Ditch\\" used for the Tasman Sea is comparable to referring to the North Atlantic Ocean as \\"The Pond\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe south of the sea is passed over by depressions going from west to east. The northern limit of these westerly winds is near to 40S. During the southern winter, from April to October, the northern branch of these winds from west changes it directions towards the north and goes up against trade winds. Hence, the sea receives frequent winds from southwest during this period. In the Australian summer from November to March the southern branch of trade winds goes up against west winds and therefore, winds come frequently in the sea.[3]\\r\\nThe sea circumscribes a water body of 2,250 kilometres (1,400 miles) wide and 2,300,000 kilometres (1,400,000 miles) in area.[4] The depth of the sea is 5,493 metres (18,022 feet).[5] The base of the sea is made up of globigerina ooze. A small zone of pteropod ooze is found to the south of New Caledonia and to the southern extent of 30S, siliceous ooze can be found.[6]\\r\\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Tasman Sea as follows:[7]\\r\\nOn the West. A line from Gabo Island (near Cape Howe, 3730'S) to the Northeast point of East Sister Island (148E) thence along the 148th meridian to Flinders Island; beyond this Island a line running to the Eastward of the Vansittart Shoals to [Cape] Barren Island, and from Cape Barren (the Easternmost point of [Cape] Barren Island) to Eddystone Point (41S) in Tasmania, thence along the East coast to South East Cape, the Southern point of Tasmania.\\r\\nOn the North. The parallel of 30S from the Australian coast Eastward as far as a line joining the East extremities of Elizabeth Reef and South East Rock (3147S 15918E? / ?31.783S 159.300E? / -31.783; 159.300) then to the Southward along this line to the South East Rock [an outlier of Lord Howe Island].\\r\\nOn the Northeast. From the South East Rock to the North point of Three Kings Islands (3410S 17210E? / ?34.167S 172.167E? / -34.167; 172.167) thence to North Cape in New Zealand.\\r\\nOn the East.\\r\\nOn the Southeast. A line running from South West Cape, Stewart Island, through The Snares (48S, 16630'E) to North West Cape, Auckland Island (5030S 16610E? / ?50.500S 166.167E? / -50.500; 166.167), through this island to its Southern point.\\r\\nOn the South. A line joining the Southern point of Auckland Island (5055S 1660E? / ?50.917S 166.000E? / -50.917; 166.000) to South East Cape, the Southern point of Tasmania.\\r\\nThe Tasman Sea's mid-ocean ridge developed between 85 and 55 million years ago as Australia and Zealandia broke apart during the breakup of supercontinent Gondwana. It lies roughly midway between the continental margins of Australia and Zealandia. Much of Zealandia is submerged, so the ridge runs much closer to the Australian coast than New Zealand's.[8]\\r\\nThe Tasman Sea features a number of mid-sea island groups, quite apart from coastal islands located near the Australian and New Zealand mainlands:\\r\\nA deep-sea research ship, the Tangaroa explored the sea and found 500 species of fish and 1300 species of invertebrates. The tooth of Megalodon, an extinct shark was also found by some researchers.[16]\\r\\nMoncrieff and Hood were the first to attempt a Trans-Tasman crossing by plane in 1928. The first successful flight over the sea was accomplished by Charles Kingsford Smith later that year. The first person to row solo across the sea was Colin Quincey in 1977. The next successful solo crossing was completed by his son, Shaun Quincey in 2010.[17]\\r\\nCoordinates: 40S 160E? / ?40S 160E? / -40; 160","input":"What sea is between new zealand and australia?"},{"output":"December 1800","context":"The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol Building, is the home of the United States Congress, and the seat of the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants.\\r\\nThe original building was completed in 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome, and expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey).[2] In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\\r\\nAfter adopting the Articles of Confederation in York, Pennsylvania, the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall, demanding payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress requested that John Dickinson, the Governor of Pennsylvania, call up the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to Princeton, New Jersey, on June 21, 1783,[3] and met in Annapolis, Maryland, and Trenton, New Jersey, before ending up in New York City.\\r\\nThe United States Congress was established upon ratification of the United States Constitution and formally began on March 4, 1789. New York City remained home to Congress until July 1790,[4] when the Residence Act was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital. The decision to locate the capital was contentious, but Alexander Hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the Potomac River. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready.[5]\\r\\nPierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant was given the task of creating the city plan for the new capital city.[6] L'Enfant chose Jenkin's Hill as the site for the \\"Congress House\\", with a \\"grand avenue\\" (now Pennsylvania Avenue, NW) connecting it with the President's House, and a public space containing a broader \\"grand avenue\\" (now the National Mall) stretching westward to the Potomac River (see: L'Enfant Plan).[7][8]\\r\\nIn reviewing L'Enfant's plan, Thomas Jefferson insisted the legislative building be called the \\"Capitol\\" rather than \\"Congress House\\".[7] The word \\"Capitol\\" comes from Latin and is associated with the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome.[9][10] The connection between the two is not, however, crystal clear.[11] In addition to coming up with a city plan, L'Enfant had been tasked with designing the Capitol and President's House; however, he was dismissed in February 1792 over disagreements with President George Washington and the commissioners, and there were no plans at that point for the Capitol.[12]\\r\\nIn spring 1792, United States Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson proposed a design competition to solicit designs for the Capitol and the \\"President's House\\", and set a four-month deadline. The prize for the competition was $500 and a lot in the Federal City. At least ten individuals submitted designs for the Capitol; however the drawings were regarded as crude and amateurish, reflecting the level of architectural skill present in the United States at the time.[13] The most promising of the submissions was by Stephen Hallet, a trained French architect.[14] However, Hallet's designs were overly fancy, with too much French influence, and were deemed too costly.[15]\\r\\nA late entry by amateur architect William Thornton was submitted on January 31, 1793, to much praise for its \\"Grandeur, Simplicity, and Beauty\\" by Washington, along with praise from Thomas Jefferson. Thornton was inspired by the east front of the Louvre, as well as the Paris Pantheon for the center portion of the design.[16][17] Thornton's design was officially approved in a letter dated April 5, 1793, from Washington, and Thornton served as the first Architect of the Capitol (and later first Superintendent of the United States Patent Office).[18] In an effort to console Hallet, the commissioners appointed him to review Thornton's plans, develop cost estimates, and serve as superintendent of construction. Hallet proceeded to pick apart and make drastic changes to Thornton's design, which he saw as costly to build and problematic.[19] In July 1793, Jefferson convened a five-member commission, bringing Hallet and Thornton together, along with James Hoban (winning architect of the \\"President's Palace\\") to address problems with and revise Thornton's plan. Hallet suggested changes to the floor plan, which could be fitted within the exterior design by Thornton.[20][21] The revised plan was accepted, except that Secretary Jefferson and President Washington insisted on an open recess in the center of the East front, which was part of Thornton's original plan.[22]\\r\\nThe original design by Thornton was later modified by the famous British-American architects Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Sr., and then Charles Bulfinch.[23] The current cast-iron dome and the House's new southern extension and Senate new northern wing were designed by Thomas U. Walter and August Schoenborn, a German immigrant, in the 1850s,[24] and were completed under the supervision of Edward Clark.[25]\\r\\nL'Enfant secured the lease of quarries at Wigginton Island and along Aquia Creek in Virginia for use in the foundations and outer walls of the Capitol in November 1791.[26] Surveying was under way soon after the Jefferson conference plan for the Capitol was accepted.[20] On September 18, 1793, President George Washington, along with eight other Freemasons dressed in masonic regalia, laid the cornerstone, which was made by silversmith Caleb Bentley.[27][28]\\r\\nConstruction proceeded with Hallet working under supervision of James Hoban, who was also busy working on construction of the \\"President's House\\" (also later known as the \\"Executive Mansion\\"). Despite the wishes of Jefferson and the President, Hallet went ahead anyway and modified Thornton's design for the East Front and created a square central court that projected from the center, with flanking wings which would house the legislative bodies. Hallet was dismissed by Secretary Jefferson on November 15, 1794.[29] George Hadfield was hired on October 15, 1795, as Superintendent of Construction, but resigned three years later in May 1798, because of his dissatisfaction with Thornton's plan and quality of work done thus far.[30]\\r\\nThe Senate (north) wing was completed in 1800. The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing which served for a few years for the Representatives to meet in, until the House of Representatives (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would eventually be. However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its first session of the United States Congress with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely, at the urging of President John Adams, in hopes of securing enough Southern votes in the Electoral College to be re-elected for a second term as President.[31]\\r\\nFor several decades, beginning when the federal government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, the Capitol building was used for Sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions. The first services were conducted in the \\"hall\\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \\"Oven\\", which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Then, from 1807 to 1857, they were held in the then-House Chamber (now called Statuary Hall). When held in the House chamber, the Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. According to the U.S. Library of Congress exhibit Religion and the Founding of the American Republic:\\r\\nIt is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801ÿ1809) and of James Madison (1809ÿ1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the Housea practice that continued until after the Civil Warwere acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \\"crowded audience\\".[32]\\r\\nNot long after the completion of both wings, the Capitol was partially burned by the British on August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812. George Bomford and Joseph Gardner Swift, both military engineers, were called upon to help rebuild the Capitol. Reconstruction began in 1815 and included redesigned chambers for both Senate and House wings (now sides), which were completed by 1819. During the reconstruction, Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol, a temporary structure financed by local investors. Construction continued through to 1826, with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior Rotunda, rising above the first low dome of the Capitol. Latrobe is principally connected with the original construction and many innovative interior features; his successor, Bulfinch, also played a major role, such as the design of the first low dome covered in copper.\\r\\nBy 1850, it became clear that the Capitol could not accommodate the growing number of legislators arriving from newly admitted states. A new design competition was held, and President Millard Fillmore appointed Philadelphia architect Thomas U. Walter to carry out the expansion. Two new wings were added ÿ a new chamber for the House of Representatives on the south side, and a new chamber for the Senate on the north.[33]\\r\\nWhen the Capitol was expanded in the 1850s, some of the construction labor was carried out by slaves \\"who cut the logs, laid the stones and baked the bricks\\".[34] The original plan was to use workers brought in from Europe; however, there was a poor response to recruitment efforts, and African Americans, some free and some enslaved, composed the majority of the work force.[35]\\r\\nThe 1850 expansion more than doubled the length of the Capitol, dwarfing the original, timber-framed, copper-sheeted, low dome of 1818, designed by Charles Bulfinch and no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building. In 1855, the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the \\"wedding-cake style\\" cast-iron dome that stands today. Also designed by Thomas U. Walter, the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and 100 feet (30?m) in diameter, yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers. Like Mansart's dome at \\"Les Invalides\\" (which he had visited in 1838), Walter's dome is double, with a large oculus in the inner dome, through which is seen \\"The Apotheosis of Washington\\" painted on a shell suspended from the supporting ribs, which also support the visible exterior structure and the tholos that supports The \\"Statue of Freedom\\", a colossal statue that was raised to the top of the dome in 1863. This statue was cast by a slave named Philip Reid. The weight of the cast iron for the dome has been published as 8,909,200 pounds (4,041,100?kg).[36]\\r\\nWhen the Capitol's new dome was finally completed, its massive visual weight, in turn, overpowered the proportions of the columns of the East Portico, built in 1828. The East Front of the Capitol building was rebuilt in 1904, following a design of the architects Carrre and Hastings, who also designed the Russell Senate and Cannon House office buildings.\\r\\nThe next major expansion to the Capitol started in 1958, with a 33.5 feet (10.2?m) extension of the East Portico.[citation needed] During this project, in 1960 the dome underwent a restoration.[37] A marble duplicate of the sandstone East Front was built 33.5 feet (10.2?m) from the old Front. (In 1962, a connecting extension incorporated what had been an outside wall as an inside wall.) In the process, the Corinthian columns were removed. It was not until 1984 that landscape designer Russell Page created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the U.S. National Arboretum in northeast Washington as the National Capitol Columns, where they are combined with a reflecting pool in an ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of Persepolis, in Persia. Besides the columns, hundreds of blocks of the original stone were removed and are stored behind a National Park Service maintenance yard in Rock Creek Park.[38][39]\\r\\nOn December 19, 1960, the Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service.[40] The building was ranked #6 in a 2007 survey conducted for the American Institute of Architects' \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\" list.[41] The Capitol draws heavily from other notable buildings, especially churches and landmarks in Europe, including the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and St. Paul's Cathedral in London.[42] On the roofs of the Senate and House Chambers are flagpoles that fly the U.S. flag when either is in session. On September 18, 1993, to commemorate the Capitol's bicentennial, the Masonic ritual cornerstone laying with George Washington was reenacted. U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond was one of the Freemason politicians who took part in the ceremony.\\r\\nOn June 20, 2000, ground was broken for the Capitol Visitor Center, which opened on December 2, 2008.[43] From 2001 through 2008, the East Front of the Capitol (site of most presidential inaugurations until Ronald Reagan began a new tradition in 1981) was the site of construction for this massive underground complex, designed to facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the Capitol. Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building. The new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall, a visitors theater, room for exhibits, and dining and restroom facilities, in addition to space for building necessities such as an underground service tunnel.\\r\\nA large-scale Capitol dome restoration project, the first extensive such work since 1959ÿ1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration.[44] As of 2012, $20 million in work around the skirt of the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron that have led to rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed. Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend $61 million to repair the exterior of the dome. The House wanted to spend less on government operations,[37] but in late 2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two years, starting in spring 2014.[45] Extensive scaffolding was erected in 2014, enclosing and obscuring the dome.[44] All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid-September 2016.[46]\\r\\nThe Capitol building is marked by its central dome above a rotunda in the central section of the structure (which also includes, the older original smaller center flanked by the two original (designed 1793, occupied 1800) smaller two wings (inner north) and inner south) containing the two original smaller meeting chambers for the Senate and the House of Representatives (between 1800 and late 1850s) and then flanked by two further extended (newer) wings, one also for each chamber of the larger, more populous Congress: the new north wing is the Senate chamber and the new south wing is the House of Representatives chamber. Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives. It is an example of the neoclassical architecture style.\\r\\nUnderground tunnels and internal subways connect the Capitol building with the Congressional office buildings in the Capitol Complex. All rooms in the Capitol are designated as either S (for Senate) or H (for House), depending on whether they are in the Senate or House wing of the Capitol.\\r\\nThe Capitol has a long history in art of the United States, beginning in 1856 with Italian/Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol. The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors,[47] reflect great moments and people in United States history. Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the Spirit of St. Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger shuttle crew.\\r\\nBrumidi also worked within the Rotunda. He is responsible for the painting of The Apotheosis of Washington beneath the top of the dome, and also the famous Frieze of American History.[48] The Apotheosis of Washington was completed in 11 months and painted by Brumidi while suspended nearly 180 feet (55?m) in the air. It is said to be the first attempt by the United States to deify a founding father. Washington is depicted surrounded by 13 maidens in an inner ring with many Greek and Roman gods and goddesses below him in a second ring. The frieze is located around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological, pictorial history of the United States from the landing of Christopher Columbus to the Wright Brothers's flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The frieze was started in 1878 and was not completed until 1953. The frieze was therefore painted by four different artists: Brumidi, Filippo Costaggini, Charles Ayer Whipple, and Allyn Cox. The final scenes depicted in the fresco had not yet occurred when Brumidi began his Frieze of the United States History.\\r\\nWithin the Rotunda there are eight large paintings about the development of the United States as a nation. On the east side are four paintings depicting major events in the discovery of America. On the west are four paintings depicting the founding of the United States. The east side paintings include The Baptism of Pocahontas by John Gadsby Chapman, The Embarkation of the Pilgrims by Robert Walter Weir, The Discovery of the Mississippi by William Henry Powell, and The Landing of Columbus by John Vanderlyn. The paintings on the west side are by John Trumbull: Declaration of Independence, Surrender of General Burgoyne, Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, and General George Washington Resigning His Commission. Trumbull was a contemporary of the United States' founding fathers and a participant in the American Revolutionary War; he painted a self-portrait into Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.\\r\\nFirst Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln hangs over the west staircase in the Senate wing.[49]\\r\\nThe Capitol also houses the National Statuary Hall Collection, comprising two statues donated by each of the fifty states to honor persons notable in their histories. One of the most notable statues in the National Statuary Hall is a bronze statue of King Kamehameha donated by the state of Hawaii upon its accession to the union in 1959. The statue's extraordinary weight of 15,000 pounds (6,800?kg) raised concerns that it might come crashing through the floor, so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center. The 100th, and last statue for the collection, that of Po'pay from the state of New Mexico, was added on September 22, 2005. It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall.\\r\\nOn the ground floor is an area known as the Crypt. It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed balustrade at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb. However, under the stipulations of his last will, Washington was buried at Mount Vernon. The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol. A compass star inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C. is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how addresses in Washington, D.C., are designated (NE, NW, SE, or SW). However, due to the retrocession of the Virginia portions of the District, the geographic center of the city lies near the White House.\\r\\nWithin the Crypt is Gutzon Borglum's massive Abraham Lincoln Bust. The sculptor had a fascination with large-scale art and themes of heroic nationalism, and carved the piece from a six-ton block of marble. Borglum carved the bust in 1908, and it was donated to the Congress by Eugene Meyer, Jr., and accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library, in the same year. The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in 1911. The bust and pedestal were on display in the Rotunda for many years until 1979 when, after a rearrangement of all sculpture in the Rotunda, they were placed in the Crypt.[50] Borglum was a patriot; believing that the \\"monuments we have built are not our own,\\" he looked to create art that was \\"American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement\\", according to a 1908 interview article. Borglum's depiction of Lincoln was so accurate, that Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's son, praised the bust as \\"the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen.\\"[50] Supposedly, according to legend, the marble head remains unfinished (missing a left ear) to symbolize Lincoln's unfinished life.\\r\\nAt one end of the room near the Old Supreme Court Chamber is a statue of John C. Calhoun. On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the 1998 shooting incident is clearly visible. The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.\\r\\nEleven presidents have lain in state in the Rotunda for public viewing, most recently Gerald Ford. The tomb meant for Washington stored the catafalque which is used to support coffins lying in state or honor in the Capitol. The catafalque is now on display in the Capitol Visitors Center for the general public to see when not in use.\\r\\nThe Hall of Columns is located on the House side of the Capitol, home to twenty-eight fluted columns and statues from the National Statuary Hall Collection. In the basement of the Capitol building in a utility room are two marble bathtubs, which are all that remain of the once elaborate Senate baths. These baths were a spa-like facility designed for members of Congress and their guests before many buildings in the city had modern plumbing. The facilities included several bathtubs, a barbershop, and a massage parlor.\\r\\nA steep, metal staircase, totaling 365 steps, leads from the basement to an outdoor walkway on top of the Capitol's dome.[51] The number of steps represents each day of the year.[52] Also in the basement, the weekly Jummah prayer is held on Fridays by Muslim staffers.[53]\\r\\nContrary to a popular myth, D.C. building height laws have never referred to the height of the Capitol building, which rises to 289 feet (88?m).[54] Indeed, the Capitol is only the fifth-tallest structure in Washington.\\r\\nThe House of Representatives Chamber has 448 permanent seats. Unlike Senators, Representatives do not have assigned seats.[55] The chamber is large enough to accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events. It is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history. The United States national motto \\"In God We Trust\\" is written over the tribune below the clock and above the United States flag. Of the twenty-three relief portraits only Moses is sculpted from a full front view and is located across from the dais where the Speaker of the House ceremonially sits.\\r\\nIn order clockwise around the chamber:\\r\\nThere is also a quote etched in the marble of the chamber, as stated by venerable statesman Daniel Webster: \\"Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.\\"[57]\\r\\nFrom 1800 to 1806, this room served as the Senate Chamber and from 1806 until 1860, the room was used as the Supreme Court Chamber. In 1860, the Supreme Court began using the newly vacated Old Senate Chamber. Since 1935, the Supreme Court has met in the United States Supreme Court Building.\\r\\nThe current Senate Chamber opened in 1859[58] and is adorned with white marble busts of the former Presidents of the Senate (Vice Presidents).[59]\\r\\nThe Capitol Grounds cover approximately 274 acres (1.11?km2), with the grounds proper consisting mostly of lawns, walkways, streets, drives, and planting areas. Several monumental sculptures used to be located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including The Rescue and George Washington. The current grounds were designed by noted American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from 1874 to 1892. In 1875, as one of his first recommendations, Olmsted proposed the construction of the marble terraces on the north, west, and south sides of the building that exist today.\\r\\nOlmsted also designed the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits just north of the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.\\r\\nUp to four U.S. flags can be seen flying over the Capitol. Two flagpoles are located at the base of the dome on the East and West sides. These flagpoles have flown the flag day and night since World War I. The other two flagpoles are above the North (Senate) and South (House of Representatives) wings of the building, and fly only when the chamber below is in session. The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by House pages. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the Senate Sergeant at Arms's office. Several auxiliary flagpoles, to the west of the dome and not visible from the ground, are used to meet congressional requests for flags flown over the Capitol.[citation needed] Constituents pay for U.S. flags flown over the Capitol to commemorate a variety of events such as the death of a veteran family member.\\r\\nThe Capitol, as well as the grounds of Capitol Hill, have played host to major events, including presidential inaugurations held every four years. During an inauguration, the front of the Capitol is outfitted with a platform and a grand staircase. Annual events at the Capitol include Independence Day celebrations, and the National Memorial Day Concert.\\r\\nThe general public has paid respect to a number of individuals lying in state at the Capitol, including numerous former presidents, senators, and other officials. Other Americans lying in honor include Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, the two officers killed in the 1998 shooting incident. Chestnut was the first African American ever to lie in honor in the Capitol. The public also paid respect to Rosa Parks, an icon of the civil rights movement, at the Capitol in 2005. She was the first woman and second African American to lie in honor in the Capitol. In February 2018, the evangelical Rev. Billy Graham became the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the Rotunda.[60]\\r\\nOn September 24, 2015, Pope Francis gave a joint address to Congress, the first Pope to do so.[61]\\r\\nOn January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When President Andrew Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired. It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring.[62] Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including Davy Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.\\r\\nOn July 2, 1915, prior to the United States' entry into World War I, Eric Muenter (aka Frank Holt), a German professor who wanted to stop American support of the Allies of World War I, exploded a bomb in the reception room of the U.S. Senate. The next morning he tried to assassinate J. P. Morgan, Jr., son of the financier, at his home on Long Island, New York. In a letter to the Washington Evening Star published after the explosion, Muenter, writing under an assumed name, said he hoped that the detonation would \\"make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamor for war.\\" J.P. Morgan's company served as Great Britain's principal U.S. purchasing agent for munitions and other war supplies.\\r\\nIn 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire on members of Congress from the visitors' gallery, injuring five representatives. On March 1, 1971, a bomb exploded on the ground floor of the Capitol, placed by the radical left domestic terrorist group, the Weather Underground. They placed the bomb as a demonstration against U.S. involvement in Laos. On November 7, 1983, a group called the Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility for a bomb that detonated in the lobby outside the office of Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd.[63] Six people associated with the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee were later found in contempt of court for refusing to testify about the bombing.[64] In 1990, three members of the Armed Resistance Unit were convicted of the bombing, which they claimed was in response to the invasion of Grenada.[65] On July 24, 1998, Russell Eugene Weston Jr. burst into the Capitol and opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. The Capitol is believed to have been the intended target of the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, before it crashed near Shanksville in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after passengers tried to take over control of the plane from hijackers.[66][67]\\r\\nSince the September 11 attacks, the roads and grounds around the Capitol have undergone dramatic changes. The United States Capitol Police have also installed checkpoints to inspect vehicles at specific locations around Capitol Hill,[68][69] and have closed a section of one street indefinitely.[69] The level of screening employed varies. On the main east-west thoroughfares of Constitution and Independence Avenues, barricades are implanted in the roads that can be raised in the event of an emergency. Trucks larger than pickups are interdicted by the Capitol Police and are instructed to use other routes. On the checkpoints at the shorter cross streets, the barriers are typically kept in a permanent \\"emergency\\" position, and only vehicles with special permits are allowed to pass. All Capitol visitors are screened by a magnetometer, and all items that visitors may bring inside the building are screened by an x-ray device. In both chambers, gas masks are located underneath the chairs in each chamber for members to use in case of emergency.[citation needed] Structures ranging from scores of Jersey barriers to hundreds of ornamental bollards have been erected to obstruct the path of any vehicles that might stray from the designated roadways.[70]\\r\\nIn 2004 the capitol was briefly evacuated after a plane carrying the then governor of Kentucky strayed into restricted airspace over the district. A shooting incident occurred in March 2016. One female bystander was wounded by police but not seriously injured; a man pointing a gun was shot and arrested, in critical but stable condition.[71] The city police of Washington D.C. described the shooting incident as \\"isolated\\".[72]\\r\\nThe United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), located below the East Front of the Capitol and its plaza, between the Capitol building and 1st Street East, opened on December 2, 2008. The CVC provides a single security checkpoint for all visitors, including those with disabilities, and an expansion space[clarification needed] for the US Congress.[73][74] The complex contains 580,000 square feet (54,000?m2) of space below ground on three floors,[75] and offers visitors a food court, restrooms, and educational exhibits, including an 11-foot scale model of the Capitol dome.[76] It also features skylights affording views of the actual dome. Long in the planning stages, construction began in the fall of 2001, following the killing of two Capitol police officers in 1998. The estimated final cost of constructing the CVC was $621 million.[77]","input":"When was the u.s. capitol moved to washington d.c?"},{"output":"forty-two","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2018  was the 63rd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place for the first time in Portugal following the country's first victory at the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine with the song \\"Amar pelos dois\\", performed by Salvador Sobral. The contest was held at the Altice Arena in Lisbon, and consisted of two semi-finals on 8 and 10 May, and the final on 12 May 2018.[2] The three live shows were hosted by Filomena Cautela, Slvia Alberto, Daniela Ruah and Catarina Furtado.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-three countries participated in the contest, equalling the record of the 2008 and 2011 editions. Russia returned after their absence from the previous edition, and for the first time since 2011, no country withdrew from the contest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winner was Israel with the song \\"Toy\\", performed by Netta. This was Israel's fourth victory in the contest, following their wins in 1978, 1979, and 1998, and their first top five placing in more than a decade. This edition also saw Cyprus and the Czech Republic achieve the best placing in their Eurovision history, coming in second and sixth place, respectively. Portugal finished in the last place, making this the third time that the host country ranked in the bottom five since 2015. For the first time since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, Azerbaijan, Romania, and Russia failed to qualify for the final. No countries in the Caucasus region participated in the final for the first time since 2005. The EBU reported that the contest had a worldwide audience of around 186 million viewers, surpassing the 2017 edition by over 4 million.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contest took place for the first time in Portugal, following the country's victory in the 2017 edition with the song \\"Amar pelos dois\\", performed by Salvador Sobral.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Altice Arena in Lisbon is a multi-purpose indoor arena built for the Expo '98 and has a capacity of 20,000 attendees, making it the largest indoor venue in Portugal and among the largest in Europe.[5] It is located in the Parque das Na??es (Park of Nations) riverside district in the northeast of Lisbon, which was completely renovated to host the 1998 world's fair. It is connected by metro to the nearby international airport and by train (Oriente Station) to the rest of the country and Europe.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day of the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 final, it was reported that Portuguese broadcaster Rdio e Televis?o de Portugal (RTP) would accept the challenge of organising the 2018 contest in case of a victory.[7] Following Sobral's triumph, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)'s Executive Supervisor for the Eurovision Song Contest, Jon Ola Sand, issued the hosting invitation to RTP during the winner's press conference.[4] The following day, the director-general of RTP, Nuno Artur Silva, confirmed that the broadcaster would organise the contest in 2018 and mentioned MEO Arena (later renamed Altice Arena) in Lisbon as a likely venue to host the contest.[8] On 15 May 2017, RTP appeared to have confirmed Lisbon as the host city,[9][10] but clarified the following day that no final decision had been taken regarding both the host city and venue.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic requirements to select a host city were set out in a document presented by the EBU to RTP following their win in Kiev:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides Lisbon, other cities signalled their interest in bidding to host the 2018 contest: Braga, Espinho, Faro, Gondomar, Guimar?es, and Santa Maria da Feira.[13][14][15] The mayor of Porto, Rui Moreira, declared he would not be interested in \\"spending millions of euros\\" to host the contest,[11] but he would support a bid from the Metropolitan Area of Porto (Espinho, Gondomar, and Santa Maria da Feira).[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 June 2017, RTP representatives met with the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group at the EBU headquarters in Geneva. During the meeting, RTP officials attended a workshop covering several topics related with hosting the Eurovision Song Contest and learned from the experience of the Ukrainian broadcaster UA:PBC. They also had the opportunity to present their first plans for the 2018 contest, including multiple proposals for the host city and venue.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 July 2017, the EBU and RTP announced that Lisbon had been selected as the host city, overcoming confirmed bids from Braga, Gondomar, Guimar?es, and Santa Maria da Feira.[17] In addition, RTP indicated the Parque das Na??es, where Altice Arena is located, as the site for the shows.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nKey:\\r\\n???

It was located in Lisbon's downtown Pra?a do Comrcio (also called Terreiro do Pa?o), a large central square open to the Tagus river.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EuroClub was the venue for the official after-parties and private performances by contest participants. Unlike the Eurovision Village, access to the EuroClub was restricted to accredited fans, delegations, and press. It was located at the \\"Ministerium\\" club, next to the Eurovision Village.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Blue Carpet\\" event, where all the contestants and their delegations are presented before the accredited press and fans, took place on 6 May 2018 at the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT) in Lisbon's Belm district. This preceded the official Opening Ceremony of the 2018 contest, which took place at the nearby Electricity Museum.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme for the contest, All Aboard!, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 in a press conference held at the Lisbon Oceanarium.[37] Its visual design features oceanic motifs that allude to Lisbon and Portugal's location on the Atlantic coast and to the country's seafaring history. Alongside the main emblem, which depicts a stylised seashell, twelve supplemental emblems were designed to symbolise different aspects of a marine ecosystem. The contest's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand remarked that the theme and logos \\"resonate with Lisbon's history and underscore Eurovision's core values, including diversity, very well. The Ocean connects all of us and its variety can provide good inspiration for each of the participating broadcasters that we look forward to seeing in Lisbon next May.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 January 2018, RTP and EBU announced that the contest would be hosted for the first time by four female presenters, consisting of RTP hosts Slvia Alberto, Filomena Cautela, and Catarina Furtado, together with actress Daniela Ruah.[39] It will be the first time since 2015 that the contest does not feature a male presenter, and the second consecutive year that the presenters are all the same gender.[40][39] It was confirmed on 4 May 2018 that Cautela would host the green room.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blue Carpet opening ceremony was hosted by actress Cludia Semedo, radio host Ins Lopes Gon?alves, actor/TV host Pedro Granger, and actor/director Pedro Penim. Granger and Penim moderated the press conferences, as well.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe draw to determine the allocation of the participating countries into their respective semi-finals took place on 29 January 2018 at 13:00 CET, at Lisbon's City Hall. The thirty-seven semi-finalists had been allocated into six pots, based on historical voting patterns as calculated by the contest's official televoting partner Digame. Drawing from different pots helps to reduce the chance of so-called \\"bloc voting\\" and increase suspense in the semi-finals. The draw also determined which semi-final would be broadcast and voted by each of the six automatic finalist countries (hosts Portugal and Big Five countries France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). The ceremony was hosted by contest presenters Slvia Alberto and Filomena Cautela, and included the passing of a Eurovision insignia from Vitali Klitschko, the Mayor of Kiev (host city of the previous contest), to Fernando Medina, the Mayor of Lisbon.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nRTP released the first details regarding the opening and interval acts for the final on 12 March 2018. The opening act featured Portuguese fado singers Ana Moura and Mariza performing \\"Fado Loucura\\" and \\"Barco Negro\\", respectively, which was followed by a parade of flags introducing the 26 finalist participants, with live music by Portuguese scratching duo Beatbombers. The interval acts included Salvador Sobral, who performed his new single \\"Mano a mano\\" and his Eurovision-winning song \\"Amar pelos dois\\" (the latter in a duet with Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso), and electronic music performances by Branko featuring Sara Tavares (Portuguese representative in 1994), Mayra Andrade and Dino D'Santiago.[44][45][46][47][48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EBU announced on 7 November 2017 that forty-two countries would participate in the contest. Russia confirmed their return after withdrawing from the previous edition, while Macedonia's participation was provisionally blocked by the EBU due to unpaid debts by its national broadcaster.[38][50] However, ten days later, the EBU announced that Macedonia would be allowed to enter the contest, raising the number of participating countries to forty-three, equaling the highest number of participants with the 2008 and 2011 editions.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contest featured two representatives who also previously performed as lead vocalists for the same countries. Alexander Rybak won for Norway in 2009 performing \\"Fairytale\\" and Waylon placed second for the Netherlands in 2014 as part of The Common Linnets performing \\"Calm After the Storm\\".[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contest also featured Jessica Mauboy, representing Australia, after taking part in 2014 as the interval act for the second semi-final, performing \\"Sea of Flags\\".[53] In addition, the contest featured four lead singers previously participating as backing vocalists, two of them for the same countries. Lea Sirk backed for Slovenia in 2014 and off-stage in 2016,[54] and Equinox member Vlado Mihailov backed for Bulgaria in 2017.[55] Cesr Sampson, representing Austria, backed for Bulgaria in 2016 (also as a dancer) and off-stage in 2017.

He also confirmed that this version would be the one performed in Lisbon.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 April 2018, during the first rehearsal of the Czech Republic's performance, singer Mikolas Josef reportedly sustained injuries to his back while rehearsing and was subsequently rushed to hospital. The singer updated his fans on Instagram, stating \\"I can confirm that I got injured during the rehearsal and the situation got worse after several hours. I can't even walk now. Got back from the first hospital and I am now heading to another one\\". He stated that he would, however, \\"perform no matter what\\".[153] Josef performed in the first semi-final on 8 May with a slightly altered performance, owing to his injuries, and ultimately finished 6th in the Grand Final on 12 May, achieving Czech Republic's best result to date. He was also the second Czech contestant to qualify for the Grand Final, the other being Gabriela Gun?kov in 2016.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Chinese broadcast of the first semi-final on Mango TV, both Albania and Ireland were edited out of the show, along with their snippets in the recap of all 19 entries.[154] Albania was skipped due to a ban on television performers displaying tattoos that took effect in January 2018, while Ireland was censored due to its representation of a homosexual couple on-stage.[155] In addition, the LGBT flag and tattoos on other performers were also blurred out from the broadcast.[156] As a result, the EBU has terminated its partnership with Mango TV, citing that censorship \\"is not in line with the EBU's values of universality and inclusivity and its proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music,\\" which led to a ban on televising the second semi-final and the grand final in the country.[136][157] A spokesperson for the broadcaster's parent company Hunan TV said they \\"weren't aware\\" of the edits made to the programme.[158] Ireland's representative, Ryan O'Shaughnessy told the BBC in an interview, \\"they haven't taken this lightly and I think it's a move in the right direction, so I'm happy about it.\\"[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performance of SuRie, representing the United Kingdom, in the final was disrupted by a man who rushed onto the stage and grabbed her microphone, reportedly shouting \\"Modern Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom!

In 1972, Alcatraz became part of a national recreation area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\\r\\nToday, the island's facilities are managed by the National Park Service as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area; it is open to tours. Visitors can reach the island by ferry ride from Pier 33, near Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco. Hornblower Cruises and Events, operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises, is the official ferry provider to and from the island.\\r\\nAlcatraz Island is home to the abandoned prison, the site of the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States, early military fortifications, and natural features such as rock pools and a seabird colony (mostly western gulls, cormorants, and egrets). According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz, the island measures 1,675 feet (511?m) by 590 feet (180?m) and is 135 feet (41?m) at highest point during mean tide.[6] However, the total area of the island is reported to be 22 acres (8.9?ha).[2]\\r\\nLandmarks on the island include the Main Cellhouse, Dining Hall, Library, Lighthouse, the ruins of the Warden's House and Officers' Club, Parade Grounds, Building 64, Water Tower, New Industries Building, Model Industries Building, and the Recreation Yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Spaniard to document the island was Juan Manuel de Ayala in 1775, who charted San Francisco Bay and named one of the three islands he identified as the \\"La Isla de los Alcatraces,\\" which translates as \\"The Island of the Pelicans,\\"[1][7][8][9][10][11] from the archaic Spanish alcatraz (\\"pelican\\"). Over the years, the Spanish version \\"Alcatraz\\" became popular and is now widely used. In August 1827, French Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly wrote \\"... running past Alcatraze's (Pelicans) Island ... covered with a countless number of these birds. A gun fired over the feathered legions caused them to fly up in a great cloud and with a noise like a hurricane.\\"[12] The California brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus) is not known to nest on the island today. The Spanish built several small buildings on the island and other minor structures.[6]\\r\\nThe earliest recorded owner of the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by Mexican governor Pio Pico in June 1846, with the understanding that Workman would build a lighthouse on it.[13] Julian Workman is the baptismal name of William Workman, co-owner of Rancho La Puente and personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as Military Governor of California, John C. Frmont, champion of Manifest Destiny and leader of the Bear Flag Republic, bought the island for $5,000 in the name of the United States government from Francis Temple.[6][14][15][16] In 1850, President Millard Fillmore ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically as a United States military reservation,[10] for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the MexicanÿAmerican War.[17] Frmont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Frmont nothing. Frmont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s.[15][17]\\r\\nFollowing the acquisition of California by the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) which ended the MexicanÿAmerican War, and the onset of the California Gold Rush the following year, the U.S. Army began studying the suitability of Alcatraz Island for the positioning of coastal batteries to protect the approaches to San Francisco Bay. In 1853, under the direction of Zealous B. Tower, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began fortifying the island, work which continued until 1858, eventuating in Fortress Alcatraz. The island's first garrison at Camp Alcatraz, numbering about 200 soldiers and 11 cannons, arrived at the end of that year.\\r\\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the island mounted 85 cannons (increased to 105 cannons by 1866) in casemates around its perimeter, though the small size of the garrison meant only a fraction of the guns could be used at one time. At this time it also served as the San Francisco Arsenal for storage of firearms to prevent them falling into the hands of Confederate sympathizers.[18] Alcatraz, built as a \\"heavily fortified military site on the West Coast\\", formed a \\"triangle of defense\\" along with Fort Point and Lime Point, and ensured security to the bay. The island was also the site of the first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States.[10] Alcatraz never fired its guns offensively, though during the war it was used to imprison Confederate sympathizers and privateers on the west coast.[19]\\r\\nBecause of its isolation from the outside by the cold, strong, hazardous currents of the waters of San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz was used to house Civil War prisoners of war (POWs) as early as 1861.\\r\\nFollowing the war in 1866, the army determined the fortifications and guns were being rapidly rendered obsolete by advances in military technology. Modernization efforts, including an ambitious plan to level the entire island and construct shell-proof underground magazines and tunnels, were undertaken between 1870 and 1876 but never completed (the so-called \\"parade ground\\" on the southern tip of the island represents the extent of the flattening effort).[20] Instead, the army switched the focus of its plans for Alcatraz from coastal defense to detention, a task for which it was well suited because of its isolation. In 1867, a brick jailhouse was built (previously inmates had been kept in the basement of the guardhouse), and in 1868, Alcatraz was officially designated a long-term detention facility for military prisoners. The facility was later discontinued for POWs in 1946. Among those incarcerated at Alcatraz were Confederates caught on the West Coast,[6] and some Hopi Native American men in the 1870s.[21]\\r\\nIn 1898, the SpanishÿAmerican War increased the prison population from 26 to over 450, and from 1905 to 1907 it was commanded by U.S. Army General George W. McIver. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, civilian prisoners were transferred to Alcatraz for safe confinement. On March 21, 1907, Alcatraz was officially designated as the Western U.S. Military Prison, later Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, 1915.[18] In 1909 construction began on the huge concrete main cell block, designed by Major Reuben Turner, which remains the island's dominant feature. It was completed in 1912. To accommodate the new cell block, the Citadel, a three-story barracks, was demolished down to the first floor, which was actually below ground level. The building had been constructed in an excavated pit (creating a dry \\"moat\\") to enhance its defensive potential. The first floor was then incorporated as a basement to the new cell block, giving rise to the popular legend of \\"dungeons\\" below the main cell block. The Fortress was deactivated as a military prison in October 1933 and transferred to the Bureau of Prisons.[18]\\r\\nDuring World War I, the prison held conscientious objectors, including Philip Grosser, who wrote a pamphlet entitled Uncle Sam's Devil's Island about his experiences.[22]\\r\\nThe United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz was acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a federal prison in August 1934. Alcatraz was designed to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons.[23] At 9:40 am on August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas at Santa Venetia, California, before being escorted to Alcatraz, handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by some 60 special FBI agents, U.S. Marshals and railway security officials.[6][24] Most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and murderers.[6] The prison initially had a staff of 155, including the first warden James A. Johnston and associate warden J. E. Shuttleworth, both considered to be \\"iron men\\".[6] The staff were highly trained in security, but not rehabilitation.[6]\\r\\nDuring the 29 years it was in use, the jail held some of the most notorious criminals in American history,[6] such as Al Capone, Robert Franklin Stroud (the \\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\"), George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, Bumpy Johnson, Rafael Cancel Miranda (a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party who attacked the United States Capitol building in 1954),[25] Mickey Cohen, Arthur R. \\"Doc\\" Barker, James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, and Alvin \\"Creepy\\" Karpis (who served more time at Alcatraz than any other inmate). It also provided housing for the Bureau of Prisons staff and their families.\\r\\nDuring its 29 years of operation, the penitentiary claimed that no prisoner successfully escaped. A total of 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts, two men trying twice; 23 were caught alive, six were shot and killed during their escape, two drowned, and five are listed as \\"missing and presumed drowned\\".[26] The most violent occurred on May 2, 1946, when a failed escape attempt by six prisoners led to the Battle of Alcatraz.\\r\\nOn June 11, 1962, Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin carried out one of the most intricate escapes ever devised.\\r\\nBecause the penitentiary cost much more to operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per prisoner per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta),[27] and half a century of salt water saturation had severely eroded the buildings, then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered the penitentiary closed on March 21, 1963. In addition, citizens were increasingly protesting the environmental effects of sewage released into San Francisco Bay from the approximately 250 inmates and 60 Bureau of Prisons families on the island. That year, the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, on land, opened as the replacement facility for Alcatraz.\\r\\nAlcatraz Island was occupied by Native American activists for the first time on March 8, 1964. The event was reported by, among others, the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner.[citation needed]\\r\\nBeginning on November 20, 1969, a group of Native Americans called United Indians of All Tribes, mostly college students from San Francisco, occupied the island to protest federal policies related to American Indians. Some of them were children of Indians who had relocated in the city as part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Indian termination policy, which was a series of laws and policies aimed at the assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream American society, particularly by encouraging Indians to move away from the Indian reservations and into cities. A number of employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs also occupied Alcatraz at that time, including Doris Purdy, an amateur photographer, who later produced footage of her stay on the island.[28]\\r\\nThe occupiers, who stayed on the island for nearly two years, demanded the island's facilities be adapted and new structures built for an Indian education center, ecology center and cultural center. The American Indians claimed the island by provisions of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) between the U.S. and the Sioux; they said the treaty promised to return all retired, abandoned or out-of-use federal lands to the Native peoples from whom it was acquired. (Note: The Treaty of 1868 stated that all abandoned or unused federal land adjacent to the Great Sioux Reservation could be reclaimed by descendants of the Sioux Nation.) Indians of All Tribes then claimed Alcatraz Island by the \\"Right of Discovery\\", as indigenous peoples knew it thousands of years before any Europeans had come to North America. Begun by urban Indians of San Francisco, the occupation attracted other Native Americans from across the country, including American Indian Movement (AIM) urban activists from Minneapolis.\\r\\nThe Native Americans demanded reparation for the many treaties broken by the US government and for the lands which were taken from so many tribes. In discussing the Right of Discovery, the historian Troy R. Johnson states in The Occupation of Alcatraz Island, that indigenous peoples knew about Alcatraz at least 10,000 years before any European knew about any part of North America.\\r\\nDuring the nineteen months and nine days of occupation by the American Indians, several buildings at Alcatraz were damaged or destroyed by fire, including the recreation hall, the Coast Guard quarters and the warden's home. The origin of the fires is disputed. The U.S. government demolished a number of other buildings (mostly apartments) after the occupation had ended. Graffiti from the period of Native American occupation are still visible at many locations on the island.[29]\\r\\nDuring the occupation, President Richard Nixon rescinded the Indian termination policy, designed by earlier administrations to end federal recognition of tribes and their special relationship with the US government. He established a new policy of self-determination, in part as a result of the publicity and awareness created by the occupation. The occupation ended on June 11, 1971.[30]\\r\\nThe entire Alcatraz Island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976,[3] and was further declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.[4][31] In 1993, the National Park Service published a plan entitled Alcatraz Development Concept and Environmental Assessment.[32] This plan, approved in 1980, doubled the amount of Alcatraz accessible to the public to enable visitors to enjoy its scenery and bird, marine, and animal life.[33]\\r\\nToday, American Indigenous groups, such as the International Indian Treaty Council, hold ceremonies on the island, most notably, their \\"Sunrise Gatherings\\" every Columbus Day and Thanksgiving Day.\\r\\nThe Global Peace Foundation proposed to raze the prison and build a peace center in its place. During the previous year, supporters collected 10,350 signatures that placed it on the presidential primary ballots in San Francisco for February 5, 2008.[34] The proposed plan was estimated at $1 billion. For the plan to pass, Congress would have to have taken Alcatraz out of the National Park Service. Critics of the plan said that Alcatraz is too rich in history to be destroyed.[35] On February 6, 2008, the Alcatraz Island Global Peace Center Proposition C failed to pass, with 72% of voters rejecting the proposition.[36]\\r\\nRecently, Alcatraz has been home to several art installations. The famous Chinese artist/dissident Ai Weiwei staged an exhibition which explored \\"questions about human rights and freedom of expression\\" called @Large.[37] This 2014, exhibit included Lego portraits of famous political prisoners. In 2016, Nelson Saiers used math and prison slang as central elements in a six-month installation that addressed irrationally long prison sentences.[38][39]\\r\\nGardens planted by families of the original Army post, and later by families of the prison guards, fell into neglect after the prison closure in 1963. After 40 years, they are being restored by a paid staff member and many volunteers, thanks to funding by the Garden Conservancy and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. The untended gardens had become severely overgrown and had developed into a nesting habitat and sanctuary for numerous birds. Now, areas of bird habitat are being preserved and protected, while many of the gardens are being restored to their original state.\\r\\nIn clearing out the overgrowth, workers found that many of the original plants were growing where they had been planted ÿ some more than 100 years ago. Numerous heirloom rose hybrids, including a Welsh rose (Bardou Job) that had been believed to be extinct, have been discovered and propagated. Many species of roses, succulents, and geraniums are growing among apple and fig trees, banks of sweet peas, manicured gardens of cutting flowers, and wildly overgrown sections of native grasses with blackberry and honeysuckle.\\r\\nAlcatraz Island appears often in media and popular culture, including films dating from 1962: The Book of Eli (2010), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Rock (1996), Murder in the First (1995), Escape from Alcatraz (1979), The Enforcer (1976), Point Blank (1967) , Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) and J. J. Abrams' 2012 television series Alcatraz.\\r\\nIt also was featured in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime, in the book Al Capone Does My Shirts, in the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 as a playable level, and in the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops II in a downloadable zombie survival map called \\"Mob of the Dead\\". It is also featured as a playable racetrack in the 1996 arcade racing video game San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing. Alcatraz has also been portrayed often as a safe haven or base of operations in many post-apocalyptic movies, such as The Book of Eli.\\r\\nAlcatraz is featured in the episode \\"Bird Mummy of Alcatraz\\" in the children's program, Mummies Alive! and was also featured in a mission in the video game \\"Watch Dogs 2\\". Alcatraz has also been featured as a map in the game \\"The Escapists\\", as downloadable content","input":"What is the prison island in san francisco bay?"},{"output":"nuclear","context":"","input":"What kind of bomb was used in hiroshima?"},{"output":"New Zealand","context":"Apteryx haastii Great spotted kiwi\\r\\nApteryx owenii Little spotted kiwi\\r\\nApteryx rowi Okarito brown kiwi\\r\\nApteryx australis Southern brown kiwi\\r\\nApteryx mantelli North Island brown kiwi\\r\\nStictapteryx Iredale & Mathews, 1926\\r\\nKiwi Verheyen, 1960\\r\\nPseudapteryx Lydekker 1891\\r\\nKiwi (pronounced /ki?wi?/) or kiwis are flightless birds native to New Zealand, in the genus Apteryx and family Apterygidae. Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist of ostriches, emus, rheas, and cassowaries), and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world.[4]\\r\\nDNA sequence comparisons have yielded the surprising conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand.[5] There are five recognised species, two of which are currently endangered, another two of which are vulnerable, and one of which is near-threatened. All species have been negatively affected by historic deforestation but currently the remaining large areas of their forest habitat are well protected in reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators.\\r\\nThe kiwi is a national symbol of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi is used internationally as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mori language word kiwi (/?ki?wi?/ KEE-wee)[7] is generally accepted to be \\"of imitative origin\\" from the call.[8] However, some linguists derive the word from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *kiwi, which refers to Numenius tahitiensis, the bristle-thighed curlew, a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands.[9] With its long decurved bill and brown body, the curlew resembles the kiwi. So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the new-found bird.[10] The genus name Apteryx is derived from Ancient Greek \\"without wing\\": a-, \\"without\\" or \\"not\\"; pterux, \\"wing\\".[11]\\r\\nThe name is usually uncapitalised, with the plural either the anglicised \\"kiwis\\"[12] or, consistent with the Mori language, appearing as \\"kiwi\\" without an \\"-s\\".[13]\\r\\nAlthough it was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites, the moa, recent DNA studies have identified its closest relative as the extinct elephant bird of Madagascar,[5][14] and among extant ratites, the kiwi is more closely related to the emu and the cassowaries than to the moa.[5][15]\\r\\nResearch published in 2013 on an extinct genus, Proapteryx, known from the Miocene deposits of the Saint Bathans Fauna, found that it was smaller and probably capable of flight, supporting the hypothesis that the ancestor of the kiwi reached New Zealand independently from moas, which were already large and flightless by the time kiwi appeared.[16]\\r\\nThere are five known species of kiwi, as well as a number of subspecies.\\r\\nA. haastii\\r\\nA. owenii\\r\\nA. australis\\r\\nA. rowi\\r\\nA. mantelli\\r\\nRelationships in the genus Apteryx[17]\\r\\nTheir adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all the other ratites (ostrich, emu, rhea and cassowary), they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles. The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, like mammals and the young of other birds. With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements, brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as 450?g (16?oz). Like most other ratites, they have no uropygial gland (preen gland). Their bill is long, pliable and sensitive to touch, and their eyes have a reduced pecten. Their feathers lack barbules and aftershafts, and they have large vibrissae around the gape. They have 13 flight feathers, no tail and a small pygostyle. Their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow.[26]\\r\\nThe eye of the kiwi is the smallest relative to body mass in all avian species resulting in the smallest visual field as well. The eye has small specializations for its nocturnal lifestyle but relies on its other senses more heavily (auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory system). The sight of the kiwi is so underdeveloped that blind specimens have been observed in nature showing how little they rely on sight for survival and foraging. In an experiment, it was observed that one-third of a population of A. rowi in New Zealand under no environmental stress had ocular lesions in one or both eyes. The same experiment examined three specific specimens that showed complete blindness and found them to be in good physical standing outside of ocular abnormalities.[27]\\r\\nUnlike virtually every other palaeognath, which are generally small-brained by bird standards, kiwi have proportionally large encephalisation quotients. Hemisphere proportions are even similar to those of parrots and songbirds, though there is no evidence of similarly complex behaviour.[28]\\r\\nBefore the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier, New Zealand's only endemic mammals were three species of bat, and the ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles, insects and gastropods).[29]\\r\\nKiwi are shy and usually nocturnal. Their mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains.[26] Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them.[26] This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey but this has not been scientifically observed. Lab experiments have suggested that A. australis can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues.[30]\\r\\nOnce bonded, a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These relationships may last for up to 20?years.[31] They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.[26][32][33]) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter the weight of the female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world,[34] so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg.[35] The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white.[36] The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, A. haastii, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63ÿ92?days.[26] Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.[37]\\r\\nLice in the genus Apterygon[38][39][40] and in the subgenus Rallicola (Aptericola)[41][42] are exclusively ectoparasites of kiwi species.[43]\\r\\nNationwide studies show that, on average, only five percent of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood. However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint 1080 poison operation undertaken by DOC and the Animal Health Board in Tongariro Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged. 57% of the radio-tagged chicks survived to adulthood. Thanks to ongoing pest control, the adult kiwi population at Tongariro has almost doubled since 1998.\\r\\nIn 2000, the Department of Conservation set up five kiwi sanctuaries focused on developing methods to protect kiwi and to increase their numbers.\\r\\nA number of other mainland conservation islands and fenced sanctuaries have significant populations of kiwi, including:\\r\\nNorth island brown kiwi were introduced to the Cape Sanctuary in Hawke's Bay between 2008 and 2011, which in turn provided captive-raised chicks that were released back into Maungataniwha Native Forest.[44]\\r\\nOperation Nest Egg is a programme run by the BNZ Save the Kiwi Trusta partnership between the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselvesusually when they weigh around 1200?grams (42?ounces). They are then returned to the wild. An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65% chance of surviving to adulthoodcompared to just 5% for wild-hatched and raised chicks.[45] The tool is used on all kiwi species except little spotted kiwi.\\r\\nIn 2004, anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned. An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public.[46] He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap. Extensive monitoring shows that kiwi are not at risk from the use of biodegradable 1080 poison.[47]\\r\\nIntroduced mammalian predators, namely stoats, dogs, ferrets, and cats, are the number one threat to kiwi. Other threats include habitat modification/loss and motor vehicle strike. The restricted distribution and small size of some kiwi populations increases their vulnerability to inbreeding.\\r\\nStoats are responsible for approximately half of kiwi chick deaths in many areas through New Zealand. Cats also to a lesser extent prey on kiwi chicks. Research has shown that the combined effect of predators and other mortality (accidents etc.) results in less than 5% of kiwi chicks surviving to adulthood.[48] Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about 1ÿ1.2?kg in weight, at which time they can usually defend themselves.\\r\\nFerrets and dogs often kill adult kiwi. These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations. In particular, dogs find the distinctive strong scent of kiwi irresistible and easy to track, such that they can catch and kill kiwi in seconds. Motor vehicle strike is a threat to all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat. Badly set possum traps often kill or maim kiwi.[49]\\r\\nThe Mori traditionally believed that kiwi were under the protection of Tane Mahuta, god of the forest. They were used as food and their feathers were used for kahu kiwiceremonial cloaks.[50] Today, while kiwi feathers are still used, they are gathered from birds that die naturally or through road accidents or predation, or from captive birds.[51] Kiwi are no longer hunted and some Maori consider themselves the birds' guardians.[10]\\r\\nIn 1813, George Shaw named the genus Apteryx in his species description of the southern brown kiwi, which he called \\"the southern apteryx\\". Captain Andrew Barclay of the ship Providence provided Shaw with the specimen. Shaw's description was accompanied by two plates, engraved by Frederick Polydore Nodder; they were published in volume 24 of The Naturalist's Miscellany.[52]\\r\\nIn 1851, London Zoo became the first zoo to keep kiwi. The first captive breeding took place in 1945.[53] As of 2007 only 13 zoos outside New Zealand hold kiwi.[54] The Frankfurt Zoo has 12, the Berlin Zoo has seven, Walsrode Bird Park has one, the Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands has three, the San Diego Zoo has five, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park has one, the National Zoo in Washington, DC has eleven, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has one, and the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has three.[55][56]\\r\\nThe kiwi as a symbol first appeared in the late 19th century in New Zealand regimental badges. It was later featured in the badges of the South Canterbury Battalion in 1886 and the Hastings Rifle Volunteers in 1887. Soon after, the kiwi appeared in many military badges; and in 1906, when Kiwi Shoe Polish was widely sold in the UK and the US, the symbol became more widely known.[57]\\r\\nDuring the First World War, the name \\"kiwi\\" for New Zealand soldiers came into general use, and a giant kiwi (now known as the Bulford kiwi), was carved on the chalk hill above Sling Camp in England. Usage has become so widespread that all New Zealanders overseas and at home are now commonly referred to as \\"Kiwis\\".[58]\\r\\nThe kiwi has since become the most well-known national symbol for New Zealand, and the bird is prominent in the coat of arms, crests and badges of many New Zealand cities, clubs and organisations; at the national level, the red silhouette of a kiwi is in the centre of the roundel of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.[36][59] The kiwi is featured in the logo of the New Zealand Rugby League, and the New Zealand national rugby league team are nicknamed the Kiwis.\\r\\nThe reverse of a New Zealand dollar coin contains an image of a kiwi, and in currency trading the New Zealand dollar is often referred to as \\"the kiwi\\".[60]","input":"In what country do you find the kivi?"},{"output":"Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin)","context":"The extreme points of India include the coordinates that are further north, south, east or west than any other location in India; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country.

The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. The second phase consisted of large-scale ground combat (supported by a massive air war considered to be an additional front), which began in June 1944 with the Allied landings in Normandy and continued until the defeat of Germany in May 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoney War was an early phase of World War II marked by a few military operations in Continental Europe in the months following the German invasion of Poland and preceding the Battle of France. Although the great powers of Europe had declared war on one another, neither side had yet committed to launching a significant attack, and there was relatively little fighting on the ground. This was also the period in which the United Kingdom and France did not supply significant aid to Poland, despite their pledged alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most of the German Army was fighting against Poland, a much smaller German force manned the Siegfried Line, their fortified defensive line along the French border. At the Maginot Line on the other side of the border, French troops stood facing them, whilst the British Expeditionary Force and other elements of the French Army created a defensive line along the Belgian border. There were only some local, minor skirmishes. The British Royal Air Force dropped propaganda leaflets on Germany and the first Canadian troops stepped ashore in Britain, while Western Europe was in a strange calm for seven months.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their hurry to re-arm, Britain and France had both begun to buy large numbers of weapons from manufacturers in the United States at the outbreak of hostilities, supplementing their own production. The non-belligerent United States contributed to the Western Allies by discounted sales of military equipment and supplies. German efforts to interdict the Allies' trans-Atlantic trade at sea ignited the Battle of the Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Western Front remained quiet in April 1940, the fighting between the Allies and the Germans began in earnest with the Norwegian Campaign when the Germans launched Operation Weserbung, the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. In doing so, the Germans beat the Allies to the punch; the Allies had been planning an amphibious landing in which they could begin to surround Germany, cutting off her supply of raw materials from Sweden. However, when the Allies made a counter-landing in Norway following the German invasion, the Germans repulsed them and defeated the Norwegian armed forces, driving the latter into exile. The Kriegsmarine, nonetheless, suffered very heavy losses during the two-months of fighting required to seize all of mainland Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1940, the Germans launched the Battle of France. The Western Allies (primarily the French, Belgian and British land forces) soon collapsed under the onslaught of the so-called \\"blitzkrieg\\" strategy. The majority of the British and elements of the French forces escaped at Dunkirk. With the fighting ended, the Germans began to consider ways of resolving the question of how to deal with Britain. If the British refused to agree to a peace treaty, one option was to invade. However, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, had suffered serious losses in Norway, and in order to even consider an amphibious landing, Germany's Air Force (the Luftwaffe) had to first gain air superiority or air supremacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Luftwaffe unable to defeat the RAF in the Battle of Britain, the invasion of Great Britain could no longer be thought of as an option. While the majority of the German army was mustered for the invasion of the Soviet Union, construction began on the Atlantic Wall ÿ a series of defensive fortifications along the French coast of the English Channel. These were built in anticipation of an Allied invasion of France.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the massive logistical obstacles a cross-channel invasion would face, Allied high command decided to conduct a practice attack against the French coast. On 19?August  1942, the Allies began the Dieppe Raid, an attack on Dieppe, France. Most of the troops were Canadian, with some British contingents and a small American and Free French presence along with British and Polish naval support. The raid was a disaster, almost two-thirds of the attacking force became casualties. However, much was learned as a result of the operation ÿ these lessons would be put to good use in the subsequent invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor almost two years, there was no land-fighting on the Western Front with the exception of commando raids and the guerrilla actions of the resistance aided by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and Office of Strategic Services (OSS). However, in the meantime, the Allies took the war to Germany, with a strategic bombing campaign the US Eighth Air Force bombing Germany by day and RAF Bomber Command bombing by night. The bulk of the Allied armies were occupied in the Mediterranean, seeking to clear the sea lanes to the Indian Ocean and capture the Foggia Airfield Complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo early British raids for which battle honours were awarded were Operations Collar in Boulogne (24?June 1940) and Ambassador in Guernsey (14ÿ15?July 1940). The raids for which the British awarded the  \\"North-West Europe Campaign of 1942\\" battle honour were:  Operation Biting ÿ Bruneval (27ÿ28?February 1942), St Nazaire (27ÿ28?March 1942), Operation Myrmidon ÿ Bayonne (5?April 1942), Operation Abercrombie ÿ Hardelot (21ÿ22?April 1942), Dieppe (19?August 1942) and Operation  ÿ Frankton ÿ Gironde (7ÿ12?December 1942).[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nA raid on Sark on the night of 3/4?October 1942 is notable because a few days after the incursion the Germans issued a propaganda communiqu implying at least one prisoner had escaped and two were shot while resisting having their hands tied. This instance of tying prisoner's hands contributed to Hitler's decision to issue his Commando Order instructing that all captured Commandos or Commando-type personnel were to be executed as a matter of procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the summer of 1944, when expectation of an Allied invasion was freely admitted by German commanders, the disposition of troops facing it came under the command of OB West (HQ in Paris). In turn it commanded three groups: the Wehrmacht Netherlands Command (Wehrmachtbefehlshaber#Niederlande) or WBN, covering the Dutch and Belgian coasts and Army Group B, covering the coast of northern France with the German 15th Army (HQ in Tourcoing), in the area north of the Seine; the 7th Army, (HQ in Le Mans), between the Seine and the Loire defending the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, and Army Group G with responsibility for the Bay of Biscay coast and Vichy France, with its 1st Army, (HQ in Bordeaux), responsible for the Atlantic coast between the Loire and the Spanish border and the 19th Army, (HQ in Avignon), responsible for the Mediterranean coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not possible to predict where the Allies might choose to launch their invasion. The chance of an amphibious landing necessitated the substantial dispersal of the German mobile reserves, which contained the majority of their panzer troops. Each army group was allocated its mobile reserves. Army Group?B had the 2nd Panzer Division in northern France, 116th Panzer Division in the Paris area, and the 21st Panzer Division in Normandy. Army Group?G, considering the possibility of an invasion on the Atlantic coast, had dispersed its mobile reserves, locating the 11th Panzer Division in Gironde, the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich refitting around the southern French town of Montauban, and the 9th Panzer Division stationed in the Rhone delta area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OKW retained a substantial reserve of such mobile divisions also, but these were dispersed over a large area: the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler was still forming and training in the Netherlands, the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and the Panzer-Lehr Division were located in the Paris-Orleans area, since the Normandy coastal defence sectors or (Kstenverteitigungsabschnitte ÿ KVA) were considered the most likely areas for an invasion. The 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G?tz von Berlichingen was located just south of the Loire in the vicinity of Tours.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 June 1944, the Allies began Operation Overlord (also known as \\"D-Day\\") ÿ the long-awaited liberation of France. The deception plans, Operations Fortitude and Bodyguard, had the Germans convinced that the invasion would occur in the Pas-de-Calais, while the real target was Normandy. Following two months of slow fighting in hedgerow country, Operation Cobra allowed the Americans to break out at the western end of the lodgement. Soon after, the Allies were racing across France. They encircled around 200,000 Germans in the Falaise Pocket. As had so often happened on the Eastern Front Hitler refused to allow a strategic withdrawal until it was too late. Approximately 150,000 Germans were able to escape from the Falaise pocket, but they left behind most of their irreplaceable equipment and 50,000 Germans were killed or taken prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies had been arguing about whether to advance on a broad-front or a narrow-front from before D-Day.[36] If the British had broken out of the Normandy bridgehead (or beachhead) around Caen when they launched Operation Goodwood and pushed along the coast, facts on the ground might have turned the argument in favour of a narrow front. However, as the breakout took place during Operation Cobra at the western end of the bridge-head, the 21st Army Group that included the British and Canadian forces swung east and headed for Belgium, the Netherlands and Northern Germany, while the U.S. Twelfth Army Group advanced to their south via eastern France, Luxembourg and the Ruhr Area, rapidly fanning out into a broad front. As this was the strategy favoured by the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and most of the American high command, it was soon adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 August the Allies launched Operation Dragoon ÿ the invasion of Southern France between Toulon and Cannes. The US Seventh Army and the French First Army, making up the US 6th Army Group, rapidly consolidated this beachhead and liberated southern France in two weeks; they then moved north up the Rhone valley. Their advance only slowed down as they encountered regrouped and entrenched German troops in the Vosges Mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans in France were now faced by three powerful Allied army groups: in the north the British 21st Army Group commanded by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, in the center the American 12th Army Group, commanded by General Omar Bradley and to the south the US 6th Army Group commanded by Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. By mid-September, the 6th Army Group, advancing from the south, came into contact with Bradley's formations advancing from the west and overall control of Devers' force passed from AFHQ in the Mediterranean so that all three army groups came under Eisenhower's central command at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the onslaught in both the north and south of France, the German Army fell back. On 19 August, the French Resistance (FFI) organised a general uprising and the liberation of Paris took place on 25?August when general Dietrich von Choltitz accepted the French ultimatum and surrendered to general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, commander of the Free French 2nd Armored Division, ignoring orders from Hitler that Paris should be held to the last and destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liberation of northern France and the Benelux countries was of special significance for the inhabitants of London and the southeast of England, because it denied the Germans launch sites for their mobile V-1 and V-2 Vergeltungswaffen (reprisal weapons).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Allies advanced across France, their supply lines stretched to breaking point. The Red Ball Express, the Allied trucking effort, was simply unable to transport enough supplies from the port facilities in Normandy all the way to the front line, which by September, was close to the German border.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor German units in the French southwest that had not been committed in Normandy withdrew, either eastwards towards Alsace (sometimes directly across the US 6th Army Group's advance) or into the ports with the intention of denying them to the Allies. These latter groups were not thought worth much effort and were left \\"to rot\\", with the exception of Bordeaux, which was liberated in May 1945 by French forces under General Edgard de Larminat (Operation Venerable).[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFighting on the Western front seemed to stabilize, and the Allied advance stalled in front of the Siegfried Line (Westwall) and the southern reaches of the Rhine. Starting in early September, the Americans began slow and bloody fighting through the Hurtgen Forest (\\"Passchendaele with tree bursts\\"Hemingway) to breach the Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe port of Antwerp was liberated on 4 September by the British 11th Armoured Division. However, it lay at the end of the long Scheldt Estuary, and so it could not be used until its approaches were clear of heavily fortified German positions. The Breskens pocket on the southern bank of the Scheldt was cleared with heavy casualties by Canadian and Polish forces in Operation Switchback, during the Battle of the Scheldt. This was followed by a tedious campaign to clear a peninsula dominating the estuary, and finally, the amphibious assault on Walcheren Island in November. The campaign to clear the Scheldt Estuary was a decisive victory for the First Canadian Army and the rest of the Allies, as it allowed a greatly improved delivery of supplies directly from Antwerp, which was far closer to the front than the Normandy beaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October the Americans decided that they could not just invest Aachen and let it fall in a slow siege, because it threatened the flanks of the U.S. Ninth Army.  As it was the first major German city to face capture, Hitler ordered that the city be held at all costs. In the resulting battle, the city was taken, at a cost of 5,000 casualties on both sides, with an additional 5,600 German prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of the Ardennes, American forces fought from September until mid-December to push the Germans out of Lorraine and from behind the Siegfried Line. The crossing of the Moselle River and the capture of the fortress of Metz proved difficult for the American troops in the face of German reinforcements, supply shortages, and unfavorable weather. During September and October, the Allied 6th?Army Group (U.S. Seventh Army and French First Army) fought a difficult campaign through the Vosges Mountains that was marked by dogged German resistance and slow advances. In November, however, the German front snapped under the pressure, resulting in sudden Allied advances that liberated Belfort, Mulhouse, and Strasbourg, and placed Allied forces along the Rhine River. The Germans managed to hold a large bridgehead (the Colmar Pocket), on the western bank of the Rhine and centered around the city of Colmar. On 16 November the Allies started a large scale autumn offensive called Operation Queen. With its main thrust again through the Hrtgen Forest, the offensive drove the Allies to the Rur River, but failed in its core objectives to capture the Rur dams and pave the way towards the Rhine. The Allied operations were then succeeded by the German Ardennes offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nField Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, persuaded the Allied High Command to launch a bold attack, Operation Market Garden, which he hoped would get the Allies across the Rhine and create the narrow-front he favoured. Airborne troops would fly in from the United Kingdom and take bridges over the main rivers of the German-occupied Netherlands in three main cities; Eindhoven, Nijmegen, and Arnhem. The British XXX Corps would punch through the German lines along the Maas-Schelde Kanal and link up with the airborne troops of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division in Eindhoven, the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division at Nijmegen and the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem. If all went well XXX Corps would advance into Germany without any remaining major obstacles. XXX Corps was able to advance beyond six of the seven airborne-held bridges, but was unable to link up with the troops near the bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem. The result was the near-destruction of the British 1st Airborne Division during the Battle of Arnhem, which  sustained almost 8,000 casualties. The offensive ended with Arnhem remaining in German hands and the Allies holding an extended salient from the Belgian border to the area between Nijmegen and Arnhem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans had been preparing a massive counter-attack in the West since the Allied breakout from Normandy. The plan called Wacht am Rhein (\\"Watch on the Rhine\\") was to attack through the Ardennes and swing north to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16?December in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the US First Army. Initial successes in bad weather, which gave them cover from the Allied air forces, resulted in a German penetration of over 80?km (50?mi) to within less than 16?km (10?mi) of the Meuse. Having been taken by surprise, the Allies regrouped and the Germans were stopped by a combined air and land counter-attack which eventually pushed them back to their starting points by 25?January 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans launched a second, smaller offensive (Nordwind) into Alsace on 1 January 1945. Aiming to recapture Strasbourg, the Germans attacked the 6th?Army Group at multiple points. Because the Allied lines had become severely stretched in response to the crisis in the Ardennes, holding and throwing back the Nordwind offensive was a costly affair that lasted almost four weeks. The culmination of Allied counter-attacks restored the front line to the area of the German border and collapsed the Colmar Pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1945 the German bridgehead over the river Roer between Heinsberg and Roermond was cleared during Operation Blackcock, followed by the pincer movement of the First Canadian Army in Operation Veritable advancing from the Nijmegen area of the Netherlands and the US Ninth Army crossing the Rur (Roer) in Operation Grenade was planned to start on 8 February 1945, but it was delayed by two weeks when the Germans flooded the river valley by destroying the dam gates upstream. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt requested permission to withdraw east behind the Rhine, arguing that  further resistance would only delay the inevitable, but was ordered by Hitler to fight where his forces stood.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time the water had subsided and the US Ninth Army was able to cross the Roer on 23 February, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine's west bank. Von Rundstedt's divisions which had remained on the west bank, were cut to pieces in the 'battle of the Rhineland', ÿ 280,000 men were taken prisoner. With a large number of men captured, the stubborn German resistance during the Allied campaign to reach the Rhine in February and March 1945 had been costly. Total losses reached an estimated 400,000 men.[38] By the time they prepared to cross the Rhine in late March, the Western Allies had taken 1,300,000 German soldiers prisoner in western Europe.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Allies had crossed the Rhine, the British fanned out northeast towards Hamburg crossing the river Elbe and on towards Denmark and the Baltic. British forces captured Bremen on 26 April after a week of combat.[43] British and Canadian paratroopers reached the Baltic city of Wismar just ahead of Soviet forces on 2?May. The US Ninth Army, which had remained under British command since the battle of the Bulge, went south as the northern pincer of the Ruhr encirclement as well as pushing elements east. XIX Corps of the Ninth Army captured Magdeburg on 18 April and the US XIII Corps to the north occupied Stendal.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US 12th Army Group fanned out, the First Army went north as the southern pincer of the Ruhr encirclement. On 4 ?April the encirclement was completed and the Ninth Army reverted to the command of Bradley's 12th?Army Group. The German Army Group B commanded by Field Marshal Walther Model was trapped in the Ruhr Pocket and 300,000 soldiers became POWs. The Ninth and First American armies then turned east and pushed to the Elbe river by mid-April. During the push east, the cities of Frankfurt am Main, Kassel, Magdeburg, Halle and Leipzig were strongly defended by ad hoc German garrisons made up of regular troops, Flak units, Volkssturm and armed Nazi Party auxiliaries. Generals Eisenhower and Bradley concluded that pushing beyond the Elbe made no sense since eastern Germany was destined in any case to be occupied by the Red Army. The First and Ninth Armies stopped along the Elbe and Mulde rivers, making contact with Soviet forces near the Elbe in late April. The US Third Army had fanned out to the east into western Czechoslovakia and southeast into eastern Bavaria and northern Austria. By V-E Day, the US 12th?Army Group was a force of four armies (First, Third, Ninth and Fifteenth) that numbered over 1.3?million men.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US 6th Army Group fanned out to the southwest, passing to the east of Switzerland through Bavaria and into Austria and northern Italy.[when?] The Black Forest and Baden were overrun by the French First Army.[when?] Determined stands were made in April by German forces at Heilbronn, Nuremberg, and Munich but were overcome after several days.[when?] Elements of the US 3rd Infantry Division were the first Allied troops to arrive at Berchtesgaden, which they secured, while the French 2nd Armoured Division seized the Berghof (Hitler's Alpine residence) on 4?May 1945. German Army Group?G surrendered to US forces at Haar, in Bavaria, on 5?May. Field Marshal Montgomery took the German military surrender of all German forces in The Netherlands, northwest Germany and Denmark on Lneburg Heath, an area between the cities of Hamburg, Hanover and Bremen, on 4?May 1945. As the operational commander of some of these forces[vague][clarification needed] was Grand Admiral Karl D?nitz, the new Reichspr?sident (head of state) of the Third Reich this signaled that the European war was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 May at his headquarters in Rheims, Eisenhower took the unconditional surrender of all German forces to the western Allies and the Soviet Union,[46] from the German Chief-of-Staff, General Alfred Jodl, who signed the first general instrument of surrender at 0241 hours. General Franz B?hme announced the unconditional surrender of German troops in Norway. Operations ceased at 2301 hours Central European time (CET) on 8 May. On that same day Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, as head of OKW and Jodl's superior, was brought to Marshal Georgy Zhukov in Karlshorst and signed another instrument of surrender that was essentially identical to that signed in Rheims with two minor additions requested by the Soviets.[47]","input":"What event began the second front in world war ii?"},{"output":"February 7, 2010","context":"Drew Christopher Brees (/?bri?z/;[1]) (born January 15, 1979) is an American football quarterback for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). After a prolific college football career at Purdue University, he was chosen by the San Diego Chargers with the first pick in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He left college as one of the most-decorated players in Purdue and Big Ten Conference history, establishing two NCAA records, 13 Big Ten Conference records and 19 Purdue University records.[2] As of 2016, he remains the Big Ten record-holder in virtually every passing category, including completions (1,026), yards (11,792), and touchdowns (90).\\r\\nBrees started his professional career with the San Diego Chargers, earning the starting job in 2002 and making the Pro Bowl in 2004. Nine months after suffering a bad dislocation in his shoulder joint and a 360 degree tear of his labrum and rotator cuff, Brees signed with the New Orleans Saints as a free agent.[3] He met immediate success in New Orleans, earning nine trips to the Pro Bowl and leading the Saints to their first Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLIV, a 31ÿ17 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Since joining the Saints in 2006, he has led all NFL quarterbacks in touchdowns, passing yards, and 300-yard games. Brees has passed for over 5,000 yards in a season five timesno other NFL quarterback has done so more than once. He has led the NFL in passing touchdowns four times, and in passing yards a record seven times. He was the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year in 2004, the Offensive Player of the Year in 2008 and 2011, and the MVP of Super Bowl XLIV. Sports Illustrated named Brees its 2010 Sportsman of the Year.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrees was born to Eugene Wilson \\"Chip\\" Brees II, a prominent trial lawyer, and Mina Ruth (ne Akins; died 2009), an attorney. A Sports Illustrated article stated he was named for Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Drew Pearson[5] but in a 2014 interview Brees said this story was \\"just legend\\".[6] He has a younger brother, Reid (born 1981). When Brees was seven, his parents divorced and shared custody of the boys, who split their time between both parents' homes. Today, Brees admits that it was a very tough and challenging life after the divorce; however, Brees and his younger brother, Reid, supported each other and became very close.[7] They have a younger half-sister, Audrey, from their father's remarriage to Amy Hightower, daughter of the late U.S. Representative (D-TX) Jack English Hightower.[8][9]\\r\\nBoth of Brees's parents had athletic backgrounds. His father played basketball for the Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball team, and his mother was a former all-state in three sports in high school.[10] His maternal uncle, Marty Akins, was an All-American starting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns college football team from 1975 to 1977.[9][11] and his maternal grandfather, Ray Akins, had the third-most victories as a Texas high school football coach in his three decades at Gregory-Portland High School.[12][13][14] His younger brother, Reid, was an outfielder for the Baylor Bears baseball team, which made the 2005 College World Series and now resides in Colorado, where he works in sales.[11][15]\\r\\nBrees did not play \\"tackle football\\" until high school and was on the flag football team at St. Andrew's Episcopal School, where his teammates included actor Benjamin McKenzie, who was in the same year. In high school, he was a varsity letterman in baseball, basketball and football[16] and was considering playing college baseball rather than football.[17] College recruiters quickly ran after Brees blew out his knee in the 11th grade.[7] After overcoming an ACL tear during his junior year he was selected as Texas High School 5A Most Valuable Offensive Player in 1996 and led the Westlake High School football team to 16ÿ0 record and state championship.[9][18] As a high school football player, Brees completed 314 of 490 passes (64.1 percent) for 5,461 yards with 50 touchdowns including, in his senior season, 211 of 333 passes (63.4 percent) for 3,528 yards with 31 touchdowns.[19] Westlake went 28ÿ0ÿ1 when Brees started for two seasons and beat a Dominic Rhodes-led Abilene Cooper 55ÿ15 in the 1996 title game.[12][19][20] Brees was given honorable mention in the state high school all-star football team and the USA Today All-USA high school football team.[21] alongside former San Diego Chargers teammate and long-time friend LaDainian Tomlinson[8][22][23] Brees had hoped to follow his father and uncle's footsteps and play for the Texas Longhorns or Texas A&M Aggies but was not heavily recruited despite his stellar record.[9][24]\\r\\nBrees received offers from only two colleges, Purdue and Kentucky, choosing Purdue for its highly rated academics.[10] He graduated in 2001 with a degree in industrial management,[25] and is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.[26]\\r\\nAfter a relatively uneventful freshman season, Brees was given his first start during his sophomore year by Boilermakers head coach Joe Tiller and became an integral part of Tiller and Jim Chaney's unorthodox \\"basketball on grass\\" spread offense, serving as offensive captain during his junior and senior years.[27][28] He had the option to make himself available for the 2000 NFL Draft but chose to return for his senior year to complete his studies. In 2000, he led the Boilermakers to memorable last-minute upsets against top-ranked Ohio State[29] and Michigan en route to the Boilermakers' first Big Ten championship (shared with Michigan and Northwestern) in over three decades. The Ohio State game was replayed on ESPN Classic and is widely remembered for Brees's four interceptions and 64-yard touchdown pass to Seth Morales with 1:55 remaining to seal a vital 31ÿ27 win, prompting commentator Brent Musburger to exclaim \\"Holy Toledo!\\" and a post-game field rush afterwards.[30][31][32] Due to head-to-head victories over Michigan and Northwestern, Purdue won the invitation to the 2001 Rose Bowl,[33] Purdue's first appearance there since 1967, where Purdue lost by ten points to the Washington Huskies.\\r\\nBrees was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award as the nation's best quarterback in 1999. He won the Maxwell Award as the nation's outstanding player of 2000[34] and the NCAA's Today's Top VIII Award as a member of the Class of 2001.[35] Brees was also fourth in Heisman Trophy voting in 1999 and third in 2000. As a senior, Brees became the first Boilermaker since Bruce Brineman in 1989 to earn Academic All-America honors.[36][37][38][39] Additionally, he won Academic All-Big Ten honors a record three times,[40] was initiated into Mortar Board[37] and awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor[41] and the NFF National Scholar-Athlete Award.[42][43] Brees also was awarded Purdue's Leonard Wilson Award for unselfishness and dedication.[44]\\r\\nBrees left Purdue with Big Ten Conference records in passing yards (11,792),[16] touchdown passes (90), total offensive yards (12,693), completions (1,026), and attempts (1,678).[27] He tied an NCAA record with the longest pass ever (99 yards), to receiver Vinny Sutherland against Northwestern on September 25, 1999 and held the NCAA record for pass attempts in a game (83) for fifteen years, until Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday broke it in October 2013.\\r\\nIn 2009 Brees was inducted into Purdue's Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.[45] The Big Ten Conference's GrieseÿBrees Quarterback of the Year award initiated in 2011 was named in his and Bob Griese's honor. He was named the Big Ten's best quarterback of the 1990s[46] and ranked number 48 on the 2010 documentary Big Ten Icons, featuring the conference's top fifty student-athletes.[47][48][49]\\r\\nBrees's college success led to projections that he would be a midÿlate first-round draft pick in the 2001 NFL Draft,[50] but he slipped due to concerns about his relatively short stature for a professional quarterback (6'), a perceived lack of arm strength, and a sense that he had succeeded in college in a spread offense. Brees was the second quarterback, behind Michael Vick of Virginia Tech, selected in the 2001 Draft, chosen by the San Diego Chargers as the first pick of the second round and 32nd overall.[51] San Diego originally had the first pick in that draft, but traded it to Atlanta (which had drafted Vick) in return for the fifth pick of the first round, with which San Diego drafted LaDainian Tomlinson.[51]\\r\\nBrees played in his first professional game on November 4, 2001 against the Kansas City Chiefs. He won the starting job over Doug Flutie during training camp before the start of the 2002 season. Brees started all 16 games for the Chargers during the 2002 season, leading the team to an 8ÿ8 record. After a disappointing start to the 2003 season, he was replaced by Flutie, though he regained the job by the end of the season.\\r\\nBrees's career with the Chargers was in jeopardy after San Diego acquired NC State's Philip Rivers after the 2004 NFL Draft. With a looming quarterback controversy, Brees performed well through training camp and the preseason, while Rivers held out during training camp, essentially guaranteeing him the job to begin the season with Rivers as his backup.\\r\\nBrees remained the starter throughout the 2004 season, where he started 15 games and led the team to a 12ÿ4 regular season record. Brees posted spectacular numbers, completing 65.5% of his passes for 3,159 yards, with 27 touchdowns to only 7 interceptions, giving him a 104.8 passer rating. The Chargers won the AFC West for the first time in 10 seasons and Brees was selected to the 2004 Pro Bowl.[52] He was named 2004 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.[53]\\r\\nBrees became a free agent after the season and was not expected to return to San Diego, which had already committed a large sum of money to Rivers. The team eventually designated Brees a franchise player, giving him a one-year contract that quadrupled his pay to $8 million for 2005. Under the terms of the franchise player contract, Brees was eligible to be traded or to sign with another team, but the Chargers would receive two future first round draft choices in return. He was not traded and continued as the starting quarterback for the remainder of the 2005 season.[54]\\r\\nBrees continued his productive play in 2005, as he posted a career-high in passing yards with 3,576. Brees also posted an 89.2 rating, 10th best in the NFL. However, in the last game of the 2005 season against the Denver Broncos, Brees tore his labrum while trying to pick up his own fumble after being hit by Broncos safety John Lynch. Denver tackle Gerard Warren hit Brees while he was on the ground, causing the injury. Brees underwent arthroscopic surgery, performed by Dr. James Andrews, to repair the torn labrum in his right (throwing) shoulder on January 5, 2006. Subsequent reports mentioned additional rotator cuff damage and he also was treated by Dr. Saby Szajowitz to recover and regain muscle movement.\\r\\nAfter the season, the Chargers offered Brees a 5-year, $50 million contract that paid $2 million in base salary the first year and the rest heavily based on performance incentives. Brees evaluated the incentive-based offer as a sign of no confidence by the Chargers and promptly demanded the salary a top 5 \\"franchise\\" quarterback would receive.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the Chargers refused to increase their offer, Brees met with other teams. The New Orleans Saints and the Miami Dolphins were interested in Brees. New Orleans made an offer that included $10 million in guaranteed money the first year and a $12 million option the second year. Miami was unsure if Brees's shoulder was completely healed and doctors suggested the team not sign him because of the injury.[55] The Dolphins ended negotiations and traded for Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper instead. Brees signed a 6-year, $60 million deal with the Saints on March 14, 2006.[56]\\r\\nBrees had a productive first year with the Saints. The team, under first-year head coach Sean Payton, rebounded from its disastrous 2005 season (when the team was unable to play in New Orleans due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina and struggled to a 3ÿ13 record) to finish with a 10ÿ6 regular season record and won the NFC South division title. Brees threw a league-leading and franchise record 4,418 passing yards, finished third in the league with 26 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions, and had a 96.2 passer rating. Brees was named starting quarterback for the NFC in the 2007 Pro Bowl. On January 5, 2007, Brees was named first runner-up behind former teammate Tomlinson for league MVP by the Associated Press. Brees and Tomlinson were co-recipients of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award.[57][58]\\r\\nOn January 13, 2007, in his first playoff game for New Orleans, Brees was 20ÿ32 in passing attempts with 1 touchdown and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Louisiana Superdome. The Saints held on to win 27ÿ24, and advanced to the franchise's first NFC Championship Game against the Chicago Bears. Though he completed 27-of-49 passes for 354 yards against the Chicago Bears, and two touchdowns, Brees committed three costly turnovers, and was penalized for an intentional grounding in the endzone, resulting in a safety, as the Saints lost 39ÿ14.[59] Brees dislocated his left elbow during the first quarter of the Pro Bowl.[60]\\r\\nThe following season, Brees passed for 4,423 yards, topped his own record and tied a then franchise record with 28 touchdowns. He also set the NFL record previously held by Rich Gannon for pass completions in a single season with 440.[61] However, the Saints missed the playoffs with a 7ÿ9 record.[62]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Saints again missed the playoffs but Brees had a strong year statistically, finishing 15 yards short of the NFL record for passing yards thrown in a single season set by Dan Marino in 1984. He finished the season with 5,069 yards and became the second quarterback in NFL history to throw for over 5,000 yards in a season.[63]\\r\\nHe passed for 300 yards ten times during the 2008 season, tying Rich Gannon's 2002 record. He was named FedEx Air Player of the Week for his performances during Weeks 8 and 12 and was named the AP 2008 Offensive Player of the Year.[64]\\r\\nIn the first game of the 2009 season against the Detroit Lions, Brees set a career-high and franchise-tying record with six touchdown passes, going 26 out of 34 for 358 yards. The next week, Brees led the Saints to a 48ÿ22 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, throwing for 311 yards and three touchdown passes. Brees also tied the record for most touchdown passes by the end of week 2 with 9. In week 6 against the 5ÿ0 New York Giants, Brees completed 23 of 30 passes for 369 yards, 4 touchdown passes and a passer rating of 156.8 in a dominant 48ÿ27 victory.\\r\\nIn week 7, Brees led a dramatic comeback victory on the road against the Miami Dolphins, 46ÿ34. The Saints quickly faced a 24ÿ3 deficit in the second quarter, trailing for the first time all season at that point, and failing to score on their first possession as they had in all of their previous contests. Brees had a poor outing, but provided two crucial rushing touchdowns, one just before halftime to narrow the deficit to 24ÿ10, and one in the third quarter to give the Saints their first lead of the game, 37ÿ34.\\r\\nThe next week, Brees threw for 308 yards on 25 of 33 passing along with two touchdowns and one interception in leading the Saints to a 35ÿ27 victory and franchise tying best start at 7ÿ0 against the rival Atlanta Falcons. In week 9, Brees helped guide the team to a 30ÿ20 victory over the Carolina Panthers. This would be Drew's first victory over the Carolina Panthers in the Superdome and gave the Saints their best ever start in franchise history at 8ÿ0. In week 12, Brees led the Saints to an 11ÿ0 record, defeating the New England Patriots 38ÿ17 on Monday Night Football. Drew Brees totaled 371 yards passing, posting a perfect passer rating of 158.3, and is the only player to throw for five touchdowns against a team coached by Bill Belichick. After close victories over the Washington Redskins and Falcons in successive weeks to start 13ÿ0, Brees and the Saints lost their first game of the season to the Dallas Cowboys, 24ÿ17, after DeMarcus Ware caused a Brees fumble in the final seconds, ending a fourth quarter rally. The Saints then lost their last two games, with Brees sitting out the week 17 finale against the Carolina Panthers. Their 13ÿ3 record secured the #1 seed in the NFC.\\r\\nBrees's individual statistics led to numerous accolades,[65] including a Pro Bowl selection, the Maxwell Football Club's Bert Bell Award, and runner-up in voting for the AP MVP, Offensive Player of the Year, and All-Pro awards. He finished the season with a completion percentage of 70.62, establishing a new NFL record.[66][67]\\r\\nIn the divisional round of the playoffs, the Saints routed the Arizona Cardinals 45ÿ14 to advance to the NFC Championship, where they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 31ÿ28 in overtime. Brees completed 17 of 31 passes for 197 yards and 3 touchdowns.[68] The Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31ÿ17 in Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010. Brees tied a Super Bowl record with 32 pass completions and won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award. He threw for 288 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was the first league championship in Saints franchise history.[69] Brees was named the 2010 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, both for his winning the Super Bowl and his charitable work towards the reconstruction of New Orleans.[4] On December 17, 2010, he was named AP Male Athlete of the Year. Within four short years after joining the Saints, Brees was more accurate in his throws than any of the Saints' past quarterbacks.[68] Brees and his teammates were welcomed back to New Orleans with a blues band along with thousands of celebrating fans.[68]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Saints qualified for the playoffs as a wild card team with an 11ÿ5 record, but were eliminated in the Wild Card round by the Seattle Seahawks, 41ÿ36. Brees was selected to his fifth Pro Bowl-fourth with the Saintsand was voted the ninth best player in the NFL by his peers in the NFL Network's 2011 ranking. Brees had a less successful season statically, throwing a career-high 22 interceptions, tying the franchise record held by Aaron Brooks, although he managed to throw 33 touchdowns.[70]\\r\\nThe 2011 season was a record-breaking season for Brees as he led the NFL in completion percentage, passing yards and passing touchdowns, which is known as the \\"Triple Crown\\".[71] He broke Dan Marino's 27-year-old record for most passing yards in one season (5,084) in the 15th game of the season (week 16) against the Atlanta Falcons at home in New Orleans at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome with a touchdown pass to Darren Sproles. Brees also set a new Saints franchise record for passing touchdowns in a season with 46.[72]\\r\\nIn Week 2, Brees defeated the Chicago Bears during the Saints' home-opener for the first time in his career as a starting quarterback. With his first win over the Bears, Brees has defeated all NFL teams except the Baltimore Ravens. In a home game on December 4 against the Detroit Lions, Brees passed for 342 yards. Brees' performance gave him 4,031 yards on the season, making him the first quarterback in NFL history to eclipse the 4,000-yard mark in the first 12 games of a season, and the first quarterback to reach 4 consecutive seasons with 4,000+ yards and 30+ TD passes. In week 15 against the Minnesota Vikings, Brees threw for 412 yards with 5 passing touchdowns. With that game, Brees became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for 5 touchdowns, 400+ yards, while also maintaining a completion percentage of 80%, in a game.[73]\\r\\nIn Week 16 against the Atlanta Falcons at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Brees broke Dan Marino's long standing record of passing yards in a single season of 5,084 with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Darren Sproles with just under 3 minutes left in the fourth quarter of the game. He needed 305 yards to break the record entering the game and exceeded that mark with 307. He ended the game having thrown for 5,087 total passing yards for the regular season with one regular season game remaining. With his second-quarter, 8-yard touchdown pass to Marques Colston, Brees extended his streak of consecutive games with a touchdown pass to 42 games. Marino congratulated Brees via Twitter after the game, saying \\"Congrats to @drewbrees. Great job by such a special player.\\" Brees responded by tweeting, \\"Thanks to @DanMarino for his class and support during this run. It is an honor to attempt to follow the example he set for us all.\\"[74][75]\\r\\nIn week 17 against the Carolina Panthers, Brees closed out the season by setting 6 NFL records, finishing the year with 468 completions for 5,476 yards, edging Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, who also surpassed Marino's record with 5,235 yards. Brees averaged 342.25 yards passing per game, which broke Dan Fouts' record of 320.3 in a strike-shortened 1982 season.[76][77] In 2013, Peyton Manning bested Brees' record by 1 yard, and finished the season with an NFL-record 5,477 passing yards, averaging 342.31 yards per game. After defeating the Detroit Lions 45ÿ28 in the NFC Wild Card game, Brees and the Saints lost the NFC Divisional Round Playoff game to the San Francisco 49ers.\\r\\nOn July 13, the Saints and Brees agreed to a 5-year, $100 million contract. The contract had the largest amount of guaranteed money in NFL history, at $60 million. $40 million of the contract was paid the first year.[78]\\r\\nIn Week 5, Brees threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Devery Henderson against his former team, the San Diego Chargers. This was his 48th consecutive game with a touchdown pass. With that touchdown pass, Brees broke Johnny Unitas's consecutive game streak with at least one touchdown pass, and Unitas' son Joe was present at the Superdome to witness his father's 52-year-old record being broken.[79] Sean Payton, Joe Vitt and Mickey Loomis, who were all serving suspensions due to the \\"Bountygate\\" scandal, were granted permission to watch the week 5 game against the San Diego Chargers due to Brees potentially breaking Unitas' record.[80] Without their head coach, the Saints had lost their first four games but ended the losing streak with a 31ÿ24 win over the Chargers.\\r\\nIn the Week 13 game against the Atlanta Falcons, Brees threw no touchdowns and a career-high 5 interceptions, ending his consecutive game streak with at least 1 touchdown pass at 54.[81] In Week 14, Brees threw for 354 yards, giving him his 7th straight 4,000-yard passing season, surpassing Peyton Manning's record of 6 straight seasons. It was also his 5th straight season with at least 30 touchdown passes and 4,000 yards passing, also an NFL record. Brees managed to finish the 2012 season with 5,177 passing yards and 43 touchdowns despite having the worst defensive support in the NFL, whose over 7,000 yards conceded was an all-time NFL record, and the team finished the season with a 7ÿ9 record and missed the playoffs.\\r\\nBrees was selected to the 2013 Pro Bowl as an injury replacement for Robert Griffin III.[82]\\r\\nIn Week 12, Brees passed Warren Moon for 5th place on the career passing yards list with 49,566. During Week 14, Brees became the fastest player ever to join the 50,000-yard club and only the fifth player to do so.[83] He did it in 183 games, passing the 50,000 milestone in the fourth quarter of a 31ÿ13 Saints win over the Carolina Panthers on December 8, in which he threw four touchdowns. Brees also extended his NFL record to a 6th straight season of at least 30 touchdown passes with 4,000 passing yards, his 3rd straight 5,000-yard season, and his 8th straight 4,000-yard season.[84] The Saints finished with an 11ÿ5 record and narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild card round, but lost to the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, who went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII.[85]\\r\\nBrees admits that the 2014 season was his \\"most frustrating\\".[86] Brees's 2014 season began with a pair of games lost on game-ending field goals by the other team; in Week 1, the Saints lost 37-34 to division rival Atlanta in overtime and in Week 2, in a 26ÿ24 loss against the Cleveland Browns, he moved into fourth place on the career passing yardage list, ahead of John Elway.[87]\\r\\nOn October 19, 2014, Brees became the NFL's all-time leader in completion percentage at 66.21%, surpassing Chad Pennington.[88] In a Week 15 game against the Chicago Bears, he extended his streak to an NFL-record 7th straight season with at least 30 touchdown passes and 9 straight seasons of 4,000 passing yards. However his streak of 5,000 passing yard seasons ended at 3, as he passed for 4,952 yards. Brees still led the league in passing yards although he was tied with Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.[89]\\r\\nOn October 4, 2015, in the fourth week of the season, his 80-yard touchdown pass to C. J. Spiller on the second play of overtime gave the Saints a 26ÿ20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, and the team's first win of the season. The touchdown gave Brees 400 for his career, making him the 5th player in NFL history to reach the 400 touchdown milestone. Also, he became the fastest player ever to reach 400 touchdowns, doing so in 205 games. Brees also completed his 5,000th pass with a touchdown to tight end Josh Hill.[90][91] It was the quickest regular season overtime win in the history of the NFL at 13 seconds.[92]\\r\\nOn November 1, 2015, Brees tied the NFL record of touchdown passes in a game with seven during a 52ÿ49 Saints win over the New York Giants.[93] In that game, he completed 39-of-50 passes for 505 yards.[94]\\r\\nIn Week 12, his streak of 45 consecutive games with a touchdown pass ended in a 24ÿ6 loss at Houston. Two weeks later he surpassed Dan Marino for 4th in career touchdown passes as the Saints beat Tampa Bay 24ÿ17. In Week 15, he became the 4th quarterback to reach the 60,000-yard milestonein 215 games, the fastest everand had his 10th straight 4,000-yard season, plus his 94th 300-yard game, but the Detroit Lions won 35ÿ27. This put him first in most 300 yard games as Brees and Manning had been tied at 93 games prior to that game.[95] A week later his streak was extended to an eighth straight season with at least 30 touchdown passes, plus his 95th 300-yarder, all NFL records, against Jacksonville.[96] With a Week 17 win over Atlanta, Brees finished the season with four straight 300-yard games, for a career record total of 96, and a season total 4,870 yards passing, leading the league in passing yards for a record sixth time despite missing one game due to an injury.[97] He was ranked 30th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[98]\\r\\nIn the first game of the season, Brees threw a career-high 98-yard touchdown pass to Brandin Cooks in a narrow 35-34 loss the Oakland Raiders.[99] He finished the game 28ÿofÿ42 for 423 yards and four touchdown passes.[99] His 400-yard performance tied him with Peyton Manning for most 400-yard games.[99][100] The next week, he passed Dan Marino for third place in career passing yards in a loss to the New York Giants.[101]\\r\\nOn October 16, in Week 6 of the regular season, Brees threw for 465 yards and four touchdown passes with one interception in a 41ÿ38 home win over the Carolina Panthers. With this performance, Brees set an NFL record with the 15th 400-yard passing performance of his career. Entering the game, Brees had been tied with Peyton Manning with 14 career 400-yard passing games. Brees reached another milestone in the game, becoming the sixth player to record 50,000 passing yards with one team. The other five players are Peyton Manning (Colts), Brett Favre (Packers), Dan Marino (Dolphins), Tom Brady (Patriots) and John Elway (Broncos).[100]\\r\\nIn Week 7, Drew Brees became the first player in NFL history with 100 games of 300+ passing yards, in a loss against the Chiefs on October 23.[102][103]\\r\\nDuring Week 16, Brees and Aaron Rodgers tied the NFL record for most seasons with at least 35 touchdown passes with foura record shared with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.[104][105]\\r\\nBrees finished the 2016 season leading the league in passing yards with 5,208, the second most of his career and the fifth 5,000-yard season of his careermore than all other 5,000-yard seasons combined (4).[106] He also threw for 471 completions, breaking his NFL record of 468 set in 2011, and a career-high 673 attempts. Brees finished third in touchdown passes with 37, the fourth most of his career. He also finished second in completion percentage (70.0%),[107] making it the third time he has completed at least 70% of his passes in a season.[a] Despite his performance, for the third straight season, the Saints finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs.\\r\\nAfter starting off his 2017 season with a loss to Minnesota, Brees looked to bounce back in Week 2 against the New England Patriots. In the game, he was 27-of-45 for 356 yards and two touchdowns in the 36ÿ20 loss.[108]\\r\\nSource[109]\\r\\nBrees holds numerous NFL records including: the most consecutive 4,000 yard passing seasons (11),[120] most 300+ yard passing games in a season (13),[121] most consecutive games with 300+ yards passing (9, accomplished twice),[122] most completions in a season (471) and the record for most consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass (54),[123] surpassing Johnny Unitas' record of 47 straight games with a touchdown pass, a record that stood for 52 years.[123]\\r\\nSince joining the Saints, he has led all NFL quarterbacks in: total passing yards seven times (five of those over 5,000 yards).[109] Brees is 3rd in career passing yards, pass completions and attempts, and career touchdown passes in NFL history, behind Brett Favre and Peyton Manning in each.[124][125]\\r\\nBrees married his college sweetheart Brittany Dudchenko in February 2003.[144] They have three sons: Baylen, Bowen, and Callen, and a daughter, Rylen.[145][146][147][148][149][150]\\r\\nBrees moved to New Orleans not long after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.[151] Brees admits that it was tough moving to a city that was still in shambles from the hurricane; however, he and Brittany immediately fell in love with the culture and \\"soul\\" of the city.[151] They purchased and renovated a home in Uptown New Orleans, where they still live.[152] Brees admits in an interview that he thinks his family is now completed especially because three boys and one girl were always the couple's dream.[148] All four children were born in New Orleans and are being raised there.[148] The four priorities in Brees's life are faith, family, football, and philanthropy; otherwise known as the \\"four F's\\" by Brees.[7] Brees maintains his offseason home in San Diego.[153]\\r\\nBrees was raised a Christian but stated that he only became committed at age 17 when he was at church with a torn ACL and was wondering who he was and what was his purpose in life.[8] Brees was later faced other defeats such as being unwanted by the entire NFL in the 2001 Draft and later tearing his shoulder in 2005; however, Brees admits that these setbacks only strengthened his relationship with God.[7] Brees spoke about his faith saying, \\"I live for God, for the faith that I have in Him. Knowing the sacrifices that Jesus Christ made on the cross for me and feeling like it's in God's hands, all I have to do is just give my best, commit the rest to Him. Everything else is taken care of. That takes the weight off anybody's shoulders. It's to give you confidence to know that you've got somebody looking out for you.\\"[154]\\r\\nOn July 6, 2010, Brees released his first book,[11] entitled Coming Back Stronger: Unleashing the Hidden Power of Adversity, co-authored by Chris Fabry and published by Tyndale House.[155] Coming Back Stronger opened at number 3 on the nonfiction bestseller list of The New York Times.[156][157]\\r\\nBrees' mother, Mina Brees, died on August 7, 2009, aged 59 from a prescription drug overdose.[7] The death was ruled a suicide.[158] Brees was briefly excused from training camp for a \\"family matter\\".[159]\\r\\nIn 2006, Brees described their relationship as \\"nonexistent\\" ever since he refused to hire her as his agent when he entered the NFL.[160][161] After her death, Brees stated that this quote was three years old and that his relationship with his mother had been improving.[162] In his autobiography, released almost a year later, he wrote that their relationship was on the mend[163] and that she had been looking forward to her meeting his son; her first grandchild.\\r\\nIn April 2010, Brees was voted by fans as the cover athlete of EA Sports Madden NFL 11 video game.[164]\\r\\nBrees wears #9 on his uniform in honor of baseball player Ted Williams.[165]\\r\\nBrees is sometimes known by the nicknames \\"Breesus\\" by Saints fans[166][167][168] and \\"Cool Brees\\", which he acquired during his younger years for his calmness under pressure.[17][169]\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2014 Brees served on the Executive Committee of the National Football League Players Association.[170][171]\\r\\nOn March 30, 2010, Brees became the national spokesperson for AdvoCare International,[172] a multi-level marketing company,[173] which produces weight management, nutritional supplements, and personal care products.\\r\\nBrees owns a variety of restaurant businesses. In May 2015, he purchased a 25% stake in \\"Walk-On's Bistreaux & Bar\\", a sports bar that originated in New Orleans and is currently expanding their franchising into other Gulf Coast states. During initial talks with Walk-On's, Brees said that he was interested in bringing over some of the lessons that he had learned as a Jimmy John's franchise owner. He currently owns 8 Jimmy John's stores with a ninth under construction as of September 2016.[174] Carl Buergler, Jimmy John's director of operations, played football at Purdue with Brees.[175]\\r\\nIn 2010, Sports Illustrated described Brees as \\"an athlete as adored and appreciated as any in an American city today\\".[176] When Sports Illustrated selected him for the 2010 Sportsman of the Year award, it said the award was \\"[f]or not only leading the New Orleans Saints to the first Super Bowl title in the franchise's history, but also for helping lead the city of New Orleans' rebirth after the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina\\". The fact that he and his family lived in New Orleans proper instead of the suburbs like many players did further endeared him to fans.[4][152]\\r\\nIn 2003, Brees and his wife, Brittany, founded the Brees Dream Foundation to support cancer patients and research in memory of Brittany's aunt who died of cancer. Since Brees' move to New Orleans, the foundation has expanded to provide assistance for Hurricane Katrina rebuilding projects. The foundation continues to fund and support various programs in San Diego, California, where Brees usually spends his offseasons, and West Lafayette, Indiana, where the couple's alma mater, Purdue, is located and where Brees returns to visit yearly.[177]\\r\\nBrees and his foundation have been heavily involved in Hurricane Katrina recovery.[178] Drew and Brittany's Brees Dream Foundation announced a partnership[179][180] in 2007 with international children's charity Operation Kids, to rebuild and restore and recreate academic and athletic facilities, parks, and playgrounds, after-school programs, mentoring programs for the intellectually disabled, neighborhood revitalization projects and child care facilities in New Orleans. Brees also sponsors the Rebuilding thru Brotherhood program to invite fellow Sigma Chi members to the New Orleans community to build homes with the Habitat for Humanity.[citation needed]\\r\\nBrees has been on multiple USO tours throughout his career. In late June 2009 he visited the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Following his return, Brees was quoted as stating that Guantanamo captives were being treated ten times better than convicts in U.S. prisons.[181][182][183][184]\\r\\nIn February 2008, Brees signed a promotional deal with Chili's Grill & Bar to promote the chain's new line of hamburgers. The promotion helped raise money for charity. In June 2008, Brees participated in the Pro Sports Team Challenge, a competition for professional athletes to help raise money for charities. The charity Brees played for was Operation Kids.[185]\\r\\nOn February 18, 2007, Brees was honored by the Krewe of Bacchus, a New Orleans Mardi Gras parade organization, as the 2007 Grand Marshal of the Bacchus parade.[186] Brees presided as Bacchus XLII for the 2010 parade on February 14, 2010, one week after the Super Bowl during Mardi Gras season.[187]\\r\\nIn June 2010, President Obama appointed Brees to be co-chair of the newly renamed President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, along with former Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes.[188][189]\\r\\nIn October 2010, Brees appeared in an It Gets Better video, where he gave an anti-bullying message in the wake of a series of suicides committed by gay teenagers.[190]\\r\\nNames in bold are still active","input":"When did drew brees win the super bowl?"},{"output":"271 became casualties","context":"The Battle of Balaclava, fought on 25 October 1854 during the Crimean War, was part of Siege of Sevastopol (1854ÿ1855) to capture the port and fortress of Sevastopol, Russia's principal naval base on the Black Sea. The engagement followed the earlier Allied victory in September at the Battle of the Alma, where the Russian General Menshikov had positioned his army in an attempt to stop the Allies progressing south towards their strategic goal.[3] Alma was the first major encounter fought in the Crimea since the Allied landings at Kalamita Bay on 14 September, and was a clear battlefield success; but a tardy pursuit by the Allies failed to gain a decisive victory, allowing the Russians to regroup, recover and prepare their defence.\\r\\nThe Russians split their forces. Defending within the allied siege lines was primarily the Navy manning the considerable static defenses of the city and threatening the allies from without was the mobile Army under General Menshiikov.\\r\\nThe Allies decided against an immediate assault on Sevastopol and instead prepared for a protracted siege. The British, under the command of Lord Raglan, and the French, under Canrobert, positioned their troops to the south of the port on the Chersonese Peninsula: the French Army occupied Kamiesh on the west coast whilst the British moved to the southern port of Balaclava. However, this position committed the British to the defence of the right flank of the Allied siege operations, for which Raglan had insufficient troops. Taking advantage of this exposure, the Russian General Liprandi, with some 25,000 men, prepared to attack the defences in and around Balaclava, hoping to disrupt the supply chain between the British base and their siege lines.\\r\\nThe battle began with a Russian artillery and infantry attack on the Ottoman redoubts that formed Balaclava's first line of defence. The Ottoman forces initially resisted the Russian assaults, but lacking support they were eventually forced to retreat. When the redoubts fell, the Russian cavalry moved to engage the second defensive line held by the Ottoman and the British 93rd Highland Regiment in what came to be known as the 'Thin Red Line'. This line held and repulsed the attack; as did General James Scarlett's British Heavy Brigade who charged and defeated the greater proportion of the cavalry advance, forcing the Russians onto the defensive. However, a final Allied cavalry charge, stemming from a misinterpreted order from Raglan, led to one of the most famous and ill-fated events in British military history ÿ the Charge of the Light Brigade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British and French fleets departed from the Bulgarian port of Varna on 5 September 1854, heading towards Kalamita Bay in the Crimea. By the 14th, the troops began to land; within four days the Allied force of 61,400 infantry, 1,200 cavalry and 137 guns, was ashore.[4] Thirty-three miles (~53?km) to the south of the landing zone, beyond the Bulganak, Alma, Katcha and Belbek rivers, lay the Russian naval base and fortress of Sevastopol, the key Allied objective in the Crimea. General Menshikov, aware of the Allied presence, prepared his troops on the banks of the River Alma in an effort to halt the Franco-British advance, but on 20 September he was soundly defeated in what was the first major battle in the Crimea. News of Menshikov's defeat was met with disbelief by Tsar Nicholas I in St. Petersburg ÿ it seemed it would only be a matter of time before Sevastopol fell.[5] But Allied hesitation, first from the French commander-in-chief, Saint-Arnaud, then by Lord Raglan, allowed the dispirited Russians to escape the battlefield in relative order,[6] allowing Menshikov and his army to reach Sevastopol, reorganise and rebuild their morale.[7] \\"It is frightful to think what might have happened,\\" wrote Vice-Admiral Kornilov, \\"had it not been for this cardinal error of the enemy's.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe Allied march south finally recommenced on the morning of 23 September 1854, but there was as yet no definite plan of action;[9] it was not until they had passed the River Katcha in sight of Sevastopol itself, that the Allied commanders discussed their options.[10] The original plan had envisaged a move across the River Belbek before attacking the north side (the Severnaya) of Sevastopol harbour, defended by the Star Fort; but recent naval intelligence had revealed that the position was much stronger than had first been realised. John Burgoyne, the British Army's most experienced engineer, advocated an attack on Sevastopol from the south which, from all reports, was still an imperfectly entrenched position.[11] This was a view shared by Saint-Arnaud who, having received his own intelligence of Russian reinforcements, had refused to agree to an attack from the north. Burgoyne's proposed 'flank march' required the Allies to go round the city to the east in order to attack the harbour from the south where the defences were weakest.[12] Raglan was inclined to agree, arguing that he had always been disposed to such an operation; he knew, too, that the problem of re-supply would be eased with the seizing of the southern ports on the Chersonese Peninsula.[13]\\r\\nOn 24 September, Menshikov began to move his army out of Sevastopol towards Bakchi Serai and Simferopol, leaving Admirals Kornilov and Nakhimov to organise the 18,000-strong garrison (mainly sailors and marines) and prepare the port's defences.[14] By venturing into the interior of the Crimea, Menshikov would not only keep open his communications with Russia, but would also be in touch with reinforcements from Odessa or Kertch; moreover, he would be free to operate in the field and threaten the Allied flank.[15] Whilst Menshikov moved east, the Anglo-French-Turkish army, with the British in the vanguard, continued its march towards the southern coast of the peninsula. The heat was oppressive, the water sparse, and cholera rife, taking a heavy toll on the men including Saint-Arnaud who was already ill with cancer. The march had been a real trial and was not without incident. At one point, on 25 September near MacKenzie's Farm, Raglan and his staff in front of the British column stumbled across the rear of the retreating Russians; with the rest of his army strung out behind in hopeless disorder, Menshikov missed a chance to inflict a major reverse on the British.[16] By the 26th, however, Raglan had reached the village of Kadikoi, and was able to look down on the narrow inlet of Balaclava. That same day Saint-Arnaud, now critically ill, surrendered his command to General Canrobert.[17]\\r\\nThe harbour at Balaclava was too small for both Allied armies to use. By rights the French, who had claimed the honour of holding the right of the line, should have occupied Balaclava whilst the British should have moved west to the ports of Kazatch and Kamiesh. Canrobert offered the British the choice, but badly advised by Admiral Lyons, Raglan chose Balaclava for his base, not realising that the two western bays offered far better facilities as supply ports.[18] Moreover, Raglan committed the British Army to the defence of the right flank of the Allied operation, and would have to ensure the security of both Anglo-French armies against the threat posed by Menshikov's forces to the east. The decision by Raglan was a bad mistake, and one for which the British Army was to pay a terrible price.[19]\\r\\nFor many, the only justification for the 'flank march' was an immediate assault upon Sevastopol. George Cathcart, commander of the British 4th Division, pleaded with Raglan for instant action.[20] \\"I am sure I could walk into it, with scarcely the loss of a man,\\" wrote Cathcart to Raglan on 28 September from the heights above the eastern approach to the city. \\"We could leave our packs, and run into it even in open day  We see people walking about the streets in great consternation ...\\"[21] But caution prevailed, and plans by Burgoyne for a formal siege, backed by Canrobert, were prepared. When Raglan told Cathcart that nothing would happen until the Allied siege trains had been landed, Cathcart could not hide his irritation, \\"Land the siege trains! But my dear Lord Raglan, what the devil is there to knock down?\\"[22]\\r\\nHaving decided upon which port they would occupy the Allies set about deploying their forces on the Chersonese Peninsula. The peninsula is bounded to the north by Sevastopol Harbour, at the head of which the River Chernaya flows from the south-east. The eastern boundary is formed by a long escarpment, the Sapoun Heights, averaging 600 feet high, and pierced by two passes only: the metalled Woronstov road, and, at the southern end of the heights, the Col, through which ran a steeper and more difficult road leading from the west end of Sevastopol to Balaclava.[23] Sevastopol itself was divided in two by the Dockyard Creek. Two of Canrobert's four divisions, supervised by General Forey, were allotted the western siege operations around the city, from the Black Sea to the Dockyard Creek; the other two divisions, under General Bosquet, would act as a covering force along the Sapoun Heights.[24] To Bosquet's north lay the camp of the British 1st Division, and beyond this De Lacy Evans' 2nd Division guarding the extreme right of the Allied line with the Inkerman Heights to its front and the Chernaya Valley to its right.[25]\\r\\nThe port of Balaclava lay outside the main Allied perimeter and had to be provided with a defensive system of its own.[26] The Woronstov Road ran down from the Sapoun Heights along a ridge, running eastÿwest, known as the Causeway Heights, dividing the plain into two sections ÿ the North Valley and the South Valley. Redoubts upon the Causeway Heights offered Balaclava its first line of defence: five were built upon the heights ÿ approximately 500 yards (~450 m) apart ÿ and one upon what came to be known as Canrobert's Hill, slightly to the south and covering the extreme right of the British defences (see map below). The redoubts housed a total of nine naval guns, all 12-pounders from HMS Diamond: three in No.1 redoubt on Canrobert's Hill; two each in redoubts 2, 3 and 4. Redoubts 5 and 6 (the two at the western end of the Causeway Heights), were still unfinished and without any guns.[27] These defences were hastily constructed, but they were not small works: No.1 redoubt held a garrison of 600 Turks, whilst redoubts 2,3, and 4 each held 300; all were accompanied by one British artillery NCO. The inner line of defence of the British base was supplied by the 93rd Highlanders and a Royal Artillery field battery stationed at the village of Kadikoi to the north of Balaclava.[28] These were supported by Royal Marines and artillery positioned along the heights above the port, as well as additional Ottoman troops. In addition to these defences Raglan could call upon the 1,500 men of Lord Lucan's Cavalry Division camped on the western end of the South Valley, along with a troop of Royal Horse Artillery. The total force available for the immediate defence of the British base at Balaclava numbered around 4,500 men, supported by 26 guns.[27]\\r\\nAs the Allied siege guns bombarded Sevastopol the Russian reserves were moving to the Crimea. The Russians sought to relieve Sevastopol from bombardment by marching newly arrived reinforcements from the Danubian front.[29] This force of Russian reinforcements would strike at the allies' main port of supplyBalaclava.[29] At the forefront of these reinforcements was the 12th Infantry Division ÿ part of the Russian 4th Corps ÿ under General Pavel Liprandi.[29] This division, consisting of the Azovsky, Dnieper, Ukraine and Odessa regiments, along with four batteries of artillery, had arrived from Bessarabia; by the time the division had reached the Crimea, Menshikov had decided on the plan to use them to attack the Allied rear from Chorgun, and march on Balaclava.[30]\\r\\nThe vulnerability of Balaclava was well known to both sides. Undertaking the siege operations around Sevastopol whilst securing the Allies' eastern flank was stretching the resources of Raglan's dwindling forces ÿ British casualties at the Alma had been high, and many were still suffering from the cholera epidemic; others simply fell sick from exhaustion. With the arrival of further Russian reinforcements, Menshikov's total force in theatre (including 12 Division) numbered around 65,000.[31] The remainder of 4th Corps ÿ 10 and 11 Divisions ÿ were also heading towards the Crimea, but Menshikov, under pressure from Nicholas I to strike back at the Allies, decided not to wait for these troops before beginning the attack.\\r\\nThe first move by the Russians came on the early morning of 18 October 1854, when Lieutenant Colonel Rakovitch moved against the village of Chorgun with three infantry battalions, 200 Cossacks and four guns. From here, Liprandi, Rakovitch and Major General Semyakin were able to reconnoitre the Allied redoubts along the Causeway Heights. To the Russian commanders, and, belatedly, to the Royal Engineers, the redoubts were recognised to be too far forward of the inner defensive line of Balaclava to be adequately defended and supported by the British. Russian reconnaissance reports had also indicated that these outer defences were occupied by a mixture of Tunisians, raw recruits and militia, and not of the same calibre of men that had defeated them on the Danube at the beginning of the war. To Liprandi and his generals it seemed a swift strike against the redoubts was certain of success.[32]\\r\\nBy 23 October Liprandi had gathered 16,000 men, known as the 'Detachment of Chorgun', comprising 17 battalions, 30 squadrons and 64 guns. The left column, commanded by Major General Gribbe, was to advance across the Chernaya River and towards the village of Kamara. The centre column, under Major General Semyakin, was divided into two wings: Semyakin himself, commanding the left wing, was to lead his troops south from Chorgun before moving against Canrobert's Hill and No.1 redoubt; Major General Levutsky, commanding the right wing of the centre column, was tasked to assault No.2 redoubt farther to the west. Meanwhile, the right column, under Colonel Skyuderi, was to advance across the Chernaya via the Tractir Bridge before moving south through the Fedyukhin Heights and across the North Valley to attack No.3 redoubt. The attacks were to be supported by Lieutenant General Ryzhov's cavalry. A further force, numbering 4,500 men and 14 guns under Major General Zhabokritsky, protected Liprandi's right from Allied interference. Once the redoubts had been captured, Zhabokritsky was to occupy the Fedioukine Heights. In total (including Zhabokritsky's force and a reserve held back at the Tractir Bridge) Liprandi had at his disposal around 25,000 men and 78 guns ÿ not enough to threaten the siege lines, but more than enough to compromise the defences at Balaclava whose loss to the Allies would be tremendous.[33] (See map below).\\r\\nRecent intelligence received by the British had indicated a major Russian attack was imminent. After a considerable number of false alarms the previous week, however, Raglan failed to act, believing that they were needlessly exhausting his men who were turned out on every report.[34] But this latest intelligence proved accurate, and early on 25 October, just before 05:00, Liprandis troops of the 'Chorgun Detachment' left their camp and marched off in silence towards the Balaclava valleys.[35]\\r\\nThe village of Kamara was the most easterly picket for Allied soldiers, providing a useful observation point for Lucan's vedettes. In the dark dawn, a squadron of Russian Cossacks, followed by a host of uhlans, rode slowly towards the village. These troops were the leading elements of Gribbe's force. First to discover that the Russians had moved up under cover of dark was the duty field officer of the day, Captain Alexander Low of the 4th Light Dragoons. The picket in Kamara had not seen the advancing Cossacks (there is some suggestion that they were sleeping), and it was only through Low's timely arrival and his shouts that they managed to escape and make their way to the nearest redoubt on the Causeway Heights.[36] Behind the Cossacks and uhlans came the Dnieper Regiment along with the artillery. Immediately, Gribbe positioned his ten guns on the slopes to the west of Kamara, leaving his gunners with a clear view of No.1 redoubt on Canrobert's Hill.[37]\\r\\nIn accordance with his usual practice Lucan had gone forward at daybreak to inspect the redoubts and outposts, accompanied by his staff: Lord George Paget, Lord William Paulet, and Major Thomas McMahon. As they approached Canrobert's Hill, two signal flags were observed, signifying the approach of the Russians. Paget, commanding officer of the 4th Light Dragoons (and commanding officer of the Light Brigade in Cardigan's absence), later recalled the moment when they realized something was wrong:\\r\\n\\"Hello,\\" said Lord William, \\"there are two flags flying; what does it mean?\\" \\"Why, that surely is the signal that the enemy is approaching,\\" said Major McMahon. \\"Are you quite sure?\\" we replied. Hardly were the words out of McMahon's mouth, when bang went a cannon from the redoubt in question, fired on the advancing masses of the enemy.[37]\\r\\nThe Ottoman guns from No.1 redoubt on Canrobert's hill fired on the Russians at around 06:00 ÿ the Battle of Balaclava had begun.[37] Lucan despatched Captain Charteris to inform Raglan that the redoubts were under attack. Charteris arrived at around 07:00, but those at the British headquarters had already heard the sound of the guns.[37] Lucan himself rode quickly back towards Kadikoi to confer with Sir Colin Campbell, commander of the Balaclava defences. The two men agreed that this was not another Russian feint, but an attack in force with the intention of taking the British base. Campbell prepared his 93rd Highlanders to meet the enemy, whilst Lucan returned to the cavalry.[38] Leaving the Light Brigade where it stood, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade towards the redoubts, hoping his presence might discourage any further Russian advance on Balaclava. Realizing his show of strength had little impact, however, Lucan led the Heavies back to their original position alongside the Light Brigade. The Ottoman forces were left to face the full force of the Russian assault almost alone.[38]\\r\\nWhile Gribbe's artillery continued to shell No.1 redoubt, the Russian columns under Levutsky, Semyakin, and Skyuderi began to move into the North Valley. Although the Heavy Brigade had pulled back, the British did send forward their available artillery to assist the Ottoman forces on the Causeway Heights. Captain George Maude's troop of horse artillery, I Troop, unlimbered its four 6-pounder and two 12-pounder guns between redoubts 2 and 3,[39] whilst Captain Barker's battery, W Battery, of the Royal Artillery, moved out of Balaclava and took its position on Maude's left. However, the artillery duel was a very one sided affair. The heavier Russian guns (some 18-pounders), particularly No.4 battery under Lieutenant Postikov, together with the riflemen of the Ukraine regiment, took their toll on both men and ordnance.[40] Running short of ammunition and taking hits, Maude's troop was forced to retire (Maude himself was severely wounded). Their place taken by two guns from Barker's battery. As the British artillery fire slackened, Semyakin prepared to storm No. 1 redoubt, personally leading the assault together with three battalions of the Azovsky Regiment under Colonel Krudener. \\"I waved my hat on both sides,\\" recalled Semyakin. \\"Everybody rushed after me and I was protected by the stern Azovs.\\"[40] The Ottoman forces on Canrobert's Hill resisted stubbornly.[41] Although the attack had begun at 06:00, it was not until 07:30 when No.1 redoubt fell.[42] During that time the 600 Ottoman defenders had suffered from the heavy artillery bombardment; in the ensuing fight in the redoubt and subsequent pursuit by the Cossacks, an estimated 170 Ottomans were killed. In his first report of the action for The Times, William Russell wrote that the Turks 'received a few shots and then bolted', but afterwards admitted that he had not been a witness to the start of the battle, confessing, 'Our treatment of the Turks was unfair  ignorant as we were that the Turkish in No.1 redoubt lost more than a fourth of their number ere they abandoned it to the enemy'.[43] Later Lucan and Campbell too acknowledged the firmness with which the assault on No 1 redoubt, which was not visible from their vantage point, had been resisted; it was not until this had been overwhelmed did the defenders abandon redoubts 2, 3 and 4.[44] Of the estimated 2,500 Russians who took part in the assault the Azovsky Regiment lost two officers and 149 men killed.[45]\\r\\nThe remaining redoubts were now in danger of falling into the hands of the oncoming Russians. The battalions of the Ukraine Regiment under Colonel Dudnitsky-Lishin, attacked redoubts Nos.2 and 3, while the Odessa Regiment under Skyuderi advanced on redoubt No.4. The Ottoman forces in these positions, having already watched their compatriots flee the first redoubt and realizing that the British were not coming to their aid, retreated towards Balaclava, pursued by the Cossacks who had little trouble dispatching any stray or isolated men. The few British NCOs could do nothing but spike the guns, rendering them unusable.[46] The Ottoman forces had gained some time for the Allies, but in the end the Turks were forced to abandon the redoubts.[28] By 08:00 the Russians had occupied redoubts 1, 2 and 3, and, considering it too close to the enemy, had razed redoubt No.4.[47]\\r\\nCanrobert had been informed of the Russian attack at about 07:30, and had immediately ridden off to join Raglan. Bosquet, having been aroused by the sound of the cannon, had ordered the 2nd Brigade of the French 1st Division (under General Vinoy) to march towards Balaclava in support of the British. Additionally, the 1st Brigade under General Espinasse began to move, along with the divisional artillery and the Chasseurs d'Afrique. The French 3rd Division was put on alert, and the horse artillery of the reserve harnessed.[48] Raglan had at first thought the Russian advance a feint, possibly designed to occupy him whilst the enemy stormed out of Sevastopol to attack his army overlooking the heights above the city; but now he saw that he had been wrong.[49] With the first four redoubts on the Causeway Heights either captured or out of action, all that protected Balaclava were Lucan's Cavalry Division, together with the 550 men of the 93 Highlanders, Barker's W Battery, 100 invalids under Colonel Daveney, and some Ottomans, reinforced by their countrymen from the redoubts who had rallied and formed up alongside them.[50] It was only now that Raglan ordered the British 1st Division under the Duke of Cambridge, and Cathcart's 4th Division, to move into the plain. The 1st Division got away promptly, but when Raglan's staff officer informed Cathcart that the Russians were marching on Balaclava, he at first refused to comply, complaining that his men had only just finished their shift in the trenches before Sevastopol. In the end he did move, but the delay brought his division down 40 minutes after the Duke's.[51] It would take a least two hours to march an infantry division down from the heights overlooking Sevastopol into the plain of Balaclava. The Russians appeared to have the intentions and the means to capture the British base in a much shorter time.[49]\\r\\nAt approximately 07:45, the commander of the Light Brigade, Lord Cardigan, reached his cavalry, having arrived from his yacht moored in Balaclava harbour. Raglan, meanwhile, had taken up his position on the Sapoun Heights, 650 feet (~200 m) above the plain. Unwilling at this point to risk his cavalry without infantry support (as he had done throughout the whole campaign), Raglan issued his first order to the Cavalry Division at 08:00 ÿ \\"Cavalry to take ground to the left of the second line of redoubts occupied by the Turks\\".[52] The order was ambiguous and misleading (there was no 'second line of redoubts' and the word 'left' is dependent on the perspective of the viewer), but on this occasion Lucan had interpreted the order correctly, and moved his cavalry to the west, placing them between No. 6 redoubt and the foot of the Sapoun Heights where they could not be seen by, or engage with, the Russians. The new position placed the Light Brigade near, but to one side, of the mouth of the North Valley; the Heavy Brigade sat on their right. However, 30 minutes after issuing his first order, Raglan now changed his mind and issued his second order at 08:30 ÿ \\"Eight squadrons of heavy Dragoons to be detached towards Balaclava to support the Turks who are wavering\\". There was no evidence that the Turks formed up alongside the Highlanders were wavering, but Raglan thought they were, or might soon do so.[53] As each regiment comprised two squadrons, Lucan, with growing frustration, was required to move four of his five Heavy Brigade regiments back onto the open plain and the defensive line of Kadikoi. Although this order meant he had to divide his cavalry ÿ thus reducing the effectiveness of each part ÿ Lucan complied, and ordered General Scarlett to lead four regiments back to where they had just come from.[54]\\r\\nLiprandi now brought forward Ryzhov's cavalry to press home his advantage. Ryzhov's force consisted of eight squadrons of the 11th Kiev Hussars, six of the 12th Ingermanland Hussars, three of the 53rd Don Cossack Regiment, and the 1st Ural Cossacks, totalling between 2,000 and 3,000 men (sources vary), and 16 guns.[55] The Russian cavalry crossed in a south-westerly direction across the Chernaya river and, at about 09:00, streamed into the North Valley. When level with the empty No.4 redoubt, Ryzhov wheeled to the left, crested the Causeway Heights, and came to a halt; before him, he could see the Heavy Brigade moving east across his front, while away to the south he could discern the Highlanders and Turks immediately to the north of Kadikoi. Ryzhov detached 400 men of the Ingermanland Hussars to turn and head straight for the Allied infantry position. Sir Colin Campbell, commander of the Highland Brigade and thus the 93rd Highlanders, brought his men forward from behind the hillock that had sheltered them from the Russian artillery. With only Balaclava and the Black Sea to their backs, he rode quickly along the line expressing his determination to resist ÿ \\"Men, remember there is no retreat from here. You must die where you stand.\\"[56] Campbell's aide, John Scott, replied \\"Aye Sir Colin. Needs be we'll do that.\\" Campbell had such a poor opinion of the Russian cavalry that he did not bother telling his men to form square; instead, he lined them up in the normal two-deep firing line.[57] Raglan on the Sapoun Heights had a grandstand view, as did William Russell, who wrote furiously in his notebook:\\r\\nThe Russians dash at the Highlanders. The ground flies beneath their horses' feet; gathering speed at every stride, they dash on towards that thin red streak topped with a line of steel.[58]\\r\\nThe British delivered their first volley at long range and failed to fell a single Russian.[59] A second volley thundered, supported by fire from guns of Barker's battery and those of the Marines. This caused the Russians to swerve to their left, which Campbell took as an attempt to turn his right. He sternly checked an inclination to charge with the bayonet, and instead threw forward the 93rd's right-hand, grenadier company, under Captain Ross.[60] This delivered a third volley which decided the issue. Barely five minutes after it had begun the Ingermanland Hussars were in retreat, and heading towards the Causeway Heights: the Russian commander of the brigade had reasoned that such a small, unsquared line of British infantry could not hope to hold out a cavalry charge, therefore there must be a larger force behind them.[61] It was not until later accounts that Russell's 'thin red streak', became the famous 'Thin Red Line'.[54]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the main part of Ryzhov's cavalry remained static on the southern slopes of the Causeway Heights, some 800 yards (~730 m) from Scarlett's Heavy Brigade still moving south-east in the South Valley.[61] The eight squadrons of the Heavy Brigade consisted of two each from the Scots Greys, the 6th Dragoons, 4th Dragoon Guards, and the 5th Dragoon Guards; the brigade's remaining two squadrons from the 1st Royal Dragoons were left in their original position to the west of No.6 redoubt. Although outnumbering the British by two or three to one and having the advantage of the high ground, the Russians seemed shaken by the unexpected presence of Scarlett's cavalry.[62]\\r\\nScarlett, notoriously short-sighted, remained unaware that the Russians were there. However, once he had negotiated a vineyard and the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, he was notified by his ADC, Lieutenant Elliot, of the proximity of the Russian cavalry on their left flank.[63] Scarlett gave the order 'Left wheel into line' which turned the two advanced regiments into line to face the enemy; these were shortly followed by the other two regiments forming a second line. Had the Russians charged at this moment they would have caught Scarlett's men completely disorganised, yet Ryzhov let the chance slip.[64] Lucan, who had also seen the Russians, rode across with his staff from the Light Brigade to join the Heavies. So impatient was he to attack that he ordered his duty trumpeter, Trumpet Major Joy, to sound the charge ÿ but nothing happened. An attempt to attack before his men were in perfect alignment was contrary to every precept that the officers had learnt back in England, and it was only when the dressing had been completed to his satisfaction did Scarlett order his trumpeter, Trumpet Major Monks, to sound the charge.[62] The Heavy Brigade began to move against the Russian cavalrymen.\\r\\nThe charge of the Heavy Brigade was anything but a charge ÿ the brigade had launched uphill from a standing start, and the short distance between the two combatants had hardly allowed their horses to reach the trot. Moreover, the Russians were at last moving to meet them. Scarlett was first into Ryzhov's cavalry, closely followed by his staff, and, initially, just three squadrons ÿ two of the Scots Greys on the left, and one of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons on the right, totalling 300 men.[65] The first to feel the force of the British attack were the Ingermanland Hussars, under the command of Major General Khaletsky. Staff-captain Arbuzov later described how they \\"  had to fight with the regiment of Queen Victoria's Dragoon Guards in their red coats  Neither we nor the English wanted to yield.\\"[66] A British Dragoon later described the action from his own perspective ÿ \\"They were so superior in numbers, they outflanked us, and we were in the middle of them  I hope God will forgive me, for I felt more like a devil than a man.\\"[65]\\r\\nShortly, the second squadron of the Inniskillings attacked the left flank of the Russians, followed by the 5th Dragoon Guards who crashed into the Russians as they folded around the rear of the Scots Greys. Beyond them the 4th Dragoons, in one unbroken line and to cries of Faugh A Ballagh, attacked the right rear of the Russian cavalry; the force of their impact was such that they were able to hack their way from one flank to the other with the loss of only one man.[67] Finally came the Royal Dragoons who, ignoring their orders to remain behind, attacked on their own initiative, striking the right front of the Russians.[68] Ryzhov had been caught flat-footed, allowing Scarlett's cavalry to push ahead, heaving and hacking at their opponents from all sides before gaining the ascendancy. \\"At length they turned and well they might,\\" wrote Lieutenant Godman. \\"We pursued about 300 yards, and then called off with much difficulty, the gunners opened on them, and gave them a fine peppering.\\"[69] These guns were from C Troop, Royal Horse Artillery under Captain Brandling, whose 24-pounders dissuaded Ryzhov's cavalry from reforming and charging again. The Russians retreated in the direction of the Causeway Heights before halting at the east end of the North Valley.\\r\\nThe Charge of the Heavy Brigade had lasted no more than 10 minutes. Ryzhov's cavalry suffered 40ÿ50 killed and over 200 wounded; the British lost 10 killed and 98 wounded.[70] Scarlett's attack had been a remarkable success, yet it could have been a greater victory. When the Heavies attacked, the Earl of Cardigan's Light Brigade was less than 500 yards (~450 m) from Ryzhov's cavalry. The spectators on the Sapoun Heights, and the officers and men in the Light Brigade watching the Russians retreat in disorder, expected Cardigan to lead a pursuit and finish them off. Captain William Morris of the 17th Lancers urged his commander on, but Cardigan claimed he could not advance given the orders he had received from Lucan to remain in his position 'and to defend it against any attack'.[71] Lucan later gave a different version from Cardigan's. He confirmed he had ordered Cardigan to defend his position, but maintained that his parting orders made it quite clear that he had permission to take advantage of so obvious an opportunity.[72] Whatever the differences the Light Brigade had done nothing but look on. When Morris rode back to his regiment after confronting Cardigan, he could not hide his frustration ÿ \\"My God, my God, what a chance we are losing.\\"[73]\\r\\nIt was approaching 09:30, and the first part of the battle was over. So far Liprandi had enjoyed mixed fortunes: although his cavalry had been repulsed by Campbell's 'Thin Red Line' and Scarlett's Heavies, his troops under Gribbe, Semyakin, Levutsky, and Skyuderi were still in possession of redoubts Nos. 1ÿ3, and had destroyed redoubt No.4. In all, the Russians had 11 infantry battalions and 32 guns on the Causeway Heights, while to the north, on the Fedioukine Heights, Zhabokritsky had positioned eight battalions, four squadrons, and 14 guns (some sources state 10 guns).[71] In front of Ryzhov's cavalry  drawn up across the eastern end of the North Valley ÿ Liprandi placed the eight guns of the 3rd Don Cossack Battery, commanded by Prince Obolensky. These guns, 6- and 9-pounders, served by 200 men, stared straight down the North Valley.[74] Liprandi now also had at his disposal six squadrons of Lancers divided into two bodies: three squadrons on the Fedioukine Heights; three others in a ravine on the side of the Causeway Heights.[75]\\r\\nRaglan was anxious to exploit Scarlett's success and drive the Russians off the Causeway Heights, but Cathcart's and Cambridge's infantry divisions had still not arrived; every minute that passed gave the Russians more time to prepare their defences for the expected British counter-attack. The British commander believed that the enemy had retreated in such disorder that a show of force by his cavalry  in advance of the infantry's arrival ÿ would be enough to persuade the Russians to abandon the Causeway Heights. At 10:00, therefore, he gave his third order of the day to the Cavalry Division: Cavalry to advance and take advantage of any opportunity to recover the Heights. They will be supported by infantry which have been ordered. Advance on two fronts.[76] Raglan wished his cavalry to advance immediately, but the ambiguity of the order had again resulted in a misunderstanding. Lucan had assumed he was first to wait for the infantry before moving forward. Accordingly, he ordered the Light Brigade into the North Valley, while the Heavy Brigade held the entrance of the South Valley, perhaps in response to the order 'Advance on two fronts'.[76] Lucan believed he had complied with the order as far as he could until the infantry arrived, but Raglan looked on with growing impatience at his immobile cavalry. It was at this moment when a staff officer (identity unknown) shouted out that the Russians in the redoubts on the Causeway Heights were dragging away the captured British guns.[77] The British infantry divisions were now only minutes away, but only the cavalry could move fast enough and prevent the loss of the guns. With growing impatience Raglan dictated to General Richard Airey the fourth and final order to Lord Lucan. This order was to be understood in conjunction with the third as an instruction to do immediately what had been previously ordered:\\r\\n10:45. Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front  follow the enemy and try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns  Troop Horse Artillery may accompany ÿ French cavalry is on your left. R Airey. Immediate.[78]\\r\\nHaving read the order scribbled down by Airey, Raglan summoned Captain Louis Nolan of the 15th The King's Hussars, Airey's hot-tempered aide-de-camp, to deliver it to Lucan. As he turned his horse to head directly down the escarpment, Raglan called after him, \\"Tell Lord Lucan the cavalry is to attack immediately.\\" These words sealed the fate of the Light Brigade.[79]\\r\\nLucan was puzzled by Raglan's imprecise order.[80] There was no mention of heights  it referred instead to the front  and gone were all references to infantry. He was to try to 'prevent the enemy carrying away the guns' but from his position he could not see any guns being carried away. When Lucan questioned the order an excited Nolan told him he was to attack immediately.\\r\\nNolans gesture was imprecise, and pointed not to the redoubts and the captured British guns but, it seemed  at least to Lucan and his staff officers present  to the Russian battery guarding Ryzhov's cavalry at the end of the valley. Seeing Lucan's confusion, Nolan could have explained what Raglan intended, perhaps making the link ÿ if he himself knew of the connection  between the third and fourth order; however, taken aback by Nolan's insolence, Lucan refused further discussion, and rode over to Cardigan standing in front of his brigade. Both cavalry commanders knew the dangers of attacking down the valley. When Cardigan learned what was expected of his brigade, he questioned the sanity of the order as conveyed to him by Lucan: \\" allow me to point out to you that there is a battery in front, battery on each flank, and the ground is covered with Russian riflemen.\\"\\r\\n\\"I know it,\\" said Lucan. \\"But Lord Raglan will have it. We have no choice but to obey.\\"[82]\\r\\nThe Light Brigade had formed up in two lines. The 13th Light Dragoons, the 17th Lancers, and the 11th Hussars, formed the first line (the latter regiment was soon moved behind the Lancers to reduce the width of the front). Paget commanded the second line formed by the 4th Light Dragoons and the 8th Hussars. Once the brigade had moved off, Lucan would follow with the Heavy Brigade in support.[83]\\r\\nAt 11:10 the Light Brigade began their advance towards the Russians guns over a mile (~ 2?km) away.[84] When the first line was clear of the second, the order was given to 'Trot'. Initially there was nothing to indicate that Cardigan was not going to conform to Raglan's intentions, and it was only after he had travelled some 200 yards (~180 m) that the enormity of the misconstrued order became apparent to the spectators on the Sapoun Heights. Instead of inclining to the right towards the redoubts on the Causeway Heights and the captured British guns, the Light Brigade continued towards Obolensky's battery at the end of the valley.[85] But it was too late to do anything. Nolan was the first to be killed when he dashed forward ahead of Cardigan, either in an effort to force the pace, or, suddenly realising the terrible mistake that was being made (and his part in it), in an attempt to change the direction of the brigade towards Raglan's intended objective.[86] Whatever the reason, Nolan was hit by a splinter from a shell fired from one of the guns positioned on the Fedioukine Heights.\\r\\nWhen the proper interval between themselves and the Lights had developed, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade forward. The Heavies were also hitLucan himself was slightly wounded, and his horse hit twice ÿ but these men would have suffered more casualties had it not been for the charge of the 150 men of the Chasseurs d'Afrique.[87] The French cavalry had formed up to the left of the British position. When they had seen the Light Brigade cut up, Major Abdelal led an attack up the Fedioukine Heights to charge the flank of the Russian battery, forcing them to drag away their guns. Yet it was now that Lucan ÿ concluding that the Light Brigade would be wiped out before they reached the Russians at the end of the valley[80]  ordered the Heavy Brigade to halt their advance and retire, leaving Cardigan's men without support. Turning to Lord Paulet, he justified his action and his desire to preserve at least half of his cavalry division, \\"They have sacrificed the Light Brigade; they shall not have the Heavy, if I can help it.\\"[88]\\r\\nAt 11:15, the eight Russian guns on the Causeway Heights opened up on the Light Brigade, whose front line was now more than halfway down the valley; for the next 400 yards (~365 m) the men also came under fire from the guns to their front. At a distance of 250 yards (~ 230 m) from Obolensky's battery, Cardigan ordered his bugler to sound the 'Gallop'. \\"And so we went through this scene of carnage,\\" reported Paget, \\"wondering each moment which would be our last  It required a deal of closing in, by this time, to fill up the vacant gaps.\\"[89] Cardigan now ordered the 'Charge'. Some amongst the gun crews now doubted they could stop the advance ÿ they could now see the lowered lances of the 17th Lancers. Having fired their last shot of canister some of the Russian artillerymen turned to run; others, knowing the consequences of turning their backs on cavalry, drew their swords.[90]\\r\\nAt 11:17, half of the original 250 men of the 17th and 13th reached Obolensky's battery. Some of the survivors fought with the Russians and tried to capture their guns; others reformed into small groups and prepared to charge the Russian cavalry standing 100 yards (~90 m) to the rear. Ryzhov had expected to mop up any Light Brigade survivors but his hussars and Cossacks, unnerved by the British horsemen, panicked and wheeled to escape. \\"Some of the men fired on their own comrades to clear a passage for themselves,\\" wrote Lieutenant Kubitovich. \\"Our hussars were pressed as far as the Chernaya river where there was only one bridge by which they could escape.\\"[91] The 11th Hussars now joined the mle. Colonel Douglass, with 80 survivors, charged and pushed other Russian cavalry back to the Chernaya. Paget's 4th Light Dragoons were next to reach the line of cannon, engaging in some 'fierce hand-to-hand encounters' with the surviving gunners, before he too led his regiment after the fleeing Russians. Last to reach the objective were Colonel Shewell and the 8th Hussars. The regiment missed the battery altogether, except for few on the extreme left who went amongst the remaining artillerymen stubbornly resisting; but the bulk of the regiment halted behind the guns and formed up in line.[92]\\r\\nAll the survivors of the Light Brigade were now behind the Russian guns in the valley, yet the turning point of the action was the realisation that Lucan and the Heavy Brigade was not following in support.[93] Russian officers, noticing how vastly superior their numbers were, managed to halt their retreat near the Chernaya, and edge forward their men. The Russian lancer regiments waiting on heights were now ordered down into the valley to form a line behind the British (the 13th, 17th, and 8th on the right of the valley, the 11th and 4th on the left) and block their route of escape. Those watching with Raglan thought the Light Brigade completely lost, but unexpectedly the two groups of survivors managed to break through the Russian trap. Still far from the British line, however, they once again came under fire from the guns and marksmen on the Causeway Heights. \\"The truth must be told,\\" recorded Lieutenant Koribut Kubitovich, \\"that this fire hit us just as it did the enemy,\\" but admitted that, \\"The English fought with astounding bravery, and when we approached their dismounted and wounded men, even these refused to surrender and continued to fight till the ground was soaked with their blood.\\"[94]\\r\\nMost of the survivors were back at the British lines by 12:00; the whole affair had lasted no more than 20 minutes. For those that returned there was a mixture of elation and anger, and questions as to what had happened to the Heavy Brigade. \\"And who I ask is answerable for all this?\\" wrote Troop Sergeant Major George Smith of the 11th Hussars. \\" it was not unlike leaving the forlorn hope, after storming a town, to fight their own way out again instead of pushing on the supports. We cut their army completely in two, taking their principal battery, driving their cavalry far to the rear. What more could 670 men do?\\"[95] But as they thought over what had occurred, the recriminations between Raglan, Lucan, and Cardigan had already begun.[96]\\r\\nThe loss of the Light Brigade had been such a traumatic event that the allies were incapable of further action that day.[97] Of the 666 men known to have ridden in the charge (sources vary slightly),[98] 271 became casualties: 110 killed (less than 17%), 129 wounded, plus another 32 wounded and taken prisoner. Additionally, 375 horses were killed.[99] Raglan could not now risk using his infantry divisions in any attempt to move Liprandi's forces from the Causeway Heights. Even if the redoubts were retaken, they would have to be defended by men whose priority was the siege of Sevastopol, and he dared not expose his supply base at Balaclava to further Russian attacks. The British 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions, therefore, returned to the plateau, the former without its Highland regiments who were ordered to remain in the valley under Campbells command.[100]\\r\\nTo the Russians the Battle of Balaclava was a victory and proved a welcome boost in moralethey had captured the British redoubts (from which seven guns were removed and taken to Sevastopol as trophies), and had gained control of the Worontsov Road.[101] The loss of the outer ring of defences severely restricted Allied movements and confined them to a narrow area between Balaclava and Sevastopol. Nearly all officers received awards. General Semyakin received the Order of St. George of the 3rd degree. Gribbe and Levutsky became the cavaliers of the Order of St Stanislav of the 1st degree, and Colonel Krudener was promoted to Major General. General Liprandi was awarded a golden sabre encrusted with diamonds, and inscribed 'For Bravery'.[102] Semyakin wrote home with news of the action at Balaclava, and what he considered a great success ÿ \\"Many Turks and English were killed by our Russian bayonets, and many English were pierced with lances of our Uhlans and Cossacks, and by sabres of our Hussars  God grant that the heart of the Tsar rejoices.\\"[103]\\r\\nAll three armies would soon be reinforced: the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, The Duke of Newcastle, promised Raglan that the 3rd, 62nd, and 90th Regiments, would be despatched to the Crimea with a third battery train; Canrobert, meanwhile, was promised an additional three divisions of infantry from France. The Russians were also receiving reinforcements with the arrival of 10 and 11 Divisions which finally arrived at the beginning of November. These troops brought the strength of Menshikov's field army to some 107,000 men, but the Russian commander was under severe pressure from St Petersburg to attack the Allied lines and break the siege of Sevastopol.[104] The failure of the British and French to beat the Russians at Balaclava immediately set the stage for a much bloodier battle.[105] For weeks it had been known that the Russians would soon begin a full-scale attack on the besiegers. As a preliminary Menshikov launched a reconnaissance in force on the extreme right of the Allied line (against the British 2nd Division) on the Inkerman Heights overlooking the Chernaya river. The attack on 26 October (the battle became known as Little Inkerman) proved a successful action for the British, but the Russians had gleaned all they needed to know about the position. Using this intelligence, Menshikov launched his main attack on the same position one week later on 5 November in what came to be known as the Battle of Inkerman.[106]","input":"How many british soldiers died in the battle of balaclava?"},{"output":"Samantha","context":"American Girl is an American line of 18-inch (46?cm) dolls released in 1986 by Pleasant Company. The dolls portray eight- to eleven-year-old girls of a variety of ethnicities. They are sold with accompanying books told from the viewpoint of the girls. Originally the stories focused on various periods of American history, but were expanded in 1995 to include contemporary characters and stories, the latest addition being WellieWishers, a line of 14.5-inch (37?cm) dolls aimed for younger children.\\r\\nProvided below is a list of characters from the Historical series (BeForever), Contemporary characters, the Girl of the Year line, and WellieWishers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BeForever characters (originally known as \\"The American Girls Collection\\" or, colloquially, \\"Historical Characters\\") were initially the main focus of Pleasant Company. This product line aims to teach aspects of American history through a six book series from the perspective of a nine-year-old girl living in that time period. Although the books are written for the eight-to-thirteen-year-old target market, they endeavor to cover topics such as child labor, child abuse, poverty, racism, slavery, alcoholism, animal abuse, and war in manners appropriate for the understanding and sensibilities of the company's target market.[1]\\r\\nThe first dolls in the American Girl/Historical line (Samantha, Kirsten and Molly) shared the same face mold but had different hair and eye colors. The first dolls were created with white muslin bodies, but these cloth bodies were changed in 1991 from a white muslin to a matching flesh tone. This accommodated the low necklines of Late Colonial/Revolutionary period gowns produced for the Felicity Merriman character (also introduced in 1991). Additional face molds were later developed for other dolls, and the line to date includes ten characters covering the period 1764 to 1974.\\r\\nThe \\"Best Friends\\" line was introduced in 2004; supplemental characters from the core book series were created in doll form and marketed as \\"best friends\\" for some of the Historical Characters. These Best Friend dolls share the collections of the main characters, but each has her own book, and additional products were marketed under their names.[2] However, in May 2014, American Girl announced that Ruthie, along with Ivy, Ccile and Marie-Grace, will be retired from their historical roster, citing business reasons as they decided \\"to move away from the character-friend strategy within the line\\".[3][4]\\r\\nA reboot of the Historical Characters line dubbed as BeForever was launched in August 2014, complete with redesigned outfits, a two-volume compilation of previously-released books, and a \\"Journey Book\\" for each character, with players taking the role of a present-day girl who found her way to the past and met up with one of the Historical girls. The line also coincided with the relaunch of Samantha Parkington, whose collection was previously discontinued in 2008.[5][6]\\r\\nKaya is a young girl from the Nimiipuu or Nez Perce tribe living in the pre-contact Northwest. Themes in her core series focus on leadership, compassion, courage, and attachment. Chronologically, Kaya's adventures are the earliest of the historical characters. Kaya is depicted as brave and outgoing, but careless and thoughtless, and wants to be a leader of her people. Her role model is a female warrior named Swan Circling. Created in collaboration with a consultation team that included representatives from the Nez Perce tribe,[7] Kaya is the only Native American doll made by American Girl to date. Kaya is the only doll in the series not to show teeth, per tribal custom. Kaya is also the first doll in the series to not follow the book naming customs established by previously-released characters ÿ the second book in the series is titled Kaya's Escape instead of Kaya Learns a Lesson.[8]\\r\\nFelicity Merriman is an auburn haired, horse-loving girl living in Williamsburg, Virginia, who is caught between Patriot and Loyalist family and friends at the onset of the American Revolution. Themes in her core books include loyalty and staying true to one's ideals.\\r\\nFelicity is depicted as spunky, brave, and free-spirited, and is often fed up with the customs that young women are expected to observe at the time, much to her mother's disappointment. She can be a little brash, impatient and foolish sometimes, and sets her heart on things often. She is also quite outspoken, but will stand up to bullies, as she did with Jiggy Nye. Felicity also is not afraid to tease Annabelle, Elizabeth's older sister, coming up with the name \\"Bananabelle\\". She eventually learns to be more ladylike throughout the series; however, she is still quite active.\\r\\nMany items from Felicity's collection were retired in the early 2000s, but when Felicity's core books were dramatized for Felicity: An American Girl Adventure on November 29, 2005, new products were introduced in her collection. On August 27, 2010, American Girl announced on its website that the Felicity and Elizabeth collection would be archived. On March 28, 2011, Felicity, Elizabeth and their respective collections were officially archived. In February 2017 Felicity was re-introduced as part of BeForever.[9]\\r\\nElizabeth Cole is Felicity's best friend, despite her Loyalist family leanings during the American Revolution. In spite of being quiet and shy, she is known to poke fun at her older sister Annabelle with Felicity ÿ this stems from being teased at by Annabelle, who gave her younger sister the nickname \\"Bitsy\\". Elizabeth is also shown to be somewhat wealthier, as evidenced by having a larger home, and a larger garden.\\r\\nThe Elizabeth doll was introduced in August 2005 as the second Best Friend doll with a book written by author Valerie Tripp, and the character was prominently featured in Felicity: An American Girl Adventure. In the original Felicity book illustrations, Elizabeth had brown hair and eyes but the character's appearance was revised to have blue eyes and blonde hair with the release of the Felicity DVD and Elizabeth doll. Later editions of the Felicity books were re-illustrated to reflect these changes and edit Elizabeth's physical description.[10] On August 27, 2010, American Girl announced that Elizabeth and her collection would be archived with Felicity, which took place in March 2011.\\r\\nCaroline Abbott is a girl from Sackets Harbor, New York.[11] The only daughter of a shipbuilder who owned a shipyard near Lake Ontario, Caroline enjoys outdoor activities, like sailing and ice-skating, and dreams of one day having her own ship like her father. One day, when her father is captured, Caroline embarks on a journey to save him and unite her family. Themes include bravery, family, and making wise decisions. Caroline was archived along with her collection in 2015.\\r\\nJosefina Montoya is a young Mexican girl living in New Mexico with her extended family. She and her family (including her oldest sister, Ana who is married to Tomas and has two sons, and her two other sisters, vain and headstrong Francisca and practical and sensible Clara) must adapt following the death of their mother and the introduction of their mother's sister, Ta Dolores (who later marries Josefina's widowed father), to the family circle. Josefina dreams of becoming a healer like her grandmother and is taught in this by her aunt, Magdalena, her father's sister. Josefina has a pet goat named Sombrita. Themes include adjustment to loss, day-to-day life of the Mexican people, and the cultural and societal changes and influences that occurred once Mexico opened trade routes with the US. Josefina's family speaks Spanish and there are Spanish words and phrases in her books which are defined in the glossary.\\r\\nMarie-Grace Gardner is a girl from New Orleans. Similar to Josefina, her mother died before the events of the series. She makes a friend with Ccile Rey in her first days in New Orleans, although the latter was not interested at first. However, changes are in the air. Soon, Marie-Grace's singing teacher is found sick with yellow fever. Her father, who is a doctor, saves not only the teacher, but others in his aid. She also rescues a baby and forms a close bond with other children. Themes include the loss of family and caring for others in need. Both Marie-Grace and Ccile were archived in summer 2014. Though Marie-Grace and Ccile Rey were best friends, they shared the same level of importance and a few items in their collection as well as a book, unlike other Best Friend characters.\\r\\nCcile Rey is from a bilingual rich French-African-American family that originated from France. She loves listening to her grandfather's tales about the sea. She meets Marie-Grace during one of her singing lessons. At first, she is not fond of her because she is white, but eventually warms up to her and becomes her best friend. When Yellow Fever strikes her brother, she decides to use her gifts to help him and others. Themes include the loss of family and caring for others in need, and volunteering. Cecile speaks French and her French words are described in the glossary in the back of her book. Though Ccile Rey and Marie-Grace were best friends, they shared the same level of importance and a few items in their collection as well as a book, unlike other Best Friend characters. Cecile was also the second African-American character made by American Girl.\\r\\nKirsten Larson is a Swedish immigrant who settles in the Minnesota Territory with her extended family. She faces the hardships, challenges, and adaptations necessary to adjust to life in America such as learning to speak English. More changes include making a new friend outside of her own \\"world\\" and the arrival of a new baby. Kirsten was one of the first three dolls produced by American Girl in 1986. Unlike many of the dolls, Kirsten's books have maintained their original illustrations (with the exception of the covers). Kirsten was officially archived on the American Girl website on January 1, 2010.[12]\\r\\nAddy Walker was the fifth doll added to the Historical line and the company's first African-American character. Her character is a fugitive slave who escapes with her mother from a plantation in North Carolina to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the American Civil War. Addy's stories explore themes of freedom, familial love, prejudice and racism. The six-book series was written by Connie Porter and originally illustrated by Melodye Rosales and Bradford Brown, but were later redrawn by Dahl Taylor. A stage adaptation of Porter's Addy book series was commissioned and produced by the Seattle Children's Theater in 2007.[14] Addy: An American Girl Story was subsequently taken on limited national tour from January through May 2008 through Kids Entertainment, Inc.\\r\\nSamantha is an only child growing up during the Edwardian period (although American Girl designated her as Victorian). Orphaned at age five and raised by her wealthy Victorian-era grandmother, Mary Edwards, whom she called Grandmary, in fictional Mount Bedford, New York, Samantha befriends a poor servant girl named Nellie O'Malley. Eventually Samantha, Nellie and Nellie's young sisters are adopted by Samantha's uncle Gardner Edwards and aunt Cornelia. The themes of Samantha's books include women's suffrage, child labor, and classism. Red Om Productions produced Samantha: An American Girl Holiday, in cooperation with American Girl. The show premiered on WB Television Network in November 2004 and was released to DVD soon thereafter. American Girl introduced the concept of \\"archiving\\" in October 2008 when it announced plans to cease production of Samantha and her collection (including Nellie). Samantha was then officially archived on May 31, 2009, but was later re-introduced in August 2014 as part of the BeForever reboot.[16][17]\\r\\nNellie O'Malley, Samantha's best friend, is an Irish immigrant who works for Samantha's neighbors and is befriended by Samantha. She personifies the working-class immigrant experience of the time and teaches Samantha about the conditions faced by children who are part of the work force. Nellie and her sisters, Bridget and Jenny, are orphaned and later adopted by Samantha's relatives, Gardner and Cornelia Edwards. In 2004, American Girl introduced a new line of Best Friend dolls with Nellie O'Malley debuting as Samantha's Best Friend in conjunction with the Samantha DVD release. Nellie was marketed with a small collection of clothing and a book written by Valerie Tripp, Nellie's Promise, which chronicles the character's growth and adjustment to her recent adoption. As Nellie was part of Samantha's collection, she was archived at the same time as Samantha, and with the release of the BeForever reboot and American Girl's decision to move away from the Best Friends line, at present it is unlikely for Nellie to be re-released.\\r\\nRebecca Rubin, American Girl's tenth historical character, debuted on May 31, 2009. She is a ten-year-old Jewish girl of Russian descent whose maternal grandparents and parents immigrated to the Lower East Side of New York City. Rebecca is fascinated by both various new American customs and the then-budding film industry, and aspires to become an actress despite her family's disapproval, though she still treasures and celebrates her family's Jewish traditions. Her six book series was written by Jacqueline Dembar Greene and focuses on issues related to assimilation of immigrants while maintaining familial, religious, and cultural traditions. Rebecca is the first Jewish Historical Character, however she is the second Jewish character made by American Girl.\\r\\nKit Kittredge faces the hard times of the early-to-mid years of the Great Depression in Cincinnati, Ohio, as her family struggles to adjust to the realities of the economy after her father's job loss.\\r\\nKit was named after her mother and her Aunt Millie.[18] Unlike her best friend Ruthie, Kit is a tomboy who cares less about dresses, chores and things that she considers as \\"flouncy\\", and is more inclined toward baseball, especially Ernie Lombardi of the Cincinnati Reds, the great outdoors, such as country life, and typing up her own news reports. Kit hates change, and dislikes being dependent on charities, instead preferring to learn how to catch the big fish herself, which spurs her fascination with Amelia Earhart. She dreams of becoming a reporter one day. The books also depict her as being stubborn and somewhat fussy, as she finds chores around the house to be rather boring and tedious, but eventually regrets it after realizing her family's misfortunes, and learns to be more supportive and helpful.\\r\\nKit's core series of books was written by Valerie Tripp and illustrated by Walter Rane. A feature film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl was released to theaters on July 2, 2008, starring Abigail Breslin in the title role. Many new items were added to Kit's collection as product tie-ins to the movie. Two video games based on her stories were also developed and published, namely Kit Mystery Challenge for the Nintendo DS,[19] and the point-and-click adventure game A Tree House of My Own for Microsoft Windows platforms.[20]\\r\\nRuthie Smithens is Kit Kittredge's best friend. The only daughter of a banker, Ruthie (and her family) is not financially affected by the Depression. Although they did at times offer help to the Kittredges, it was mostly in ways that would not hurt their pride. She is depicted to have an affinity for princesses and fairy tales, most especially Andrew Lang's Fairy Books and Grimms' Fairy Tales, in contrast to Kit's more tomboyish personality. Despite their major differences, Ruthie is a loyal and courageous friend who will go to great lengths to help Kit.\\r\\nRuthie, along with Ivy, Ccile and Marie-Grace, was retired in August 2014 following the company's decision to discontinue the Best Friends line.[3]\\r\\nNanea Mitchell is the sixteenth historical character and the 3rd BeForever exclusive. She is from the Hawaiian island of O'ahu growing up in the early 1940's representing the bombings at Pearl Harbor that ushered the U.S. out of The Great Depression and into World War II. She may be the youngest in her Ohana (family), but she still wants to \\"dip her paddle in\\" and be useful. But before she can prove that she is ready for more responsibility, Japan attacks the military base in Pearl Harbor where her father works. Will her life ever be the same again with America now involved with the war?\\r\\nMolly McIntire is a young girl living in a fictional city named Jefferson, Illinois during the later years of World War II. Her father is stationed in England as a doctor caring for wounded soldiers, and her mother works at the Red Cross. She, her 15-year-old sister, Jill, her 13-year-old brother, Ricky and her 6-year-old brother, Brad, are all cared for by their housekeeper, Mrs. Gilford, and she must cope with the many changes that the war has brought. Molly also realizes that she, too, has a part of helping soldiers. Despite those changes, Molly has some leisure activities as well, such as skating, tap-dancing, movies and summer camp. Molly's series focuses on patriotism and the changes that come with wartime. Molly was one of the original three dolls offered by Pleasant Company and is the only doll to be sold with eyeglasses. In early July 2013, American Girl announced plans to archive Molly and Emily. Both were archived on December 31, 2013.\\r\\nEmily Bennett is a British girl who is sent to America by her family to protect her from the intensity of the English battlefront during World War II. Originally a minor character temporarily residing with the McIntires in the book Happy Birthday, Molly!, Emily's character was expanded in a book by Valerie Tripp called Brave Emily for her debut as the third doll in the Best Friends collection on September 5, 2006.[14] Emily's debut coincided with the premiere of the Molly made-for-TV movie. Since Emily is a minor character and not Molly's best friend, she was marketed instead as \\"Molly's English friend\\". As Emily is a part of Molly's collection, she was archived along with Molly.\\r\\nMaryellen Larkin is the fourteenth Historical Character by American Girl, representing the 1950s.[25] She was released on August 27, 2015, and is the first exclusive BeForever character, and was made to replace Caroline Abbott.[26] Hailing from Daytona Beach, Florida, Maryellen is an enthusiastic and imaginative girl, longing to stand out but often feels lost in the shuffle of her big, busy family.[27] Her favorite TV shows include Davy Crockett and The Lone Ranger, and she dreams up episodes where she gets to be the hero. Maryellen has strawberry-blonde hair with bangs up in a ponytail and green eyes. All three of her books, written by Valerie Tripp, were released on August 27, 2015.[28]\\r\\nA short film based on her stories, with newcomer Harlie Galloway playing the title character, was uploaded on the video sharing site YouTube in November 2015 as part of American Girl's venture into digital content and independent film production.[23] In addition to the short, a direct-to-video special entitled An American Girl Story - Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas, starring Alyvia Alyn Lind as Maryellen Larkin and was released by Amazon to Prime subscribers on November 25, 2016.[24][29]\\r\\nMelody Ellison is a nine-year-old African-American girl living with her family in Detroit, Michigan, during the civil rights movement in the early 1960s.[31][32][33] Her parents are Will, who works in an auto assembly line, and Frances. Frances' parents (Melody's grandparents) are Frank Porter, a florist; and \\"Big Momma\\" Porter, who teaches piano and voice. Melody's older brother, Dwayne, wants to be a Motown singer;[34] her oldest sister, Yvonne, is a student at Tuskegee University; her sister, Lila, is in middle school and lives at home.\\r\\nIn her character's first book, No Ordinary Sound, Melody's cousins move to Detroit from Alabama; this is when Melody learns more of racial prejudice. When the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing occurs, Melody becomes fearful of going into her church, because the four little girls were in their church when they died. In time, Melody overcomes her fear.[35]\\r\\nThe first book was released in January 2016, although the doll wasn't released until summer 2016; a preview of the Melody doll was aired in CBS News in February 2016.[32] The book's advisory board included: JoAnn Watson, NAACP executive committee member; Gloria House, professor of African American Studies at the University of Michigan, Dearborn; Thomas Sugrue, professor of history at New York University; and the late Julian Bond, former NAACP chairman.\\r\\nA live-action web special based on her stories entitled Melody, 1963: Love Has to Win, an American Girl Story was released by Amazon Studios, starring Marsai Martin as the title character.[30][36]\\r\\nJolie Ledford[23]\\r\\nJulie Albright is a young girl growing up in San Francisco, California in 1974-75. Her six book series, written by Megan McDonald and illustrated by Robert Hunt, focuses on various changes and societal upheavals in American society during that time period: divorce, feminism, gender equality in school sports, environmentalism, and the disability rights movement. The America's Bicentennial celebration is also emphasized later in the series. Julie was released September 10, 2007 and is the first character portrayed from a divorced family by American Girl. In 2008, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas reported that she was outlining a movie proposal based on Julie's story[37] In December 2009, Julie: An American Girl Musical was officially announced as a planned theatrical release;[38] as of 2015, little, if any, development has been made over the musical. In lieu of this, a short independent film was uploaded on American Girl's YouTube account, starring Jolie Ledford in the title role.[23]\\r\\nGrace Liu\\r\\nIvy Ling, Julie's best friend, is a Chinese American girl living in San Francisco. Good Luck, Ivy by Lisa Yee focuses on Ivy's conflict with her love of gymnastics and family traditions and responsibilities, and its \\"Looking Back\\" section discusses Chinese-American history. The Ivy doll debuted with Julie and was the first Best Friend doll to be released at the same time as the main character. Ivy was and still is the only Asian American Historical character.\\r\\nIntroduced in 2017, the Contemporary Characters line features characters and stories set in the present day, but unlike the limited edition Girl of the Year dolls, they are available for at least a few years before being discontinued. The line also marks the introduction of an 18-inch boy doll in the American Girl series, although the Bitty Baby and Bitty Twin lines have had boy dolls in their respective collections.\\r\\nHailing from Nashville, Tennessee, Tenney Grant is an aspiring young songwriter who dreams to express herself through music.[39] The eponymous first book in the series by Kellen Hertz focuses on her efforts at songwriting and the opportunity to perform at the famed Bluebird Cafe. Unlike dolls from the Girl of the Year line, Tenney, along with Logan Everett, are marketed as regular characters to be sold for an extended period of time than as limited edition dolls sold only for a year before being discontinued.\\r\\nTenney's sidekick and bandmate, Logan Everett is, in a break from series tradition, the first 18-inch boy doll from American Girl. Released alongside the main character, he is depicted as a drummer for Tenney's band, and as with Tenney, the Logan doll also comes with a modified hand to hold musical instruments.[39]\\r\\nStarting in 2001, American Girl began producing a \\"Girl of the Year\\" doll that was exclusive to that year. Lindsey was on sale from 2001 to mid-2002 but a 2002 doll was not produced due to lack of sales. Then Kailey was on sale from 2003-mid-2004. After that they were exclusively produced and on sale only during the year of their origination. The Girl of the Year is available until December 31, or until supplies last. Lindsey Bergman and Kailey Hopkins were Girl of the Year for two years ÿ the rest, starting from 2005 by Marisol Luna, were each Girl of the Year for only one year. Starting in 2009, the Girl of the Year dolls were accompanied by films to tie in with their release. Since Kanani in 2011, every character has an additional mobile app.\\r\\nDescribed as a girl \\"who is eager to help\\", Lindsey's self-titled book details the difficulties her impulsive attempts at helping with causes.

In terms of tissue type, the body may be analyzed into water, fat, muscle, bone, etc. In terms of cell type, the body contains hundreds of different types of cells, but notably, the largest number of cells contained in a human body (though not the largest mass of cells) are not human cells, but bacteria residing in the normal human gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium. All 11 are necessary for life. The remaining elements are trace elements, of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary for life. All of the mass of the trace elements put together (less than 10 grams for a human body) do not add up to the body mass of magnesium, the least common of the 11 non-trace elements.\\r\\nNot all elements which are found in the human body in trace quantities play a role in life. Some of these elements are thought to be simple bystander contaminants without function (examples: caesium, titanium), while many others are thought to be active toxics, depending on amount (cadmium, mercury, radioactives). The possible utility and toxicity of a few elements at levels normally found in the body (aluminium) is debated. Functions have been proposed for trace amounts of cadmium and lead, although these are almost certainly toxic in amounts very much larger than normally found in the body. There is evidence that arsenic, an element normally considered a toxic in higher amounts, is essential in ultratrace quantities, in mammals such as rats, hamsters, and goats.[1]\\r\\nSome elements (silicon, boron, nickel, vanadium) are probably needed by mammals also, but in far smaller doses. Bromine is used abundantly by some (though not all) lower organisms, and opportunistically in eosinophils in humans. One study has found bromine to be necessary to collagen IV synthesis in humans.[2] Fluorine is used by a number of plants to manufacture toxins (see that element) but in humans only functions as a local (topical) hardening agent in tooth enamel, and not in an essential biological role.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe average 70?kg (150?lb) adult human body contains approximately 7027700000000000000?7G1027 atoms and contains at least detectable traces of 60 chemical elements.[3] About 29 of these elements are thought to play an active positive role in life and health in humans.[4]\\r\\nThe relative amounts of each element vary by individual, mainly due to differences in the proportion of fat, muscle and bone in their body. Persons with more fat will have a higher proportion of carbon and a lower proportion of most other elements (the proportion of hydrogen will be about the same). The numbers in the table are averages of different numbers reported by different references.\\r\\nThe adult human body averages ~53% water. This varies substantially by age, sex, and adiposity. In a large sample of adults of all ages and both sexes, the figure for water fraction by weight was found to be 48 I6% for females and 58 I8% water for males.[5] Water is ~11% hydrogen by mass but ~67% hydrogen by atomic percent, and these numbers along with the complementary?% numbers for oxygen in water, are the largest contributors to overall mass and atomic composition figures. Because of water content, the human body contains more oxygen by mass than any other element, but more hydrogen by atom-fraction than any element.\\r\\nThe elements listed below as \\"Essential in humans\\" are those listed by the (US) Food and Drug Administration as essential nutritients,[6] as well as six additional elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (the fundamental building blocks of life on Earth), sulfur (essential to all cells) and cobalt (a necessary component of vitamin B12). Elements listed as \\"Possibly\\" or \\"Probably\\" essential are those cited by the National Research Council (United States) as beneficial to human health and possibly or probably essential.[7]\\r\\n*Iron = ~3 g in men, ~2.3 g in women\\r\\nMost of the elements needed for life are relatively common in the Earth's crust. Aluminium, the third most common element in the Earth's crust (after oxygen and silicon), serves no function in living cells, but is harmful in large amounts.[29] Transferrins can bind aluminium.[30]\\r\\nOf the 94 naturally occurring chemical elements, 60 are listed in the table above.

It connects Knight's Key (part of the city of Marathon, Florida) in the Middle Keys to Little Duck Key in the Lower Keys. Among the longest bridges in existence when it was built, it is part of the Overseas Highway in the Keys, which is part of the 2,369-mile U.S. Route 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two bridges in this location. The modern bridge is open to vehicular traffic; the older one only to pedestrians and cyclists. The older bridge, originally known as the Knights Key-Pigeon Key-Moser Channel-Pacet Channel Bridge, was constructed from 1909 to 1912 under the direction of Henry Flagler and Clarence S. Coe as part of the Florida East Coast Railway's Key West Extension, also known as the Overseas Railroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the railroad was damaged by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, the line was sold to the United States government, which refurbished Seven Mile Bridge for automobile use. Unsupported sections were added in 1935 to widen it for vehicular traffic. Dismantled trackage was recycled, painted white, and used as guardrails. It had a swing span to allow passage of boats in the Moser Channel of the Intracoastal Waterway, near where the bridge crosses Pigeon Key, a small island that held a work camp for Flagler's railroad. Hurricane Donna in 1960 caused further damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current road bridge was constructed from 1978 to 1982.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast majority of the original bridge still exists, although the swing span has been removed. The 2.2-mile section to Pigeon Key, used as a fishing pier and long open to motorized vehicles to give access to the key, was closed to motorized traffic in 2008 after the unsupported sections began to sag. As of  2015[update], the section remains open to pedestrians and bicyclists.[2][3] In 2014, the Florida Department of Transportation approved a $77 million plan to restore the old bridge.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new bridge is a box-girder structure built from precast, prestressed concrete sections, comprising 440 spans. Near the center, the bridge rises in an arc to provide 65-foot (20?m)-high clearance for boat passage. The remainder of the bridge is considerably closer to the water surface. The new bridge does not cross Pigeon Key.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total length of the new bridge is actually 35,862?ft (10,931?m) or 6.79 miles (10.93?km), and is shorter than the original.  The bridge carries the Florida Keys aqueduct, supplying water to points west, as well as fiber optic cables, providing telecommunications to and from the lower Keys.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach April, the bridge is closed for about 2.5 hours on a Saturday to allow the Seven Mile Bridge Run, a \\"fun run\\" of some 1,500 runners that commemorates the Florida Keys bridge rebuilding project. The event began in 1982 to commemorate the completion of a federally funded bridge building program that replaced spans that oil tycoon Henry Flagler constructed in the early 1900s to serve as a foundation for his Overseas Railroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seven Mile Bridge was engineered by Figg & Muller Engineers (who also engineered the much taller Sunshine Skyway Bridge). The structure was completed six months ahead of schedule and has earned eight awards, including an Exceptional Award for Cost Savings Innovation from the Federal Highway Administration.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge has been featured in films and television series, such as Licence to Kill,[7] True Lies,[8][9] 2 Fast 2 Furious,[10] and Burn Notice.

HFCS was first marketed in the early 1970s by the Clinton Corn Processing Company, together with the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and Technology where the enzyme was discovered in 1965.[3]:5\\r\\nAs a sweetener, HFCS is often compared to granulated sugar, but manufacturing advantages of HFCS over sugar include that it is easier to handle and more cost-effective.[4] The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing.[5] There is debate over whether HFCS presents greater health risks than other sweeteners.[6] Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have continued to grow during the early 21st century.[7]\\r\\nApart from comparisons between HFCS and table sugar, there is some evidence that the overconsumption of added sugar in any form, including HFCS, is a major health problem, especially for onset of obesity.[4][8][9] Consuming added sugars, particularly as sweetened soft drinks, is strongly linked to weight gain.[4][10] The World Health Organization has recommended that people limit their consumption of added sugars to 10% of calories, but experts say that typical consumption of empty calories in the United States is nearly twice that level.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., HFCS is among the sweeteners that mostly replaced sucrose (table sugar) in the food industry.[11] Factors in the rise of HFCS use include production quotas of domestic sugar, import tariff on foreign sugar, and subsidies of U.S. corn, raising the price of sucrose and lowering that of HFCS, making it cheapest for many sweetener applications.[12][13] The relative sweetness of HFCS 55, used most commonly in soft drinks, is comparable to sucrose.[14] HFCS (and/or standard corn syrup) is the primary ingredient in most brands of commercial \\"pancake syrup\\", as a less expensive substitute for maple syrup.[15]\\r\\nBecause of its similar sugar profile and lower price, HFCS has been used illegally to \\"stretch\\" honey. Assays to detect adulteration with HFCS use differential scanning calorimetry and other advanced testing methods.[16][17]\\r\\nIn the contemporary process, corn is milled to extract corn starch and an \\"acid-enzyme\\" process is used, in which the corn-starch solution is acidified to begin breaking up the existing carbohydrates.[18] It is necessary to carry out the extraction process in the presence of mercuric chloride (0.01?M) in order to inhibit endogenous starch-degrading enzymes.[19]:374ÿ376 High-temperature enzymes are added to further metabolize the starch and convert the resulting sugars to fructose.[18]:808ÿ813 The first enzyme added is alpha-amylase, which breaks the long chains down into shorter sugar chains ÿ oligosaccharides. Glucoamylase is mixed in and converts them to glucose; the resulting solution is filtered to remove protein, then using activated carbon, and then demineralized using ion-exchange resins. The purified solution is then run over immobilized xylose isomerase, which turns the sugars to ~50ÿ52% glucose with some unconverted oligosaccharides and 42% fructose (HFCS 42), and again demineralized and again purified using activated carbon. Some is processed into HFCS 90 by liquid chromatography, then mixed with HFCS 42 to form HFCS 55. The enzymes used in the process are made by microbial fermentation.[18]:808ÿ813[3]:20ÿ22\\r\\nHFCS is 24% water, the rest being mainly fructose and glucose with 0ÿ5% unprocessed glucose oligomers.[20] There are several varieties of HFCS, numbered by the percentage of fructose they contain:\\r\\nCommercial production of corn syrup began in 1864.[3]:17 In the late 1950s, scientists at Clinton Corn Processing Company of Clinton, Iowa, tried to turn glucose from corn starch into fructose, but the process was not scalable.[3]:17[24] In 1965ÿ1970 Yoshiyuki Takasaki, at the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) developed a heat-stable xylose isomerase enzyme from yeast. In 1967, the Clinton Corn Processing Company obtained an exclusive license to a manufacture glucose isomerase derived from Streptomyces bacteria and began shipping an early version of HFCS in February 1967.[3]:140 In 1983, the FDA approved HFCS as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), and that decision was reaffirmed in 1996[25]\\r\\nPrior to the development of the worldwide sugar industry, dietary fructose was limited to only a few items. Milk, meats, and most vegetables, the staples of many early diets, have no fructose, and only 5ÿ10% fructose by weight is found in fruits such as grapes, apples, and blueberries. Most traditional dried fruits, however, contain about 50% fructose. From 1970 to 2000, there was a 25% increase in \\"added sugars\\" in the U.S.[26] After being classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1976,[27] HFCS began to replace sucrose as the main sweetener of soft drinks in the United States. At the same time, rates of obesity rose. That correlation, in combination with laboratory research and epidemiological studies that suggested a link between consuming large amounts of fructose and changes to various proxy health measures, including elevated blood triglycerides, size and type of low-density lipoproteins, uric acid levels, and weight, raised concerns about health effects of HFCS itself.[20]\\r\\nIn the U.S., sugar tariffs and quotas keep imported sugar at up to twice the global price since 1797,[28] while subsidies to corn growers cheapen the primary ingredient in HFCS, corn. Industrial users looking for cheaper replacements rapidly adopted HFCS in the 1970s.[29][30]\\r\\nHFCS is easier to handle than granulated sucrose, although some sucrose is transported as solution. Unlike sucrose, HFCS cannot be hydrolyzed, but the free fructose in HFCS may produce hydroxymethylfurfural when stored at high temperatures; these differences are most prominent in acidic beverages.[31] Soft drink makers such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi continue to use sugar in other nations but transitioned to HFCS for U.S. markets in 1980 before completely switching over in 1984.[32] Large corporations, such as Archer Daniels Midland, lobby for the continuation of government corn subsidies.[33]\\r\\nConsumption of HFCS in the U.S. has declined since it peaked at 37.5?lb (17.0?kg) per person in 1999. The average American consumed approximately 27.1?lb (12.3?kg) of HFCS in 2012,[34] versus 39.0?lb (17.7?kg) of refined cane and beet sugar.[35][36] This decrease in domestic consumption of HFCS resulted in a push in exporting of the product. In 2014, exports of HFCS were valued at $436 million, a decrease of 21% in one year, with Mexico receiving about 75% of the export volume.[7]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Corn Refiners Association petitioned the FDA to call HFCS \\"corn sugar\\", but the petition was denied.[37]\\r\\nIn the European Union (EU), HFCS, known as isoglucose in sugar regime, is subject to a production quota. In 2005, this quota was set at 303,000 tons; in comparison, the EU produced an average of 18.6 million tons of sugar annually between 1999 and 2001.[38]\\r\\nIn Japan, HFCS is manufactured mostly from imported U.S. corn, and the output is regulated by the government. For the period from 2007 to 2012, HFCS had a 27ÿ30% share of the Japanese sweetener market.[39]\\r\\nHealth concerns have been raised about a relationship between HFCS and metabolic disorders, and with regard to manufacturing contaminants. In general, however, the United States Food and Drug Administration has declared HFCS as a safe ingredient in food manufacturing, and there is no evidence that retail HFCS products contain harmful compounds or cause diseases.[4][5]\\r\\nHFCS is composed of 76% carbohydrates and 24% water, containing no fat, no protein, and no essential nutrients in significant amounts (table). In a 100 gram serving, it supplies 281 Calories, whereas in one tablespoon of 19 grams, it supplies 53 Calories (table link).\\r\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s were publications cautioning consumption of sucrose and of HFCS.[3]:18[3]:18[40] In subsequent interviews, two of the study's authors stated the article was distorted to place emphasis solely on HFCS when the actual issue was the overconsumption of any type of sugar.[41][42] While fructose absorption and modification by the intestines and liver does differ from glucose initially, the majority of the fructose molecules are converted to glucose or metabolized into byproducts identical to those produced by glucose metabolism. Consumption of moderate amounts of fructose has also been linked to positive outcomes, including reducing appetite if consumed before a meal, lower blood sugar increases compared to glucose, and (again compared to glucose) delaying exhaustion if consumed during exercise.[20]\\r\\nIn 2007, an expert panel assembled by the University of Maryland's Center for Food, Nutrition and Agriculture Policy reviewed the links between HFCS and obesity and concluded there was no ecological validity in the association between rising body mass indexes (a measure of obesity) and the consumption of HFCS. The panel stated that since the ratio of fructose to glucose had not changed substantially in the United States since the 1960s when HFCS was introduced, the changes in obesity rates were probably not due to HFCS specifically, but rather a greater consumption of calories overall.[43] In 2009 the American Medical Association published a review article on HFCS and concluded it was unlikely that HFCS contributed more to obesity or other health conditions than sucrose, and there was insufficient evidence to suggest warning about or restricting use of HFCS or other fructose-containing sweeteners in foods. The review did report that while some studies found direct associations between high intakes of fructose and other sugars and adverse health outcomes, including obesity and the metabolic syndrome, there was insufficient evidence to ban or restrict use of HFCS in the food supply or to require warning labels on products containing HFCS.[44]\\r\\nEpidemiological research has suggested that the increase in metabolic disorders like obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is linked to increased consumption of sugars and/or calories in general and not due to any special effect of HFCS.[20][45][46] A 2014 systematic review found little evidence for an association between HFCS consumption and liver diseases, enzyme levels or fat content.[47] A 2012 review found that fructose did not appear to cause weight gain when it replaced other carbohydrates in diets with similar calories.[48] One study investigating HFCS as a possible contributor to diabetes and obesity states that, \\"As many of the metabolic consequences of a diet high in fructose-containing sugars in humans can also be observed with high-fat or high-glucose feeding, it is possible that excess calories may be the main culprit in the development of the metabolic syndrome.\\"[49] Another study compared similar intakes of honey, white cane sugar, and HFCS, showing similar rises in both blood sugar level and triglycerides.[50] High fructose consumption has been linked to high levels of uric acid in the blood, though this is only thought to be a concern for patients with gout.[20]\\r\\nNumerous agencies in the United States recommend reducing the consumption of all sugars, including HFCS, without singling it out as presenting extra concerns. The Mayo Clinic cites the American Heart Association's recommendation that women limit the added sugar in their diet to 100 calories a day (~6 teaspoons) and that men limit it to 150 calories a day (~9 teaspoons), noting that there is not enough evidence to support HFCS having more adverse health effects than excess consumption of any other type of sugar.[51][52] The United States departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services recommendations for a healthy diet state that consumption of all types of added sugars be reduced.[53]:p.27\\r\\nPeople with fructose malabsorption should avoid foods containing HFCS.[54]\\r\\nSince 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared HFCS to be safe as a food ingredient.[5] In 2015, production of HFCS in the United States was 8.5 million tons from some 500 million bushels of corn.[55]\\r\\nOne consumer concern about HFCS is that processing of corn is more complex than used for simpler or more natural sugars, such as fruit juice concentrates or agave nectar, but all sweetener products derived from raw materials involve similar processing steps of pulping, hydrolysis, enzyme treatment, and filtration, among other common steps of sweetener manufacturing from natural sources.[4][55][56] In the contemporary process to make HFCS, an \\"acid-enzyme\\" step is used in which the cornstarch solution is acidified to digest the existing carbohydrates, then enzymes are added to further metabolize the cornstarch and convert the resulting sugars to their constituents of fructose and glucose.[55][56] Analyses published in 2014 showed that HFCS content of fructose was consistent across samples from 80 randomly selected carbonated beverages sweetened with HFCS.[57]\\r\\nOne prior concern in manufacturing was whether HFCS contains reactive carbonyl compounds or advanced glycation end-products evolved during processing.[58] This concern was dismissed, however, with evidence that HFCS poses no dietary risk from these compounds.[4]\\r\\nThrough the early 21st Century, some factories manufacturing HFCS had used a chlor-alkali corn processing method which, in cases of applying mercury cell technology for digesting corn raw material, left trace residues of mercury in some batches of HFCS.[59] In a 2009 release,[60] The Corn Refiners Association stated that all factories in the American industry for manufacturing HFCS had used mercury-free processing over several previous years, making the prior report outdated.[59] As of 2017, the USDA, FDA and US Centers for Disease Control list HFCS as a safe food ingredient, and do not mention mercury as a safety concern in HFCS products.[5][55][61]\\r\\nSome countries, including Mexico, use sucrose, or table sugar, in soft drinks. In the U.S., soft drinks, including Coca-Cola, are typically made with HFCS. Some Americans seek out drinks such as Mexican Coca-Cola in ethnic groceries because they prefer the taste over that of HFCS-sweetened Coca-Cola.[62][63] Kosher Coca-Cola, sold in the U.S. around the Jewish holiday of Passover, also uses sucrose rather than HFCS and is highly sought after by people who prefer the original taste.[64] While these are simply opinions, a 2011 study further backed up the idea that people enjoy sucrose (table sugar) more than HFCS. The study, conducted by Michigan State University, included a 99-member panel that evaluated yogurt sweetened with sucrose (table sugar), HFCS, and different varieties of honey for likeness. The results showed that, overall, the panel enjoyed the yogurt with sucrose (table sugar) added more than those that contained HFCS or honey.[65]\\r\\nIn apiculture in the United States, HFCS is a honey substitute for some managed honey bee colonies during times when nectar is in low supply.[66][67] However, when HFCS is heated to about 45?C (113?F), hydroxymethylfurfural, which is toxic to bees, can form from the breakdown of fructose.[68][69] Although some researchers cite honey substitution with HFCS as one factor among many for colony collapse disorder, there is no evidence that HFCS is the only cause.[66][67][70] Compared to hive honey, HFCS may be a deficiency in the diet for developing genes associated with protein metabolism and physiological benefits affecting bee health.[67]\\r\\nThere are various public relations concerns with HFCS, including how HFCS products are advertised and labeled as \\"natural.\\" As a consequence, several companies reverted to manufacturing with sucrose (table sugar) from products that had previously been made with HFCS.[71] In 2010, the Corn Refiners Association (CRA) applied to allow HFCS to be renamed \\"corn sugar\\", but that petition was rejected by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2012.[72]\\r\\nIn August 2016 in a move to please consumers with health concerns, McDonald's announced they would be replacing all HFCS in their buns with sucrose (table sugar) and would cut out preservatives and other artificial additives from their menu items.[73] Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald's stated, \\"We know that they [consumers] don't feel good about high-fructose corn syrup so we're giving them what they're looking for instead.\\"[73] Over the early 21st century, other companies such as Yoplait, Gatorade, and Hershey's also phased out HFCS, replacing it with conventional sugar because consumers perceived sugar to be healthier.[74][75] Companies such as PepsiCo and Heinz have also released products that use sugar in lieu of HFCS, although they still sell HFCS-sweetened products.[71][74]","input":"When did we start using high fructose corn syrup?"},{"output":"November 5, 1556","context":"The Second Battle of Panipat was fought on November 5, 1556, between the forces of Hemu, the Hindu general and Chief Minister of Adil Shah Suri, and the army of the Mughal emperor, Akbar. Hemu had conquered Delhi a month earlier by defeating the Mughals led by Tardi Beg Khan at the Battle of Delhi and proclaimed himself Raja Vikramaditya. Akbar and his guardian, Bairam Khan, had immediately marched to Delhi to reclaim the city. The two armies clashed at Panipat not far from the site of the First Battle of Panipat of 1526.\\r\\nAlthough Hemu had lost his artillery to the Mughals before the battle, his forces held the numerical superiority. However, Hemu was wounded by a chance arrow in the middle of the battle and fell unconscious. Seeing their leader going down, his army panicked and dispersed. Hemu was captured and subsequently beheaded. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Akbar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHumayun, the successor of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, had lost his inheritance when he was chased out of India by Sher Shah Suri who established the Sur Empire in 1540. Delhi and Agra fell into Sher Shah's hands, but he died soon after in 1545 at Kalinjar. He was succeeded by his younger son, Islam Shah Suri, who was a capable ruler. However, upon his death in 1553, the Sur Empire was caught up in a succession battle and was plagued by rebellion and the secession of provinces. Humayun made use of this discord to recapture what was lost and on 23 July 1555, the Mughals defeated Sikandar Shah Suri and finally regained control over Delhi and Agra.[2]\\r\\nIslam Shah's rightful successor, his 12-year-old son, Firoz Khan, had been murdered by his maternal uncle who had taken the throne as Adil Shah Suri. The new ruler was however, more interested in the pursuit of pleasure than in the affairs of his state. Those were largely left to Hemu, a Hindu from Rewari, who had risen from humble circumstances to become both Adil Shah's Chief Minister as well as the general of the Suri army.[3] He was in Bengal when Humayun died on 26 January 1556. The Mughal emperor's death provided an ideal opportunity to defeat the Mughals and reclaim lost territory.[4]\\r\\nHemu started a rapid march from Bengal and drove the Mughals out of Bayana, Etawah, Sambhal, Kalpi, and Narnaul.[4] In Agra, the governor evacuated the city and fled without a fight upon hearing of Hemu's impending invasion.[5] In pursuit of the governor, Hemu reached Tughlaqabad, a village just outside Delhi where he ran into the forces of the Mughal governor of Delhi, Tardi Beg Khan, and defeated them in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.[4] He took possession of Delhi after a day's battle on 7 October 1556[5] and claimed royal status assuming the title of Vikramaditya (or Bikramjit).[6]\\r\\nOn hearing the disastrous news from Tughlaqabad, Humayun's successor, the 13-year-old Akbar and his guardian Bairam Khan soon set off for Delhi. In a stroke of luck, Ali Quli Khan Shaibani (later Khan-i-Zaman), who had been sent ahead with 10,000-strong cavalry force, chanced upon Hemu's artillery which was being transported under a weak guard. He was easily able to capture the entire train of artillery from the Afghans who abandoned the guns and fled without making a stand. This would prove to be a costly loss for Hemu.[7][8]\\r\\nOn 5 November 1556, the Mughal army met Hemu's army at the historic battlefield of Panipat. Akbar and Bairam Khan stayed in the rear, eight miles from the battleground.[9]\\r\\nThe Mughal army was led by Ali Quli Khan Shaibani with his 10,000 cavalry in the centre with Sikandar Khan Uzbak on the right and Abdulla Khan Uzbak towards the left. The vanguard was led by Husain Quli Beg and Shah Quli Mahram and included Bairam Khan's detachment of Turks.[7]\\r\\nHemu's army was numerically superior counting among its ranks a 30,000-strong cavalry consisting of Rajput and Afghan horsemen and an elephant contingent numbering 500. Each war elephant was protected by plate armour and mounted by musketeers and crossbowmen. Hemu led his army himself into battle, atop an elephant named Hawai.[10] His left was led by his sister's son, Ramya, and the right by Shadi Khan Kakkar. His army was an experienced and confident lot and Hemu had, by this time, been victorious in 22 battles for Adil Shah. In this battle however, Hemu had no artillery.[12]\\r\\nTwo armies so collided\\r\\nThat they struck fire out of water;\\r\\nYou'd say the air was all crimsoned daggers,\\r\\nTheir steel had all become solid rubies.\\r\\nHemu began the attack himself and loosed his elephants among the right and left wings of the Mughals. Those soldiers who were able to escape the rampage, rather than retreating, chose to veer to the sides and attack the flanks of Hemu's cavalry, pelting them with their superior archery. The Mughal centre also advanced and took up a defensive position before a deep ravine. Neither Hemu's elephant nor his horse units were able to cross the chasm to reach their opponents and were vulnerable to the projectile weapons being fired from the other side. Meanwhile, the Mughal cavalry on their swift mounts had made inroads into the Afghan ranks from the flanks as well as the rear and began targeting the elephants, either slashing at the legs of the great beasts or taking out their riders. Hemu was forced to pull back his elephants and the Afghan attack relented.[14]\\r\\nSeeing the Afghan attack slackening, Ali Quli Khan led his cavalry out, circling around and falling upon the Afghan centre from the rear. Hemu, monitoring the battlefield from his howdah atop Hawai, immediately hurried to counter this charge. Even after seeing Shadi Khan Kakkar and another of his able lieutenants, Bhagwan Das, go down, he continued to lead counterattacks against the Mughals, running down any who challenged his elephants. It was a desperately contested battle but the advantage seemed to have tilted in favour of Hemu.[15] Both the wings of the Mughal army had been driven back and Hemu moved his contingent of war elephants and cavalry forward to crush their centre. It was at this point that Hemu, possibly on the cusp of victory, was wounded when he was struck in the eye by a chance Mughal arrow and collapsed unconscious. Seeing him going down triggered a panic in his army which broke formation and fled.[16][17] The battle was lost; 5000 dead lay on the field of battle and many more were killed while fleeing.[9]\\r\\nThe elephant carrying the wounded Hemu was captured and led to the Mughal camp. Bairam Khan asked the 13-year-old Akbar to behead Hemu, but he refused to take the sword to a dying man. Akbar was persuaded to touch Hemu's head with his sword after which Bairam Khan executed him.[17] Hemu's head was sent to Kabul while his body was gibbeted on a gate in Delhi.[16] A minaret was subsequently constructed of the heads of the other dead.[17]\\r\\nHemu's supporters would later erect a memorial for him at the spot in Panipat where he was beheaded. It is now known as Hemu's Samadhi Sthal.[18][19]\\r\\nWith the passing of Hemu, Adil Shah's fortunes also took a turn for the worse. He was defeated and killed by Khizr Khan, son of Muhammad Shah of Bengal, in April 1557.[17][20] The spoils from the battle at Panipat included 120 of Hemu's war elephants whose destructive rampages so impressed the Mughals that the animals soon became an integral part of their military strategies.[21]","input":"When was the second battle of panipat fought?"},{"output":"the nobility","context":"Feudalism was a combination of legal and military customs in medieval Europe that flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour. Although derived from the Latin word feodum or feudum (fief),[1] then in use, the term feudalism and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Middle Ages.[2] In its classic definition, by Fran?ois-Louis Ganshof (1944),[3] feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs.[3]\\r\\nA broader definition of feudalism, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but also those of all three estates of the realm: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasantry bound by manorialism; this is sometimes referred to as a \\"feudal society\\". Since the publication of Elizabeth A. R. Brown's \\"The Tyranny of a Construct\\" (1974) and Susan Reynolds's Fiefs and Vassals (1994), there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.[4][5][6][7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no commonly accepted modern definition of feudalism, at least among scholars.[4][7] The adjective feudal was coined in the 17th century, and the noun feudalism, often used in a political and propaganda context, was not coined until the 19th century,[4] from the French fodalit (feudality), itself an 18th-century creation.\\r\\nIn a classic definition by Fran?ois-Louis Ganshof (1944),[3] feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs,[3] though Ganshof himself noted that his treatment related only to the \\"narrow, technical, legal sense of the word\\".\\r\\nA broader definition, as described in Marc Bloch's Feudal Society (1939),[10] includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but those of all three estates of the realm: the nobility, the clergy, and those living by their labour, most directly the peasantry bound by manorialism; this order is often referred to as \\"feudal society\\", echoing Bloch's usage.\\r\\nSince the publication of Elizabeth A. R. Brown's \\"The Tyranny of a Construct\\" (1974)[5] and Susan Reynolds's Fiefs and Vassals (1994),[6] there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.[4][7][8]\\r\\nOutside a European context, the concept of feudalism is often used only by analogy (called semi-feudal), most often in discussions of feudal Japan under the shguns, and sometimes medieval and Gondarine Ethiopia.[11] However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing feudalism (or traces of it) in places as diverse as Spring and Autumn period in China, ancient Egypt, the Parthian empire, the Indian subcontinent and the Antebellum and Jim Crow American South.[11]\\r\\nThe term feudalism has also been appliedoften inappropriately or pejorativelyto non-Western societies where institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to prevail.[12] Some historians and political theorists believe that the term feudalism has been deprived of specific meaning by the many ways it has been used, leading them to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.[4][5]\\r\\nThe term \\"fodal\\" was used in 17th-century French legal treatises (1614)[13][14] and translated into English legal treatises as an adjective, such as \\"feodal government\\".\\r\\nIn the 18th century, Adam Smith, seeking to describe economic systems, effectively coined the forms \\"feudal government\\" and \\"feudal system\\" in his book Wealth of Nations (1776).[15] In the 19th century the adjective \\"feudal\\" evolved into a noun: \\"feudalism\\".[15] The term feudalism is recent, first appearing in French in 1823, Italian in 1827, English in 1839, and in German in the second half of the 19th century.[15]\\r\\nThe term \\"feudal\\" or \\"feodal\\" is derived from the medieval Latin word feodum. The etymology of feodum is complex with multiple theories, some suggesting a Germanic origin (the most widely held view) and others suggesting an Arabic origin. Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a beneficium (Latin).[16] Later, the term feudum, or feodum, began to replace beneficium in the documents.[16] The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one-hundred years earlier.[16] The origin of the feudum and why it replaced beneficium has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.[16]\\r\\nThe most widely held theory was proposed by Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern in 1870,[17][18] being supported by, amongst others, William Stubbs[16][19] and Marc Bloch.[16][20][21] Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term *fehu-?d, in which *fehu means \\"cattle\\" and -?d means \\"goods\\", implying \\"a moveable object of value.\\"[20][21] Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with moveable objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as feos, a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word feos meaning movable property changed little by little to feus meaning the exact opposite: landed property.[20][21]\\r\\nAnother theory was put forward by Archibald R. Lewis.[16] Lewis said the origin of 'fief' is not feudum (or feodum), but rather foderum, the earliest attested use being in Astronomus's Vita Hludovici (840).[22] In that text is a passage about Louis the Pious that says annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant, which can be translated as \\"Louis forbade that military provender (which they popularly call \\"fodder\\") be furnished..\\"[16]\\r\\nAnother theory by Alauddin Samarrai suggests an Arabic origin, from fuy (the plural of fay, which literally means \\"the returned\\", and was used especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight').[16][23] Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include feo, feu, feuz, feuum and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a loanword. The first use of these terms is in Languedoc, one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Muslim Spain. Further, the earliest use of feuum (as a replacement for beneficium) can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at Fraxinetum (La Garde-Freinet) in Provence was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to transliterate the Arabic word fuy (the plural of fay), which was being used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms ÿ feo, feu, feuz, feuum and others ÿ from which eventually feudum derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically \\"fanciful roots\\" in order to claim the most outlandish things to be of Arabian or Muslim origin.[23]\\r\\nFeudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the decentralization of an empire: especially in the Carolingian empires, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure[clarification needed] necessary to support cavalry without the ability to allocate land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.[24]\\r\\nThese acquired powers significantly diminished unitary power in these empires. Only when the infrastructure existed to maintain unitary poweras with the European monarchiesdid feudalism begin to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappear.[24]\\r\\nThe classic Fran?ois-Louis Ganshof version of feudalism[4][3] describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.[3]\\r\\nBefore a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a commendation ceremony, which was composed of the two-part act of homage and oath of fealty. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. Fealty comes from the Latin fidelitas and denotes the fidelity owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. \\"Fealty\\" also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage. Such an oath follows homage.[25]\\r\\nOnce the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was to \\"aid\\", or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal was responsible to answer calls to military service on behalf of the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed court baron, or at the king's court.[26]\\r\\nIt could also involve the vassal providing \\"counsel\\", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the manor this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied; see examples of feudalism.\\r\\nIn its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of \\"politics of land\\" (an expression used by the historian Marc Bloch). The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a \\"feudal revolution\\" or \\"mutation\\" and a \\"fragmentation of powers\\" (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or Germany in the same period or later:[27] Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as castellans and lesser seigneurs took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, most importantly the highly profitable rights of justice, but also travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations to use the lord's mill, etc.[28] (what Georges Duby called collectively the \\"seigneurie banale\\"[28]). Power in this period became more personal.[29]\\r\\nThis \\"fragmentation of powers\\" was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later.[30] Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords. In response to this, the idea of a \\"liege lord\\" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.[31]\\r\\nFeudalism itself decayed and effectively disappeared in most of Western Europe by about 1500,[32][33] partly since the military power of kings shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters (effectively reducing the nobility's power), but also because the Black Death reduced the nobility's hold on the lower classes. The system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. Russia finally abolished serfdom in 1861.[34][35]\\r\\nHowever, even when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian Georges Lefebvre explains how at an early stage of the French Revolution, on just one night of August 4, 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, \\"The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.\\" Lefebvre explains:\\r\\nWithout debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude  which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office, conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices.... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.[36]\\r\\nOriginally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a fourth of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners.[37] The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.[38]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"feudal society\\" as defined by Marc Bloch[10] offers a wider definition than Ganshof's and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the peasantry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the \\"powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes\\" came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classical feudal hierarchy.\\r\\nThe idea of feudalism was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Medieval Period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.\\r\\nThe concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as Montesquieu's De L'Esprit des Lois (1748; published in English as The Spirit of the Laws), and Henri de Boulainvillierss Histoire des anciens Parlements de France (1737; published in English as An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom, 1739).[15] In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the Ancien Rgime, or French monarchy. This was the Age of Enlightenment when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the \\"Dark Ages\\". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the \\"Dark Ages\\" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain.[39] For them \\"feudalism\\" meant seigneurial privileges and prerogatives. When the French Constituent Assembly abolished the \\"feudal regime\\" in August 1789 this is what was meant.\\r\\nAdam Smith used the term \\"feudal system\\" to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by serfs to landowning nobles.[40]\\r\\nKarl Marx also used the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society's economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal mode of production) as the order coming before capitalism. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the aristocracy) in their control of arable land, leading to a class society based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under serfdom and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents.[41] Marx thus defined feudalism primarily by its economic characteristics.\\r\\nHe also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny  under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs.[42] Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. Eric Wolf) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with Imperial Chinese and pre-Columbian Incan societies as 'tributary'.\\r\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, John Horace Round and Frederic William Maitland, both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions as to the character of English society before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while William the Conqueror introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (Holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).\\r\\nIn the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian Marc Bloch, arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian.,[41] approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in Feudal Society (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection ÿ both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centered on \\"lordship\\", and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.[41]\\r\\nIn contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian Fran?ois-Louis Ganshof defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in Qu'est-ce que la fodalit? (\\"What is feudalism?\\", 1944; translated in English as Feudalism). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars,[41] though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.\\r\\nAlthough he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre that came to be known as the Annales School, Georges Duby was an exponent of the Annaliste tradition. In a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled La socit aux XIe et XIIe sicles dans la rgion maconnaise (Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the Maconnais region), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian monastery of Cluny, as well as the dioceses of Macon and Dijon, Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the Maconnais region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutionsparticularly comital courts established under the Carolingian monarchythat had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.\\r\\nIn 1974, U.S. historian Elizabeth A. R. Brown[5] rejected the label feudalism as an anachronism that imparts a false sense of uniformity to the concept. Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of feudalism, she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back \\"tyrannically\\" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely.[41] In Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted (1994),[6] Susan Reynolds expanded upon Brown's original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds's methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument.[41] Reynolds argues:\\r\\nThe term feudal has also been applied to non-Western societies in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (See Examples of feudalism). Japan has been extensively studied in this regard.[44] Friday notes that in the 21st century historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.[45] Ultimately, critics say, the many ways the term feudalism has been used have deprived it of specific meaning, leading some historians and political theorists to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.[41]\\r\\nRichard Abels notes that \\"Western Civilization and World Civilization textbooks now shy away from the term 'feudalism'.\\"[46]\\r\\nMilitary:\\r\\nNon-European:","input":"What were the social classes in feudal europe?"},{"output":"the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress","context":"The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or sometimes U.S. EPA) is an agency of the federal government of the United States which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress.[2] President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA and it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the President and approved by Congress. The current Administrator is Scott Pruitt. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the Administrator is normally given cabinet rank.\\r\\nThe EPA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., regional offices for each of the agency's ten regions, and 27 laboratories. The agency conducts environmental assessment, research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and the federally recognized tribes. EPA enforcement powers include fines, sanctions, and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.\\r\\nIn 2016, the agency had 15,376 full-time employees.[1] More than half of EPA's employees are engineers, scientists, and environmental protection specialists; other employees include legal, public affairs, financial, and information technologists. In 2017 the Trump administration proposed a 31% cut to the EPA's budget to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs.[3]\\r\\nBeginning in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment.[4][5] Senator James E. Murray introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959, in the 86th Congress. The 1962 publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson alerted the public about the detrimental effects on the environment of the indiscriminate use of pesticides.[6] In the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint HouseÿSenate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator Henry M. Jackson, and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative George Miller, to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, some members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.[7]\\r\\nThe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)[8] was modeled on RCA.[9] That bill would have established a Council on Environmental Quality in the office of the President, declared a national environmental policy, and required the preparation of an annual environmental report.[10][better?source?needed] President Nixon signed NEPA into law on January 1, 1970. The law created the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in the Executive Office of the President.[11] NEPA required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. The \\"detailed statement\\" would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement (EIS).\\r\\nOn July 9, 1970, Nixon proposed an executive reorganization that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency.[12] After conducting hearings during that summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. The agencys first Administrator, William Ruckelshaus, took the oath of office on December 4, 1970.[5]\\r\\nEPA staff recall that in the early days there was \\"an enormous sense of purpose and excitement\\" and the expectation that there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country, leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up Americas environment.[13]\\r\\nWhen EPA first began operation, members of the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad. Ruckelshaus stated that he felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about governments effectiveness, that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution.[14]\\r\\nThe EPA is led by an Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. As of 2017[update] Scott Pruitt is the 14th Administrator.[15]\\r\\nCreating 10 EPA regions was an initiative that came from President Richard Nixon.[33] See Standard Federal Regions.\\r\\nEach EPA regional office is responsible within its states for implementing the Agency's programs, except those programs that have been specifically delegated to states.\\r\\nEach regional office also implements programs on Indian Tribal lands, except those programs delegated to tribal authorities.\\r\\nThe laws below are general environmental protection measures, and may also apply to other units of the government, including the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.\\r\\nIt is worth noting that, in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning, Administrator William Ruckelshaus observed that a danger for EPA was that air, water, waste and other programs would be unconnected, placed in silos, a problem that persists more than 50 years later, albeit less so than at the start.[35]\\r\\nThe EPA Safer Choice label, previously known as the Design for the Environment (DfE) label, helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients, without sacrificing quality or performance. When a product has the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists. Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label.\\r\\nThrough the Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative (SDSI),[36] EPA's Design for the Environment (DfE) recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants. Safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water. Nonylphenol ethoxylates, commonly referred to as NPEs, are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant.\\r\\nThe Design for the Environment, which was renamed to EPA Safer Choice in 2015, has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates. These safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available. CleanGredients[37] is a source of safer surfactants.\\r\\nIn 1992 the EPA launched the Energy Star program, a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency. As of 2006, more than 40,000 Energy Star products were available including major appliances, office equipment, lighting, home electronics, and more. In addition, the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings. In 2006, about 12 percent of new housing in the United States was labeled Energy Star.[38]\\r\\nThe EPA estimates it saved about $14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone. The Energy Star program has helped spread the use of LED traffic lights, efficient fluorescent lighting, power management systems for office equipment, and low standby energy use.[39]\\r\\nEPA's Smart Growth Program, which began in 1998, is to help communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want. Together with local, state, and national experts, EPA encourages development strategies that protect human health and the environment, create economic opportunities, and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels.[40]\\r\\nEPA administers the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (which is much older than the agency) and registers all pesticides legally sold in the United States.\\r\\nManufacturers selling automobiles in the United States are required to provide EPA fuel economy test results for their vehicles and the manufacturers are not allowed to provide results from alternate sources.[citation needed] The fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicle's Clean Air Act certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in Los Angeles during that era. Until 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test.[citation needed] In 1984, the EPA began adjusting city (aka Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule or UDDS) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972, and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, the EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures[41] to add a new higher-speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner-on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports. In December 2006 the updated testing methodology was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures.[42]\\r\\nIn February 2005, EPA launched a program called \\"Your MPG\\" that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the EPA's fuel economy website and compare them with others and with the original EPA test results.[43]\\r\\nThe EPA conducts fuel economy tests on very few vehicles. \\"Just 18 of the EPA's 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in Ann Arbor, Michigan, examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year, or roughly 15 percent of new models. As to that other 85 percent, the EPA takes automakers at their wordwithout any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate.\\"[44] Two-thirds of the vehicles the EPA tests themselves are randomly selected and the remaining third is tested for specific reasons.\\r\\nAlthough originally created as a reference point for fossil-fueled vehicles, driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will get on a single charge.[45]\\r\\nThe Air Quality Modeling Group (AQMG) is in the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) and leads in the full range of air quality models, atmospheric dispersion modeling and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing the impacts of air pollution sources and control strategies. It serves other EPA headquarters staff, EPA regional Offices, and State and local environmental agencies, coordinates with the EPA's Office of Research and Development on the development of new models and techniques, and wider issues of atmospheric research and conducts modeling analyses to support policy and regulatory decisions of the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS). It is located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Controlling air pollution helps diminish the risk of pollution-related diseases.\\r\\nThe EPA began regulating greenhouse gases (GHGs) from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the first time on January 2, 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to Section 202 of the CAA, and GHGs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of Part C of Title I of the Act per Regulation of Greenhouse Gases Under the Clean Air Act. The BenMAP open-source tool, created by the agency, estimates the health benefits from improvements in air quality.\\r\\nEPAs oil spill prevention program includes the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and the Facility Response Plan (FRP) rules. The SPCC Rule applies to all facilities that store, handle, process, gather, transfer, refine, distribute, use or consume oil or oil products. Oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as: animal fats, oils and greases; fish and marine mammal oils; and vegetable oils. It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground, and which might discharge to navigable waters (as defined in the Clean Water Act) or adjoining shorelines. Secondary spill containment is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites.[46]\\r\\nThe Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a resource for learning about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities. TRI data support informed decision-making by communities, government agencies, companies, and others.[47]\\r\\nWaterSense is an EPA program launched in June 2006 to encourage water efficiency in the United States through the use of a special label on consumer products.[48] Products include high-efficiency toilets (HETs), bathroom sink faucets (and accessories), and irrigation equipment. WaterSense is a voluntary program, with EPA developing specifications for water-efficient products through a public process and product testing by independent laboratories.[49]\\r\\nEPA ensures safe drinking water for the public, by setting standards for more than 160,000 public water systems nationwide. EPA oversees states, local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The program includes regulation of injection wells in order to protect underground sources of drinking water. Select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water, precipitation, and surface water, in addition to milk and air, are reported on EPA's Rad Net web site[50] in a section entitled Envirofacts.[51] Despite mandatory reporting certain readings exceeding EPA MCL levels may be deleted or not included.[52][53] In 2013, an EPA draft revision relaxed regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water, stating that current standards are impractical to enforce. The EPA recommended that intervention was not necessary until drinking water was contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter (the limit for short term exposure set by the International Atomic Energy Agency), which was 27,000 times the prior EPA limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure.[54]\\r\\nThe National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources which discharge to US waters. Created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program authorizes state governments to perform its many permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects.[55] As of 2017, EPA has approved 46 states to administer all or portions of the permit program.[56] EPA regional offices manage the program in the remaining areas of the country.[55] The Water Quality Act of 1987 extended NPDES permit coverage to industrial stormwater dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems.[57]\\r\\nEPA has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation.[58]\\r\\nEPA's Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools Program helps schools to maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants. It helps school personnel identify, solve, and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment. Through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building, schools can lower their students' and staff's risk of exposure to asthma triggers.[66]\\r\\nThe National Environmental Education Act of 1990 requires EPA to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy. EPA established the Office of Environmental Education to implement this program.[67]\\r\\nEPA is responsible for reviewing Environmental Impact Statements of other federal agencies' projects, under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).\\r\\nClean School Bus USA is a national partnership to reduce children's exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling, installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones. Its goal is to reduce both children's exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses.[68]\\r\\nThe EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress towards environmental justice. Administrator Christine Todd Whitman was criticized for her changes to President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12898 during 2001, removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation, and therefore defeating the spirit of the Executive Order.[69] In a March 2004 report, the inspector general of the agency concluded that the EPA \\"has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements\\" for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies and activities towards environmental justice.[70] Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA's Superfund program, and that this situation was worsening.[69]\\r\\nMany environmental justice issues are local, and therefore difficult to address by a federal agency, such as the EPA. Without strong media attention, political interest, or 'crisis' status, local issues are less likely to be addressed at the federal level compared to larger, well publicized incidents.\\r\\nConflicting political powers in successive administrations: The White House maintains direct control over the EPA, and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power. Republicans and Democrats differ in their approaches to environmental justice. While President Bill Clinton signed the executive order 12898, the Bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices, affecting the motivation for environmental enforcement.[71][page?needed]\\r\\nThe EPA is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes, informing the public of environmental enforcement, and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution, water pollution, hazardous wastes and chemicals. \\"It is difficult to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities.\\"[72][page?needed] It is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to. The EPA answers to various groups, competes for resources, and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment. All of these present challenges, including a lack of resources, its self-policing policy, and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for EPA officers.[73][page?needed]\\r\\nThe EPA \\"does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates\\" requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities.[74]\\r\\nIn March 2004, the U.S. Navy transferred USNS Bold (T-AGOS-12), a Stalwart class ocean surveillance ship, to the EPA. The ship had been used in anti-submarine operations during the Cold War, was equipped with sidescan sonar, underwater video, water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline. One of the major missions of the Bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials were dumped from dredging operations in U.S. ports.[75] In 2013, the General Services Administration sold the Bold to Seattle Central Community College (SCCC), which demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose, at a nominal cost of $5,000.[76]\\r\\nAdvance identification, or ADID, is a planning process used by the EPA to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material. The EPA conducts the process in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and local states or Native American Tribes. As of February 1993, 38 ADID projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing.[77]\\r\\nIn the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests, published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the EPA earned a D by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade.[78]\\r\\nIn 1982 Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps Superfund and demanded records from EPA director Anne M. Gorsuch. She refused and became the first agency director in U.S. history to be cited for contempt of Congress. The EPA turned the documents over to Congress several months later, after the White House abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoenaed by Congress because they were covered by executive privilege. At that point, Gorsuch resigned her post, citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation.[79] Critics charged that the EPA was in a shambles at that time.[80]\\r\\nGorsuch, appointed by Ronald Reagan, resigned under fire in 1983. Gorsuch based her administration of the EPA on the New Federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states.[81] She believed that the EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut the budget of the EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating.[82] Environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters, and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency.[83]\\r\\nIn April 2008, the Union of Concerned Scientists said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 EPA staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work. The survey included chemists, toxicologists, engineers, geologists and experts in other fields of science. About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life.[84]\\r\\nEPA research has also been suppressed by career managers.[85] Supervisors at EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about EPA's integrated risk information system, which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication, and the corresponding author, Ching-Hung Hsu, to leave EPA \\"because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing\\".[86] EPA subjects employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint, even if those papers are written on personal time.[87]\\r\\nEPA employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry[88][89][90] and governmental pressure, and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports.[88][91][92]\\r\\nIn 2015, the Government Accountability Office stated that the EPA violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms. The social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the Waters of the United States rule, including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule.[93]\\r\\nIn February 2017, U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) sponsored H.R. 861, a bill[94] to abolish the EPA by 2018. According to Gaetz, \\"The American people are drowning in rules and regulation promulgated by unelected bureaucrats. And the Environmental Protection Agency has become an extraordinary offender.\\" The bill was co-sponsored by Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Steven Palazzo (R-Ms.) and Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.).[95]\\r\\nIn July 2005, an EPA report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed. The report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it, but the EPA delayed its release at the last minute .[96]\\r\\nIn 2007, the state of California sued the EPA for its refusal to allow California and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars.[97] EPA administrator Stephen L. Johnson claimed that the EPA was working on its own standards, but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level, which would then preempt state laws.[98][99][100] California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with governors from 13 other states, stated that the EPA's actions ignored federal law, and that existing California standards (adopted by many states in addition to California) were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards.[101] It was reported that Stephen Johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision.[102]\\r\\nAfter the federal government had bailed out General Motors and Chrysler in the Automotive industry crisis of 2008ÿ2010, the 2010 Chevrolet Equinox was released with an EPA fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors. Independent road tests[103][104][105][106] found that the vehicle did not out-perform its competitors, which had much lower fuel economy ratings. Later road tests found better, but inconclusive, results.[107][108]\\r\\nIn March 2005, nine states (California, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Mexico and Vermont) sued the EPA. The EPA's Inspector General had determined that the EPA's regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act, and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees.[109][110] The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by Harvard University which contradicted its position on mercury controls.[111] The suit alleged that the EPA's rule exempting coal-fired power plants from \\"maximum available control technology\\" was illegal, and additionally charged that the EPA's system of cap-and-trade to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions, which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined.[112] Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations. Illinois's proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90% by 2009.[113] In 2008by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suitthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA regulations violated the Clean Air Act.[114]\\r\\nIn response, EPA announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule, and did so on March 16, 2011.[115]\\r\\nIn December 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfarea decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations. Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aideswho had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate changeknew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.[116]\\r\\nA $3 million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by EPA management during both the Bush and Obama Administrations, and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps.[117]\\r\\nIn August 2015, the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill occurred when EPA contractors examined the level of pollutants such as lead and arsenic in a Colorado mine,[118] and accidentally released over three million gallons of waste water into Cement Creek and the Animas River.[119]","input":"When was the environmental protection agency formed and what is its purpose?"},{"output":"Oceania","context":"","input":"Is papua new guinea in asia or oceania?"},{"output":"-1987","context":"IKEA (/a??ki??/, Swedish:?[?2ke?a]) is a Swedish-founded Dutch-based multinational group, that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances and home accessories. It has been the world's largest furniture retailer since at least 2008.[7][8][9][10][11] It was founded in Sweden in 1943 by then-17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad, who was listed by Forbes in 2015 as one of the ten richest people in the world, worth more than 40 billion dollars.[12][13][14] The company's name is an acronym that consists of the initials of Ingvar Kamprad (name of founder), Elmtaryd (the farm where he grew up), and Agunnaryd (his hometown in Sm?land, southern Sweden).[15]\\r\\nThe company is known for its modernist designs for various types of appliances and furniture, and its interior design work is often associated with an eco-friendly simplicity.[16] In addition, the firm is known for its attention to cost control, operational details, and continuous product development, corporate attributes that allowed IKEA to lower its prices by an average of two to three percent over the decade to 2010 during a period of global expansion. The IKEA group has a complex corporate structure, which the European Union has alleged was designed to avoid over 1 billion Euros in tax payments over the 2009-2014 period.[17][18] It is controlled by several foundations based in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.[19]\\r\\nAs of November 2017, IKEA owns and operates 411 stores in 49 countries.[20] In fiscal year 2016, ?36.4 billion worth of goods were sold, a total that represented a 7.6 percent increase over 2015.[21] The IKEA website contains about 12,000 products and is the closest representation of the entire IKEA range. There were over 2.1 billion visitors to IKEA's websites in the year from September 2015 to August 2016.[21] The company is responsible for approximately 1% of world commercial-product wood consumption, making it one of the largest users of wood in the retail sector.[22]\\r\\nMost of IKEA's stores and factories are owned by INGKA, a holding company that in turn is controlled by the Stichting INGKA Foundation, one of the 40 wealthiest foundations in the world.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIngvar Kamprad founded IKEA in 1943 as a mostly mail-order sales business. It began to sell furniture five years later.[24] The first M?bel-IKA store was opened in ?lmhult, Sm?land, in 1958 (M?bel means \\"furniture\\" in Swedish). The first stores outside Sweden were opened in Norway (1963) and Denmark (1969). The stores spread to other parts of Europe in the 1970s, with the first store outside Scandinavia opening in Switzerland (1973), followed by West Germany (1974).[25]\\r\\nAmid a high level of success, the company's West German executives accidentally opened a store in Konstanz in 1973 instead of Koblenz.[24] Later that decade, stores opened in other parts of the world, such as Japan (1974), Australia, Canada,[26][27] Hong Kong (1975), and Singapore (1978).[28] IKEA further expanded in the 1980s, opening stores in countries such as France and Spain (1981), Belgium (1984),[29] the United States (1985),[30] the United Kingdom (1987),[31] and Italy (1989).[32] The company later expanded into more countries in the 1990s and 2000s. Germany, with 53 stores, is IKEA's biggest market, followed by the United States, with 48 stores. At the end of the 2009 financial year, the IKEA group operated 267 stores in 25 countries.[33][needs update] The first IKEA store in Latin America opened on 17 February 2010 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.[34][35] As of July 2013, the company's presence in developing countries remains minimal.\\r\\nIn December 2014, it was announced that the world's largest IKEA store at 59,000?m2 (635,070.7?sq?ft),[37][38][39][40][36][41][42][43] opened near the KTX Gwangmyeong Station, located at the heart of South Korea's Seoul Capital Area. It opened the world's fourth largest store (and the largest standalone store in the world[44]) in Goyang, Gyeonggi on October 2017 at 52,199 square meters.[45] IKEA plans to open two more stores of such scale in the Seoul Capital Area, along with a store in Daejeon and Busan by 2020.\\r\\nThe largest store in the Southern Hemisphere is located in Tempe, Sydney, Australia with an area of 39,000?m2 (420,000?sq?ft).[46] The biggest store in North America is located in Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Canada. The store was opened in 1986 in the Ville-St-Laurent area, and was completely renovated and expanded in 2012-2013. Built in 1986, the store's initial area was 22,062?m2 (237,470?sq?ft), while the renovated store now measures 43,636?m2 (469,690?sq?ft).\\r\\nIn March 2013, IKEA opened its first outlet in Qatar, after a delay of several months.[47][48] Like others in the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Doha outlet is operated by the Al-Futtaim Group.[49] In August 2013, the first store in the Baltic States was opened in the Vilnius region of Lithuania. Construction of the 285,243?sq?ft (26,000?m2) store commenced in 2011 and the store employs over 200 people.[50] It is the biggest furniture-selling mall in the Baltic states.[51]\\r\\nIn 2014, IKEA opened its first warehouse in Croatia, near Zagreb.[52] The warehouse opened its doors on 21 August 2014.[53] The shopping center in Zagreb with an area of 38,000?m2 (410,000?sq?ft) is one of the five biggest in Europe and among the 10 biggest IKEA stores in the world.[54][55][56][57]\\r\\nOn 26 March 2015,[58] a set of 19 storage buildings holding various film and TV props, owned by Western Studio Services, were demolished in favor of construction of the largest IKEA in the United States.[59] Located in Burbank, California, this store replaced Burbank's existing IKEA located less than a mile away from the new construction site, which was nearly double the size of the existing store (456,000 sq ft).[59] The existing store ceased operations on 4 February 2017,[60] and the grand opening of the new store took place on 8 February 2017.[61]\\r\\nIKEA began constructing its first store in India on 11 August 2016. The 400,000 sq ft store in Hyderabad is being built at a cost of ?7 billion (US$110?million),[62][63] and is scheduled to open in early 2018. The company began construction of its second Indian store at Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra on 18 May 2017 and it is scheduled to open in January 2019. IKEA plans to open 5 stores in the state of Maharashtra and also build a distribution centre in Pune.[64][65] Per Indian regulations, IKEA will have to locally source at least 30% of the products sold at its Indian stores. The company plans to open 25 stores across 8 cities in the country by 2025. It predicts that Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore will be the company's largest markets, while Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Surat and smaller cities will also receive IKEA stores.[66] On 1 November 2017 IKEA bought 10 acres of land in Gurugram to expand operations in Northern India.[67]\\r\\nOn 31 January 2017, IKEA announced that it will open a new store in Latvia. It will be the second store to open in the Baltic states. The store will be located near Riga and is planned to open in August 2018.[68][69]\\r\\nOn 10 August 2017, IKEA opened its first store in Serbia and 400th store overall. IKEA invested ?70 million, and plans to open a second store in Belgrade in the future.[20]\\r\\nOn 16 November 2017, IKEA opened its third store in Malaysia in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. It is the largest store in Southeast Asia, spanning 502,815 sq ft.[70]\\r\\nIKEA was awarded the Nordic Language Award of 2017 for introducing Scandinavian language and culture to the global audience.[71]\\r\\nKamprad died on 27 January 2018.\\r\\nOlder IKEA stores are usually blue buildings with yellow accents (also Sweden's national colours) and few windows. They are often designed in a one-way layout, leading customers counter clockwise along what IKEA calls \\"the long natural way\\" designed to encourage the customer to see the store in its entirety (as opposed to a traditional retail store, which allows a customer to go directly to the section where the desired goods and services are displayed). There are often shortcuts to other parts of the showroom. Newer IKEA stores, like the one in M?nchengladbach, Germany, make more use of glass, both for aesthetics and functionality. Skylights are also now common in the self-serve warehouses; natural lighting reduces energy costs, improves worker morale and gives a better impression of the products.\\r\\nThe sequence first involves going through the furniture showrooms making note of selected items. The customer then collects a shopping cart and proceeds to an open-shelf \\"Market Hall\\" warehouse for smaller items, then visits the self-service furniture warehouse to collect previously noted showroom products in flat pack form. Sometimes, they are directed to collect products from an external warehouse on the same site or at a site nearby after purchase. Finally, customers pay for their products at a cash register.\\r\\nToday, most stores follow the same layout of having the showroom upstairs with the marketplace and self-service warehouse downstairs. Some stores are single level, while others have separate warehouses to allow more stock to be kept on-site. Single-level stores are found predominantly in areas where the cost of land would be less than the cost of building a 2-level store, such as the Saarlouis, Germany and Haparanda, Sweden locations. Some stores have dual-level warehouses with machine-controlled silos to allow large quantities of stock to be accessed throughout the selling day.\\r\\nMost IKEA stores offer an \\"as-is\\" area at the end of the warehouse, just before the cash registers. Returned, damaged and formerly showcased products are displayed here and sold with a significant discount, but also with a no-returns policy. Most IKEA stores communicate the IKEA policy on environmental issues in this part of the store. The area, which is painted red, is named according to local customs, in the United Kingdom this is referred to as \\"Bargain Corner\\", in Sweden \\"FYND\\" (Bargains) and in Denmark, \\"Rodebutikken\\" (Rummage boutique).\\r\\nIKEA uses a sales technique called \\"bulla bulla\\" in which a bunch of items are purposefully jumbled in bins, to create the impression of volume, and therefore, inexpensiveness.[24][72]\\r\\nEvery store includes a restaurant serving traditional Swedish food, including potatoes with Swedish meatballs.[73][74] In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the usual boiled or mashed potatoes have been replaced with French fries. Besides these Swedish foods, hot dogs and drinks are also sold, along with a few varieties of the local cuisine, and beverages such as lingonberry juice. Also items such as prinsesst?rta (princess cake) are sold as desserts. Stores in Israel sell kosher food with a high degree of rabbinical supervision.[75] The kosher restaurants are separated into dairy and meat areas; falafel and non-dairy ice cream are available at the exit. IKEA stores in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates serve chicken shawarma at the exit caf as well as beef hot dogs, while in United Kingdom, a Quorn hot dog is available in the exit caf.[76] Coffee, soft drinks, and tea refills are free, as like in Sweden within store premises. All of the stores are equipped with Nordic fruit drinks since 2017, replacing Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\\r\\nIn many locations, the IKEA restaurants open daily before the rest of the store and serve an inexpensive breakfast.[77][78][79]\\r\\nEvery store also has a Swedish Food Market that, until 2011, sold branded Swedish prepared specialist foods, such as meatballs, packages of gravy, lingonberry jam, various biscuits and crackers, and salmon and fish roe spread. Later, IKEA replaced most of the branded foods and extended its product range with the introduction of the IKEA food label. The new label has a variety of items including chocolates, meatballs, jams, pancakes, salmon, along with various drinks. All food products are based on Swedish recipes and traditions.\\r\\nEvery store has a kids play area, named Sm?land (Swedish for small lands; it is also the Swedish province where Kamprad was born). Parents drop off their children at a gate to the playground, and pick them up after they arrive at another entrance. In some stores, parents are given free pagers by the on-site staff, which the staff can use to summon parents whose children need them earlier than expected; in others, staff summon parents through announcements over the in-store public address system or by calling them on their cellphones.[80]\\r\\nThe vast majority of IKEA stores are located outside of city centers, primarily because of land cost and traffic access. Several smaller store formats have been unsuccessfully tested in the past (the \\"midi\\" concept in the early '90s, which was tested in Ottawa and Heerlen with 9,300?m2 (100,000?sq?ft), or a \\"boutique\\" shop in Manhattan). A new format for a full-size, city centre store was introduced with the opening of the Manchester (United Kingdom) store, situated in Ashton-under-Lyne in 2006. Another store, in Coventry opened in December 2007. The store has seven floors and a different flow from other IKEA stores. IKEA's Southampton store which opened in February 2009 is also in the city centre and built in an urban style similar to the Coventry store. IKEA built these stores in response to UK government restrictions blocking retail establishment outside city centres.[81]\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, where shop space is limited and costly, IKEA has opened three outlets in the city, most of which have the one-way layout. They are part of shopping malls, and while being tiny compared to common store design, are huge by Hong Kong standards.\\r\\nIn 2015, IKEA announced that it would be attempting a smaller store design at several locations in Canada. This modified store will feature only a display gallery and small warehouse. One location planned for Kitchener is in the place formerly occupied by a Sears Home store. The warehouses will not keep furniture stocked, and so customers will not be able to drop in to purchase and leave with furniture the same day. Instead, they will purchase the furniture in advance online or in store and order the furniture delivered to one of the new stores, for a greatly reduced rate. IKEA claims that this new model will allow them to expand quickly into new markets rather than spending years opening a full-size store.[82]\\r\\nRather than being sold pre-assembled, much of IKEA's furniture is designed to be assembled by the customer. The company claims that this helps reduce costs and use of packaging by not shipping air; the volume of a bookcase, for example, is considerably less if it is shipped unassembled rather than assembled. This is also more practical for customers using public transport, because flat packs can be more easily carried.\\r\\nIKEA contends that it has been a pioneering force in sustainable approaches to mass consumer culture.[83] Kamprad calls this \\"democratic design,\\" meaning that the company applies an integrated approach to manufacturing and design (see also environmental design). In response to the explosion of human population and material expectations in the 20th and 21st centuries, the company implements economies of scale, capturing material streams and creating manufacturing processes that hold costs and resource use down, such as the extensive use of Medium-Density Fiberboard (\\"MDF\\"), also called \\"particle board.\\" It is an engineered wood fibre glued under heat and pressure to create a building material of superior strength which is resistant to warp. IKEA uses cabinet-grade and furniture-grade MDF in all of its MDF products, such as PAX wardrobes and kitchen cupboards. IKEA also uses wood, plastic, and other materials for furniture and other products. The intended result is flexible, adaptable home furnishings, scalable both to smaller homes and dwellings as well as large houses.\\r\\nNot all furniture is stocked at the store level, such as particular sofa colours needing to be shipped from a warehouse to the customer's home (for a delivery charge). The item can also be shipped from the warehouse to the store. Some stores charge an extra fee for this service, but not all.[clarification needed]\\r\\nNotable items of IKEA furniture include the Po?ng armchair, the Billy bookcase and the Klippan sofa, all of which have sold by the tens of millions since the late 1970s.[84][85]\\r\\nIKEA products are identified by one-word (rarely two-word) names. Most of the names are Scandinavian in origin. Although there are some exceptions, most product names are based on a special naming system developed by IKEA.[86] Company founder Kamprad was dyslexic and found that naming the furniture with proper names and words, rather than a product code, made the names easier to remember.[87]\\r\\nFor example, DUKTIG (meaning: clever, well-behaved) is a line of children's toys, OSLO is a name of a bed, BILLY (a Swedish masculine name) is a popular bookcase, DINERA (meaning: (to) dine) for tableware, KASSETT (meaning: cassette) for media storage. One range of office furniture is named EFFEKTIV (meaning: efficient, effective), SK?RPT (meaning: sharp or clever) is a line of kitchen knives.\\r\\nA notable exception is the IVAR shelving system, which dates back to the early 1970s. This item is named after the item's designer.\\r\\nSome of IKEA's Swedish product names have amusing or unfortunate connotations in other languages, sometimes resulting in the names being withdrawn in certain countries. Notable examples for English include the \\"Jerker\\" computer desk (discontinued several years ago as of 2013), \\"Fukta\\" plant spray, \\"Fartfull\\" workbench,[88] and \\"Lyckhem\\" (meaning bliss). Kitchen legs are called FAKTUM (called AKURUM in the United States). The latest addition is the new \\"Askholmen\\" outdoor suite. Similar blunders happen with other multinational companies.[89]\\r\\nIn 2016 IKEA started a move into the smart home business. The TR?DFRI smart lighting kit was one of the first ranges signalling this change.[90] IKEA's media team has confirmed that smart home project will be a big move. They have also started a partnership with Philips Hue.[91] The wireless charging furniture, integrating wireless Qi charging into everyday furniture, is another strategy for the smart home business.[92]\\r\\nA collaboration to build Sonos' smart speaker technology into furniture sold by IKEA was announced in December 2017.[93] The first products resulting from the collaboration will launched in 2019.[94]\\r\\nIKEA has also expanded its product base to include flat-pack houses and apartments, in an effort to cut prices involved in a first-time buyer's home. (This practice is not new; the defunct Canadian retailer Eaton's sold houses in a similar fashion), The IKEA product, named BoKlok was launched in Sweden in 1996 in a joint venture with Skanska. Now working in the Nordic countries and in the UK, sites confirmed in England include London, Ashton-under-Lyne, Leeds, Gateshead, Warrington and Liverpool.[95]\\r\\nAt the end of September 2013, the company announced that solar panel packages, so-called \\"residential kits\\", for houses will be sold at 17 UK stores by mid-2014. The decision followed a successful pilot project at the Lakeside IKEA store, whereby one photovoltaic system was sold almost every day. The solar CIGS panels are manufactured by Solibro, a German-based subsidiary of the Chinese company Hanergy.[96][97] By the end of 2014, IKEA began to sell Solibro's solar residential kits in the Netherlands and in Switzerland.[98]\\r\\nIn November 2015 IKEA ended its contract with Hanergy and in April 2016 started working with Solarcentury[99]\\r\\nIKEA announced in April 2016, that it was doing a second attempt with SolarCity to sell solar panels in the United Kingdom. It allows users to be able to order them online and starting with three stores and by the end of summer available in all United Kingdom stores.[100]\\r\\nIKEA owns and operates the MEGA Family Shopping Centre chain in Russia.\\r\\nOn 8 August 2008, IKEA UK launched a virtual mobile phone network called IKEA Family Mobile, which ran on T-Mobile.[101] At launch it was the cheapest pay-as-you-go network in the UK.[102][103] In June 2015 the network announced that its services would cease to operate from 31 August 2015.[104][105]\\r\\nAs of 2012, IKEA is in joint venture with TCL to provide Uppleva integrated HDTV and entertainment system product.[106][107]\\r\\nIn mid-August 2012, the company announced that it will establish a chain of 100 economy hotels in Europe but, unlike its few existing hotels in Scandinavia, they will not carry the IKEA name, nor will they use IKEA furniture and furnishings?ÿ they will be operated by an unnamed international group of hoteliers.[108]\\r\\nIn September 2017, IKEA announced they would be acquiring San Francisco-based TaskRabbit. The deal should be completed by the end of October 2017 and TaskRabbit will remain an independent company.[109]\\r\\nIKEA is owned and operated by a complicated array of not-for-profit and for-profit corporations. The corporate structure is divided into two main parts: operations and franchising.\\r\\nThe ownership of Inter IKEA Systems is exceedingly complicated and not publicly known. Inter IKEA Systems is owned by Inter IKEA Holding, a company registered in Luxembourg. The Inter IKEA Holding, in turn, is owned by the Interogo Foundation, based in Liechtenstein.[110][111] In 2016, the INGKA Holding sold its design, manufacturing and logistics subsidiaries to the Inter IKEA Holding.[112]\\r\\nIn June 2013, Ingvar Kamprad resigned from the board of Inter IKEA Holding SA and his youngest son Mathias Kamprad replaced Per Ludvigsson as the chairman of the holding company. Following his decision to step down, the 87-year-old founder explained, \\"I see this as a good time for me to leave the board of Inter IKEA Group. By that we are also taking another step in the generation shift that has been ongoing for some years.\\"[113] After the 2016 company restructure, Inter IKEA Holding SA no longer exists. Mathias Kamprad became board member of the Inter IKEA Group and the Interogo Foundation.[114] Mathias and his two older brothers, who also have leadership roles at IKEA, work on the corporation's overall vision and long-term strategy.[113]\\r\\nIn Australia, IKEA is operated by two companies. Stores located on the East Coast including Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria are owned by INGKA Holding. Stores elsewhere in the country including South Australia and Western Australia are owned by Cebas Pty Ltd.[115] Like elsewhere, all stores are operated under a franchise agreement with Inter IKEA Systems.[116]\\r\\nAlong with helping IKEA make non-taxable profit, IKEA's complicated corporate structure allowed Kamprad to maintain tight control over the operations of INGKA Holding, and thus the operation of most IKEA stores. The INGKA Foundation's five-person executive committee was chaired by Kamprad. It appoints board of INGKA Holding, approves any changes to INGKA Holding's bylaws, and has the right to preempt new share issues. If a member of the executive committee quits or dies, the other four members appoint his or her replacement.\\r\\nIn Kamprad's absence the foundation's bylaws include specific provisions requiring it to continue operating the INGKA Holding group and specifying that shares can be sold only to another foundation with the same objectives as the INGKA Foundation.[110]\\r\\nThe net profit of IKEA Group (which does not include Inter IKEA systems) in fiscal year 2009 (after paying franchise fees to Inter IKEA systems) was ?2.538 billion on sales of ?21.846 billion. Because INGKA Holding is owned by the nonprofit INGKA Foundation, none of this profit is taxed. The foundation's nonprofit status also means that the Kamprad family cannot reap these profits directly, but the Kamprads do collect a portion of IKEA sales profits through the franchising relationship between INGKA Holding and Inter IKEA Systems.\\r\\nInter IKEA Systems collected ?631 million of franchise fees in 2004, but reported pre-tax profits of only ?225 million in 2004. One of the major pre-tax expenses that Inter IKEA systems reported was ?590 million of \\"other operating charges\\". IKEA has refused to explain these charges, but Inter IKEA Systems appears to make large payments to I.I. Holding, another Luxembourg-registered group that, according to The Economist, \\"is almost certain to be controlled by the Kamprad family.\\" I.I. Holding made a profit of ?328 million in 2004.\\r\\nIn 2004, the Inter IKEA group of companies and I.I. Holding reported combined profits of ?553m and paid ?19m in taxes, or approximately 3.5 percent.[110] In 2013 the Daily Mail media publication reported that the IKEA subsidiary Swedwood had grown between 20-30% per year since its inception in 1991.[117]\\r\\nThe Berne Declaration, a non-profit organisation in Switzerland that promotes corporate responsibility, has formally criticised IKEA for its tax avoidance strategies. In 2007, the Berne Declaration nominated IKEA for one of its Public Eye \\"awards\\", which highlight corporate irresponsibility and are announced during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.[118]\\r\\nIn a company statement emailed on 14 October 2013, IKEA's full-year sales rose 3.1 percent due in part to growth in Russia and China. IKEA's revenue total rose to US$37.9 billion (27.9 billion euros), with significant growth also recorded in North America.[119]\\r\\nIn February 2016, the Greens / EFA group in the European Parliament issued a report entitled IKEA: Flat Pack Tax Avoidance on the tax planning strategies of IKEA and their possible use to avoid tax in several European countries. The report was sent to Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, and Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, expressing the hope that it would be of use to them in their respective roles \\"to advance the fight for tax justice in Europe.\\"[18] .[120] Sales jumped 17 per cent to almost ?132 million in the 12 months to the end of August 2015 [121]\\r\\nAlthough IKEA household products and furniture are designed in Sweden, they are largely manufactured in developing countries to keep costs down. For most of its products, the final assembly is performed by the end-user (consumer).\\r\\nSwedwood, an IKEA subsidiary, handles production of all of the company's wood-based products, with the largest Swedwood factory located in Southern Poland. According to the subsidiary, over 16,000 employees across 50 sites in 10 countries manufacture the 100 million pieces of furniture that IKEA sells annually. IKEA furniture uses the hardwood alternative particle board and Hultsfred, a factory in southern Sweden, is the company's sole supplier.[117]\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, IKEA kept its costs down by using production facilities in East Germany. A portion of the workforce at those factories consisted of political prisoners. This fact, revealed in a report by Ernst & Young commissioned by the company, resulted from intermingling of criminals and political dissidents in the state-owned production facilities IKEA contracted with, a practice which was generally known in West Germany. IKEA was one of a number of companies, including West German firms, which benefited from this practice. The investigation resulted from attempts by former political prisoners to obtain compensation. In November 2012, IKEA admitted being aware at the time of the possibility of use of forced labor and failing to exercise sufficient control to identify and avoid it. A summary of the Ernst & Young report was released on 16 November 2012.[122]\\r\\nIKEA was named one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers in 2004 and 2005 by Working Mothers magazine. It ranked 80 in Fortune's 200 Best Companies to Work For in 2006 and in October 2008, IKEA Canada LP was named one of \\"Canada's Top 100 Employers\\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. [123]\\r\\nIn 2012, IKEA in France was accused by the independent newspaper Le Canard encha?n and the investigative website Mediapart of spying on its employees and clients by illegally accessing French police records. The head of risk management at IKEA feared his employees were anti-globalists or potential ecoterrorists.[124][125]\\r\\nAfter initial environmental issues like the highly publicized formaldehyde scandals in the early 1980s and 1992,[126][127][128] IKEA took a proactive stance on environmental issues and tried to prevent future incidents through a variety of measures.[129] In 1990, IKEA invited Karl-Henrik Robrt, founder of the Natural Step, to address its board of directors. Robert's system conditions for sustainability provided a strategic approach to improving the company's environmental performance. In 1990, IKEA adopted the Natural Step framework as the basis for its environmental plan.[130] This led to the development of an Environmental Action Plan, which was adopted in 1992. The plan focused on structural change, allowing IKEA to \\"maximize the impact of resources invested and reduce the energy necessary to address isolated issues.\\"[130] The environmental measures taken include the following:\\r\\nIn 2000 IKEA introduced its code of conduct for suppliers, called the IKEA way of purchasing, shortened as IWAY. Today IWAY is a totally integrated part of IKEA's purchasing model. IWAY covers social, safety and environmental questions. Today IKEA has around 60 IWAY auditors who perform hundreds of supplier audits every year. The main purpose with IWAY is to make sure that the IKEA suppliers follow the law in each country where they are based. Most IKEA suppliers fulfill the law today with exceptions for some special issues, one being excessive working hours in Asia, in countries such as China and India.[citation needed]\\r\\nMore recently,[when?] IKEA has stopped providing plastic bags to customers, but offers reusable bags for sale. The IKEA restaurants also only offer reusable plates, knives, forks, spoons, etc. Toilets in some IKEA WC-rooms have been outfitted with dual-function flushers. IKEA has recycling bins for compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), energy saving bulbs and batteries. In 2001 IKEA was one of the first companies to operate its own cross-border goods trains through several countries in Europe.[132]\\r\\nIn August 2008, IKEA also announced that it had created IKEA GreenTech, a ?50 million venture capital fund. Located in Lund (a university town in Sweden), it will invest in 8ÿ10 companies in the coming five years with focus on solar panels, alternative light sources, product materials, energy efficiency and water saving and purification. The aim is to commercialise green technologies for sale in IKEA stores within 3ÿ4 years.[133][134]\\r\\nTo make IKEA a more sustainable company, a product life cycle was created. For the idea stage, products should be flat-packed so that more items can be shipped at once; products should also be easier to dismantle and recycle. Raw materials are used, and since wood and cotton are two of IKEA's most important manufacturing products, the company works with environmentally friendly forests and cotton, whereby the excessive use of chemicals and water is avoided.[135]\\r\\nManufacturing is third in the life cycle and includes IWAY, IKEA's code of conduct for manufacturers and suppliers that formulates and enforces requirements for working conditions, social and environmental standards, and what suppliers can expect from IKEA in return. Marketing is another part of IKEA's life cycle and a portion of the paper used for its catalogues is sourced from responsibly managed forests. The catalogue is also smaller, so that less paper is required, less waste is produced and more catalogues can be shipped per load.[citation needed]\\r\\nIKEA stores recycle waste and many run on renewable energy with the use of energy-saving bulbs and sensors. All employees are trained in environmental and social responsibility, while public transit is one of the priorities when the location of stores is considered. Also, the coffee and chocolate served at IKEA stores is UTZ Certified.[136]\\r\\nThe last stage of the life cycle is the end of life. Most IKEA stores recycle light bulbs and drained batteries, and the company is also exploring the recycling of sofas and other home furnishing products. According to IKEA's 2012 \\"Sustainability Report\\", 23% of all wood that the company uses meets the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council, and the report states that IKEA aims to double this percentage by 2017. The report also states that IKEA does not accept illegally logged wood and supports 13 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) projects.[117]\\r\\nOn 17 February 2011, IKEA announced its plans to develop a wind farm in Dalarna County, Sweden, furthering its goal of using only renewable energy to fuel its operations.[137] As of June 2012,[needs update] 17 United States IKEA stores are powered by solar panels, with 22 additional installations in progress,[138] and IKEA owns the 165 MW Cameron Wind farm in Cameron County on the South Texas coast[139] and a 42 MW coastal wind farm in Finland.[140]\\r\\nIn 2011, the company examined its wood consumption and noticed that almost half of its global pine and spruce consumption was for the fabrication of pallets. The company consequently started a transition to the use of paper pallets and the \\"Optiledge system\\".[141] The OptiLedge product is totally recyclable, made from 100% virgin high-impact copolymer polypropylene (PP). The system is a \\"unit load alternative to the use of a pallet. The system consists of the OptiLedge (usually used in pairs), aligned and strapped to the bottom carton to form a base layer upon which to stack more product. Corner boards are used when strapping to minimize the potential for package compression.\\" The conversion began in Germany and Japan, before its introduction into the rest of Europe and North America.[142] The system has been marketed to other companies, and IKEA has formed the OptiLedge company to manage and sell the product.[143]\\r\\nIKEA has expanded its sustainability plan in the UK to include electric car charge points for customers at all locations by the end of 2013.[144] The effort will include Nissan and Ecotricity and promise to deliver an 80% charge in 30 minutes.[145]\\r\\nIn February 2014, IKEA in the UK announced that from 2016 they will only sell energy-efficient LED lightbulbs, lamps and light fixtures. LED lightbulbs use as much as only 15% of the power of a regular incandescent light bulb.[146] IKEA hope to have a 100% clean energy supply in all their firms come the year 2020.[147]\\r\\nThe INGKA Foundation is officially dedicated to promoting \\"innovations in architecture and interior design.\\"[110] The net worth of the foundation exceeded the net worth of the much better known Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (now the largest private foundation in the world) for a period.[148] However, most of the Group's profit is spent on investment; the foundation expects to spend ?45 million on charitable giving in 2010 (compare the Gates Foundation, which made gifts of more than $1.5 billion in 2005.[148])\\r\\nIKEA is involved in several international charitable causes, particularly in partnership with UNICEF, including:\\r\\nIKEA also supports American Forests to restore forests and reduce pollution.[151][152]\\r\\nIn September 2005, IKEA Social Initiative was formed to manage the company's social involvements on a global level. IKEA Social Initiative is headed by Marianne Barner.\\r\\nThe main partners of IKEA Social Initiative are UNICEF[153] and Save the Children.[154]\\r\\nOn 23 February 2009, at the ECOSOC event in New York, UNICEF announced that IKEA Social Initiative has become the agency's largest corporate partner, with total commitments of more than US$180 million.[155][156]\\r\\nExamples of involvements:\\r\\nIn 2009, Sweden's largest television station, SVT, revealed that IKEA's moneythe three per cent collection from each storedoes not actually go to a charitable foundation in the Netherlands, as IKEA has said. Inter IKEA is owned by a foundation in Liechtenstein, called Interogo, which has amassed $12 billion, and is controlled by the Kamprad family.[24]\\r\\nIKEA publishes an annual catalogue, first published in Swedish in 1951.[162] IKEA published 197 million catalogues in 2010, in twenty languages and sixty-one editions.[24] It is considered to be the main marketing tool of the retail giant, consuming 70% of the company's annual marketing budget.[163]\\r\\nThe catalogue is distributed both in stores and by mail,[164] with most of it being produced by IKEA Communications AB in IKEA's hometown of ?lmhult, Sweden where IKEA operates the largest photo studio in northern Europe at 8,000 square metres (86,000?sq?ft).[165] The catalogue itself is printed on chlorine-free paper of 10ÿ15% post-consumer waste, and prints approximately 175 million copies worldwide annually,[166] more than 3 times as much as the Bible.[167]\\r\\nThe 2013 catalogue is smartphone compatible, containing videos and photo galleries that can be accessed via an app by scanning the catalogue's pages, while the 2014 catalog incorporates an augmented reality app that projects an item into a real-time photograph image of the user's room. The augmented reality app also provides an indication of the scale of IKEA objects in relation to the user's living environment.[168]\\r\\nIn 1994, IKEA ran a commercial in the United States widely thought to be the first to feature a homosexual couple; it aired for several weeks before being pulled after calls for a boycott and a bomb threat directed at IKEA stores.[169] Other IKEA commercials appeal to the wider GLBTQ community, one featuring a transgender woman.[170]\\r\\nIn 2002, the inaugural television component of the \\"Unb?ring\\" campaign, titled Lamp, went on to win several awards, including a Grand Clio,[171] Golds at the London International Awards[172] and the ANDY Awards,[173] and the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival,[174] the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising community.\\r\\nIKEA launched a UK-wide \\"Home is the Most Important Place in the World\\" advertising campaign in September 2007 using estate agent signs with the term \\"Not For Sale\\" written on them as part of the wider campaign. After the campaign appeared in the Metro newspaper London the business news website www.mad.co.uk remarked that the IKEA campaign had amazing similarities with the marketing activity of UK home refurbishment company Onis living who had launched its own Not For Sale advertising campaign two years prior and was awarded the Interbuild 2006 Construction Marketing Award for best campaign under S25,000.[175][176]\\r\\nA debate ensued between Fraser Patterson, Chief Executive of Onis and Andrew McGuinness, partner at Beattie McGuinness Bungay (BMB), the advertising and PR agency awarded the S12m IKEA account.[177][178] The essence of the debate was that BMB claimed to be unaware of Onis's campaign as Onis was not an advertising agency. Onis's argument was that its advertising could be seen in prominent landmarks throughout London, having been already accredited, showing concern about the impact IKEA's campaign would have on the originality of its own. BMB and IKEA subsequently agreed to provide Onis with a feature page on the IKEA campaign site linking through to Onis's website for a period of 1 year.\\r\\nIn 2008, IKEA paired up with the makers of video game The Sims 2 to make a stuff pack called IKEA Home Stuff, featuring many IKEA products. It was released on 24 June 2008 in North America and 26 June 2008 in Europe. It is the second stuff pack with a major brand, the first being The Sims 2 H&M Fashion Stuff.\\r\\nIKEA took over the title sponsorship of Philadelphia's annual Thanksgiving Day parade in 2008, replacing Boscov's, which filed for bankruptcy in August 2008.\\r\\nIn November 2008, a subway train decorated in IKEA style was introduced in Novosibirsk, Russia.[179] Four cars were turned into a mobile showroom of the Swedish design. The redesigned train, which features colourful seats and fancy curtains, carried passengers until 6 June 2009.\\r\\nOyster cards (the ticket-free system for the London Underground) were for given with wallets sponsored by IKEA in 2008-09. IKEA also sponsored the tube map.[180][181]\\r\\nIn January 2009, just before the new store opened in Southampton, MV?Red Osprey of Red Funnel was re-painted in an entirely yellow and blue livery to celebrate the opening of the new IKEA store in Southampton. This is the first time a Red Funnel ferry has been re-painted out of its own red and white colour scheme. It stayed in these colours for 12 months as part of a deal between Red Funnel and IKEA to provide home delivery services to the Isle of Wight. It was repainted with Red Funnel's red and white livery when the deal ended in January 2010.\\r\\nIn March 2010, IKEA developed an event in four important Metro stations in Paris, in which furniture collections are displayed in high-traffic spots, giving potential customers a chance to check out the brand's products. The Metro walls were also filled with prints that showcase IKEA interiors.\\r\\nIn September 2010, IKEA launched an advertisement for UK and Ireland called \\"Happy Inside\\" which had 100 cats lying on IKEA furniture in the flagship IKEA store in Wembley, London.[182]\\r\\nIn April 2011, an advertising campaign was launched aiming at discovering whether men or women are messier in the home. Created by Mother, the campaign will begin with a TV advert shot in front of a live audience, featuring four stand-up comedians, two men and two women, debating which gender is messier. The idea behind the campaign is that domestic clutter leads to arguments, and thus to an unhappy home, a conflict that IKEA wants to show can be avoided with better storage. Viewers will be directed to a new Facebook page for the brand, where they are able to vote on who they believe is messier, and submit evidence using videos and photos through an app created especially for the campaign. Meanwhile, online display banners will allow other users the opportunity to vote, with online adverts promoting IKEA products demonstrating the problems confronting people, and offering solutions.[183]\\r\\nIn 2016, in conjunction with Stokholm ad agency ?kestam Holst, IKEA released the \\"Where Life Happens\\" video campaign.[184] The series focused on taboo issues like divorce and adoption, and was filmed in a non-traditional 4:3 aspect ratio.[184][185] The campaign won an Epica gold award in Amsterdam.[186]\\r\\nIn common with some other retailers, IKEA launched a loyalty card called \\"IKEA Family\\". The card is free of charge and can be used to obtain discounts on certain products found in-store. It is available worldwide. In conjunction with the card, IKEA also publishes and sells a printed quarterly magazine titled IKEA Family Live which supplements the card and catalogue. The magazine is already printed in thirteen languages and an English edition for the United Kingdom was launched in February 2007. It is expected to have a subscription of over 500,000.[187]\\r\\nIn September 12, 2017, IKEA announced the augmented reality app, IKEA Place, following by Apple's release of its ARkit technology and iOS 11.[188] IKEA Place helps consumers to visualize true to scale IKEA products into real environment.[189]\\r\\nIKEA's goals of sustainability and environmental design in its merchandise have sometimes been at odds with the impact a new IKEA store can have on a community. In particular, the size of proposed IKEA stores has often seen significant opposition from members of such communities. The following are a list of issues which have received negative media attention, both regarding the size of IKEA's stores and other controversies:\\r\\nIKEA has been criticised by Citytv in Canada for charging up to twice as much in their Canadian stores as for the same items sold in their American stores, despite the Canadian dollar reaching parity with the U.S. dollar.[198]\\r\\nWithin the days after the launch of the South Korean edition of the official website, complaints arose from a group of consumers on IKEA's pricing policy in the country: the prices of certain products were higher than other countries.[199] On 24 November 2014, Jang Duck-jin, head of the Fair Trade Commission's consumer policy bureau, told the media that the Commission was planning to commission a consumer group to compare IKEA's product prices by country,[200] and on 19 March 2015, the Consumers Union of Korea published a report comparing the prices of 49 IKEA products in South Korea and other countries.[201]\\r\\nIn February 2013, IKEA announced it had pulled 17,000 portions of Swedish meatballs containing beef and pork from stores in Europe after testing in the Czech Republic found traces of horsemeat in the product. The company removed the Swedish meatballs from stores' shelves on 25 February 2013, but only made the announcement public after Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet uncovered what happened.[207] In a March 2013 media report, an IKEA representative stated that the corporation had forced Familjen Dafgard, its main meatball supplier, to cease business with eight of its 15 suppliers and would reduce the number of purchasing countries. The discovered horsemeat was traced to a Polish abattoir.[208]\\r\\nIn July 2015, IKEA, with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, through the company's Safer Homes Together advertising campaign, issued a warningnot a recallin the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland to customers to secure the Malm chests of drawers and wardrobes firmly to the wall using free kits distributed by the company, after two deaths of young children in the U.S. in February and June 2014 when the furniture pieces tipped over on them. There were three other deaths, from 1989, from other, similar appliance models tipping over, and 14 incidents of Malm chests tipping over, resulting in four injuries. The company sent out free kits on request for customers to anchor the furniture to the wall.[209] In June 2016, after a third toddler died in the U.S., IKEA recalled all Malm dressers as well as several similar models which posed a tipping danger if not secured to the wall with the supplied kit.[210][211] On July 12, 2016, bowing to two weeks of rising pressure in China, IKEA announced that it was extending this recall to that country, which - along with Europe - was initially excluded from the recall.[212] Over 29 million dressers have been recalled.[213][214][215] IKEA has settled wrongful death lawsuits for over $50 million in compensation to the families of the three children who were killed.[216][217]\\r\\nIn 2014, documents were found at the Securitate archives in Bucharest which indicated that IKEA's open purchase of Romanian lumber throughout the 1980s was part of a complex scheme (codenamed \\"Scandinavica\\") to fund the Securitate and allow the accumulation of foreign currency: the Romanian lumber company Tehnoforestexport would regularly overcharge IKEA, transfer the overpayments into private Securitate bank accounts, wait for interest to accrue, and then reimburse IKEA the principal. IKEA has denied complicity in Scandinavica, but has begun an internal investigation to learn more.[218]\\r\\nIKEA has over 400 stores around the world. Among the countries that have double-digit IKEA stores are Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\\r\\nCoordinates: 521002N 42855E? / ?52.1673N 4.4819E? / 52.1673; 4.4819","input":"When did the first ikea store open in the uk?"},{"output":"September 1, 2016","context":"Since 2016, some U.S. professional athletes have silently protested police brutality and racial inequality during the playing of the U.S. national anthem.[1] The demonstrations have generated mixed reactions. Some have called the protests unpatriotic and disrespectful of the U.S. flag, the national anthem, the police, and the military.[2][3]\\r\\nThe protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat and later kneeled during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's preseason games of 2016.[4] Throughout the 2016 season, members of various NFL and other sports teams have engaged in similar silent protests. On September 24, 2017, the NFL protests became more widespread when over 200 players sat or kneeled in response to Donald Trump's calling for owners to fire the protesting players.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a longstanding tradition in the United States to play The Star-Spangled Banner, the national anthem, before sporting events.[6] Those present should stand at attention with right hand over heart.[7][8] NFL players were not mandated to be on the field for the playing of the national anthem until 2009.[9] The NFL has stated that \\"players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the National Anthem\\"; its game operations manual reads that players \\"should stand\\" for the anthem.[10]\\r\\nAmericans are divided on the intended meaning of the anthem. Some believe it salutes military and police officers who have died on duty; for others, it honors America generally.[6][11] Kaepernick and his 49er teammate Eric Reid say they choose to kneel during the anthem to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. \\"After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem as a peaceful protest,\\" said Reid. \\"We chose to kneel because its a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.\\"[12] Others believe that kneeling during the national anthem is an unacceptable way to draw attention to social issues and find it highly disrespectful to members of the military and police officers who have died or been wounded in service of the United States.[13]\\r\\nCriminal justice reform is one of the top issues that NFL players have been protesting.[14] Kaepernick was initially moved to protest by the deaths of African Americans by police actions or while in police custody that gained prominence through the Black Lives Matter movement and through general reporting in recent years.[15] During a post-game interview on August 26, 2016, he stated, \\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder\\", adding that he would continue to protest during the anthem until he feels like \\"[the American flag] represents what it's supposed to represent.\\"[16][17]\\r\\nAfter that interview, Kaepernick pledged to donate the first $1 million of his $11.9 million salary from the 2016ÿ2017 season to different organizations that help communities in need.[18] He pledged to donate $100,000 per month for 10 months to various organizations.[19] Days later, the San Francisco 49ers matched Kaepernick by pledging $1 million to two organizations addressing racial and social inequality.[20] Kaepernick has been following through on his commitment and has donated $900,000 as of September 2017 to groups including Meals on Wheels, United We Dream, Black Veterans for Social Justice and many others.[21][22] Kaepernick has also held Know Your Rights camps for young people of color.[23] The camps include legal education from attorneys that give advice on how to interact with police when being detained and lectures from prominent academics on the history of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.[24][25] The NFL Players Union named Kaepernick the Week One MVP in September 2017 for his charity work related to the protest.[26]\\r\\nIn September 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, said NFL owners should fire players who kneel during the national anthem, and encouraged fans to walk out. Trump advised NFL owners to say \\"Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired!\\"[27] Trump called the players' protest \\"a total disrespect of our heritage.\\"[28][29] He went on to say that new NFL safety rules meant to protect players from concussions are ruining the game.[30] His statement came after new research indicates NFL players are at high risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to the likelihood of multiple head injuries.[31]\\r\\nAlthough 70 percent of NFL players were black,[32] Trump denied his criticism of the protesters was related to race. \\"This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag,\\" he said.[33] In the games immediately following Trump's statements, the protest gained broader participation when over 200 players sat or kneeled during the anthem, others linked arms with their teammates or raised fists, and three teams chose to stay in the locker room for the anthem.[34][4][5][35] However, the response was more a reaction to Trump than Kaepernick's original protests of racial injustice.[35][36][37] Reasons cited by players, owners, and coaches included supporting freedom of speech and opposing what they considered intimidation by Trump.[35] Others said they took offense to Trump demeaning the integrity of their primarily African American colleagues, when a month earlier he had called some of the white nationalists who protested in Charlottesville, Virginia, \\"Very fine people\\".[38][39] The reaction to Trump's remarks overshadowed other ongoing issues his administration was facing, including failed attempts at healthcare reform, the primary election loss of Trump-backed candidate Luther Strange for the Alabama seat in the U.S. Senate, recovery efforts for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Harvey in Houston, and relations with North Korea over their nuclear and missile testing.[40]\\r\\nKaepernick began sitting during the national anthem at the start of the 2016 NFL preseason. His actions went unnoticed for two weeks before he was questioned by the media.[41] In the 49ers' final 2016 preseason game on September 1, 2016, after talking to Boyer, Kaepernick opted to kneel during the U.S. national anthem rather than sit as he did in their previous games. He explained his decision to switch was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members while still protesting during the anthem. Reid joined Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem during the final preseason game.[42] Seattle Seahawks player Jeremy Lane also did not stand for the anthem during his final preseason game the same day, stating, \\"It's something I plan to keep on doing until justice is being served.\\"[43]\\r\\nIn Week 1, eleven NFL players joined Kaepernick's protests.[44] Denver Broncos player Brandon Marshall knelt during the national anthem prior to the start of the Kickoff game, which was broadcast on NBC.[45] The act of kneeling as protest has been referred to as \\"taking a knee\\".[46][47][48] Kaepernick and Marshall were teammates at the University of Nevada.[45] On September 11, Kansas City Chiefs player Marcus Peters raised his fist while the rest of the team interlocked their arms showing solidarity.[49] Two members of the New England Patriots, Devin McCourty and Martellus Bennett, raised their fists on Sunday Night Football. The entire Seattle Seahawks team stood and interlocked arms.[50] Jelani Jenkins, Arian Foster, Kenny Stills, and Michael Thomas of the Miami Dolphins all kneeled during the National Anthem.[51] At the same time, a group of Jacksonville Jaguars players, led by cornerback Prince Amukamara, initially planned to join the protest but chose not to do so after photographs of Kaepernick wearing socks with a crude anti-police message during training camp were made public.[52]\\r\\nOn November 13, 2016, following the election of Donald Trump as the President-elect, Mike Evans wide-receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers decided to sit during the national anthem. According to Sports Illustrated, Evans said, \\"If this happens, then America's not right right now. I said this a long time ago. When he ran, I thought it was a joke, and the joke continues. I'm not a political person that much, but I got common sense. And I know when something's not right.\\"[53] However, his protest began the day following Veterans Day, so he received criticism. He quickly changed his method of protesting and joined his teammates during the following game against the Kansas City Chiefs. He apologized to veterans and other members of the military for his actions ÿ citing that the timing of his protest was poor. \\"On the field, I'm going to continue to do what I do ÿ play hard. I'm playing hard because I've got this right ÿ freedom, because of the vets. I'm going to reach out to organizations, organizations that I feel are doing the best job to help the minority ... women, LGBT, African Americans, Latinos, people that are in fear of Donald Trump and his presidency.\\"[54]\\r\\nCleveland Browns tight end Seth DeValve became the first white football player to kneel or sit during the anthem on the team's August 21, 2017 preseason game against the New York Giants.[55]\\r\\nIn Week 3 of the season the majority of games were played two days after Trump made his statements.[56] The protest gained broader participation when over 200 players sat or kneeled during the anthem.[5][4][34] Many players, coaches and NFL teams protested and/or issued statements expressing dismay with Trump's comments:[57]\\r\\nIn Week 8 at Seattle, the majority of the Texans' players kneeled during the anthem after Houston owner Bob McNair had commented about having the \\"inmates running the prison\\" during a league owner meeting regarding the ongoing protest. McNair had apologized, stating that he was not referring to the players, but rather to the \\"relationship between the league office and team owners.\\"[76][77] It was the first time a Texans' player had knelt during the anthem.[78]\\r\\nSeattle Reign FC and U.S. women's national soccer team player Megan Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem in a game on September 5, 2016, explaining that her decision was a \\"nod to Kaepernick and everything that he's standing for right now\\".[79] In a subsequent match at the Washington Spirit, Spirit owner Bill Lynch ÿ anticipating Rapinoe's protest ÿ moved the national anthem's performance without warning or notice to occur before the players' appearances on the pitch. Jeff Plush, the league's commissioner, was present at the game and told reporters that he was unaware of Lynch's plans and disagreed with the act of moving the anthem's performance.[80] The Spirit's players issued a joint statement also disagreeing with Lynch's decision to move the anthem without first consulting the team's players or coaches.[81]\\r\\nAs a member of the U.S. women's national soccer team, Rapinoe also knelt before an international friendly match against Thailand on September 16, despite public statements of disagreement with her protest methods issued before the match by the U.S. Soccer Federation and her coach Jill Ellis.[82] U.S. Soccer proceeded to pass a policy that now requires all of its players to stand respectfully during the national anthem making it the first American sports league or governing body to do so.[83]\\r\\nOn September 7, 2016, three volleyball players from West Virginia Tech knelt during the national anthem.[84][85]\\r\\nOn October 1, at East Carolina University, about 19 members of the band kneeled, while about another two held the American flag during the national anthem at the beginning of the football game against the University of Central Florida.[86] There have been almost no such incidents involving college football players, for the simple reason that college players and coaches are typically in the locker room when the anthem is played. There has been at least one exception to the rule, however. During a September 2016 away game at Northwestern, where players are traditionally on the field during the anthem, three Nebraska players knelt on the sideline.[87][88] The NCAA football rule book does not address the issue of pregame ceremonies (patriotic or otherwise) at all, except to say that team captains must be present for a coin toss three minutes before the first-half kickoff.\\r\\nOn September 2, 2016, a football player at Brunswick High School in Ohio knelt during the national anthem after he heard his teammates saying \\"nigger\\".[85] After his protest, the player received racial threats.[89] On September 9, high school players across the country knelt during the national anthem. On September 23, four players from Withrow High School, three black and one white, in Cincinnati knelt during the national anthem before their football game.[85]\\r\\nIn September 2017, Principal Waylon Bates of Parkway High School in Louisiana referred to the national anthem protests as a \\"disruption\\" and threatened to kick any player off of the football team if he knelt during the national anthem.[90] Two black students on the Victory & Praise Christian Academy football team protested during the anthem. Immediately after the anthem concluded, their coach removed them from the team, having them take off their uniforms on the sidelines.[91]\\r\\nOn September 23, 2017, Bruce Maxwell of the Oakland Athletics knelt during the national anthem, becoming the first MLB player to join the protest. His team backed him up by saying, \\"The Oakland A's pride ourselves on being inclusive. We respect and support all of our players' constitutional rights and freedom of expression.\\"[92][93] Maxwell received a standing ovation from A's fans before his first at-bat following his protest.[94]\\r\\nOn September 24, 2017, prior to Game 1 of the 2017 WNBA Finals, players from the Los Angeles Sparks chose to stay in the locker room during the national anthem, while members of the Minnesota Lynx locked arms on the court.[95]\\r\\nOn October 7, 2017, J. T. Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning raised his fist while standing on the bench during the national anthem. He had also done the same in a preseason game, in an attempt to \\"bring awareness to police brutality against minorities and racial inequality.\\"[96] He stated that he had \\"received death threats\\" after the protest.[97]\\r\\nIn September 2016, President Barack Obama stated that Kaepernick was \\"exercising his constitutional right\\" to protest. He went on: \\"I don't doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about.

The series stars Jay North as Dennis Mitchell; Herbert Anderson as his father, Henry; Gloria Henry as his mother, Alice; Joseph Kearns as George Wilson; Gale Gordon as George's brother, John Wilson; Sylvia Field as George's wife, Martha Wilson; and Sara Seegar as John's wife, Eloise Wilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally sponsored by Kellogg's cereals and Best Foods (Skippy peanut butter), the series was produced by Dariell Productions and Screen Gems.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show follows the lives of the Mitchell family ÿ Henry, Alice, and their only child, Dennis, an energetic, trouble-prone, mischievous, but well-meaning boy, who often tangles first with his peace-and-quiet-loving neighbor, George Wilson, a retired salesman, and later with George's brother John, a writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the series was based on the Dennis the Menace comic strip, there are differences between the two are seen. On the sitcom and in the comics, Dennis is basically a good, well-intentioned boy who always tries to help people, but winds up making situations worse - often at Mr. Wilson's expense. In early episodes of the first season, more outlandish disasters occuredas a result of his actions. The character of Dennis was toned down by the sixth or seventh episode. Instead of Dennis's dog Ruff, a smaller Cairn Terrier (per the episode \\"Miss Cathcart's Friend\\") named Fremont belonged to George and Martha Wilson. He did not appear during the fourth season, when John and Eloise Wilson moved into 625 Elm Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith CBS seeking to replace the hit show it had lost when it allowed Leave It to Beaver to migrate to ABC, a pilot episode titled \\"Dennis Goes To The Movies\\" was filmed in late 1958. In the pilot, Dennis was younger and his speech, the tone of his voice, and character had not been as developed as in episodes later in the 1959ÿ1960 season. In the episode, Dennis causes much destruction such as burying a hose (installing an automatic sprinkler system), trying to repair a leg on the kitchen table and causing It to collapse, and almost knocking Mr. Wilson off the ladder, but causing him to ruin his shoes as he steps in a can of paint, among other things. Dennis's father and mother then announce that they are going to the movies to see a Western (that Dennis wanted to see \\"all my life\\") and that Dennis would stay home with a babysitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause none of the babysitters in the neighborhood would help out because of Dennis's mischief, the Mitchells find an older lady, Mrs. Porter (Madge Blake), who had never met Dennis. Dennis then switches places with Joey and sneaks out to the same movie his parents are seeing. Joey stays home, while Mrs. Porter thinks he is Dennis. Meanwhile, Dennis causes havoc at the theater, even demanding that the projectionist repeat a scene. His parents suspect that Dennis is there causing these problems and call Mrs. Porter at the house. Mrs. Porter assures them that Dennis has been well behaved. Dennis beats his parents home and is in bed by the time they return, but he makes noises trying to borrow Mr. Wilson's ladder to climb back into his upstairs bedroom window.  This causes Mr. Wilson to go outside to see what is wrong. Mr. Wilson is arrested for armed robbery when he is found with Dennis's toy gun. The final scene where Joey jumps into bed with Dennis was filmed in the summer of 1959, after half a dozen episodes had been filmed (Dennis was several months older, has a different hairstyle, and is wearing different clothes) to make the episode fit the half-hour time segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1959, several other episodes were filmed, including \\"The Fishing Trip\\", \\"Dennis Gets a Duck\\", \\"Dennis Runs Away\\", \\"The Cowboy\\", \\"Open House\\" (where Margaret made her debut, this episode was made prior to \\"The Sign Post\\", but aired after), and \\"Dennis Becomes a Babysitter\\" (in which Margaret also appears).  At that point, CBS consented to air the program at 7:30?pm ET on Sunday evenings after Lassie. After viewing these episodes, CBS determined that Dennis's antics had to be toned down because of fear that his actions would encourage children watching the show to imitate Dennis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral weeks before the series debuted, the episode \\"The Sign Post\\" was produced in which Tommy made his debut. Margaret, who appeared in two episodes that were made before, but aired after, also appeared along with Joey. After the pilot aired as the first episode, \\"The Sign Post\\" aired and after that \\"Fishing Trip\\", the second episode, aired. After that, newly made episodes aired mixed in with the initial batch made earlier in 1959, which explains why \\"Dennis Runs Away\\", which was the fourth or fifth episode was run later in the first run, and shows an obviously younger Dennis as in the earlier episodes. Also, the episode \\"Dennis and The Rare Coin\\" was aired before \\"Dennis Runs Away\\", but aired after. On both episodes, Dennis is at the police station. On \\"Dennis and The Rare Coin\\" where Dennis is given milk, he states, \\"last time I came here I got ice cream\\", referring to the episode \\"Dennis Runs Away\\" where he got an ice cream cone at the police station, which was made before, but aired after. Joey was gradually phased out in season one. Dennis's friend Stewart appeared in only a few episodes in the first season and was played by Ron Howard (who soon after became Opie Taylor on The Andy Griffith Show).\\r\\n\\r\\nDennis and Mr. Wilson had a love-hate relationship, with Dennis always aggravating Mr. Wilson, but usually without realizing it. He would call Mr. Wilson his \\"best friend\\", and often referred to him as \\"Good 'Ol Mr. Wilson\\", while on many occasions, Mr. Wilson would tell Dennis, \\"You have far better friends than me.\\" Mrs. Wilson, however, loved Dennis in a grandmotherly way and tried to make the situation better between the two. Other neighbors and townspeople aired on a recurring basis included Mrs. Lucy Elkins (a widowed neighbor and the town gossip), Mrs. Dorothy Holland (another widow who aired on a recurring basis in season one only), Miss Esther Cathcart (a lonely spinster), Mr. Otis Quigley (the grocer), Opie Swanson (the TV/appliance store owner), Mr. Lawrence Finch (the druggist), Sgt. Harold Mooney (the policeman), Mr. Krinkie (the newspaper editor), and Buzz (the local handyman), among others.  Dennis also had a nemesis named Johnny Brady, whose father and Henry Mitchell also were sometimes at odds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond- and third-season episodes began to focus on Dennis at school learning to read, going to camp, playing baseball, being in scouting, and trying to help Mr. Wilson. Dennis was gradually maturing, and at times, Mr. Wilson is revealed to like Dennis deep down. In the fourth season, Dennis is no longer seen in his trademark overalls, and is instead wearing regular pants. Also, the famous striped shirt goes from a crew-neck to a \\"polo\\"-type shirt with a collar and buttons.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 17, 1962, after filming the show's 100th episode, Joseph Kearns died of a cerebral hemorrhage. In a 2010 interview, actress Gloria Henry revealed Kearns followed a strict six-week Metrecal diet that may have contributed to his death.[2] The following two episodes were filmed without the character of Mr. Wilson. Gale Gordon joined the cast for the last six episodes of the season as Mr. Wilson's brother, John. Gordon bore a closer resemblance to the comic strip's Mr. Wilson than Kearns did. It was explained that John was staying as a guest while George was settling an estate back east. Sylvia Field, who played Martha Wilson, was let go at the end of the season. In the fourth and final season, John Wilson purchased the house from his brother, although where George and Martha had moved was never explained. He was joined by his wife, Eloise, played by Sara Seegar. Final references to George and Martha Wilson were made early in the fourth season, although they were not mentioned by name after the first episode. George Wilson was referred to as \\"the other Mr. Wilson\\" in the second episode, and John Wilson says in the seventh episode he bought the house from his brother. After that, the original Wilsons were never mentioned again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers appearing on the series include:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fictional \\"Blondie Street\\" located at Columbia Ranch in Burbank, California (now the Warner Ranch) was the backdrop for the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mitchells' house was constructed between 1934 and 1935 for the movie Party Wire. It was later moved and became well known as the home of the Stone family on The Donna Reed Show in 1958, before becoming the home of the Mitchell family in 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wilsons' house was constructed between 1936 and 1937 for the Blondie film series. This structure, after some transformation, became well known as the home of the Andersons in Father Knows Best before becoming the home of the Wilsons, and later, the home of Major Nelson and Jeannie in I Dream of Jeannie.  The house can also be seen in episodes of Bewitched and The Partridge Family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Partridge Family house, located on the same street, was used as the home of Mrs. Elkins (a Mitchell neighbor).  It can be seen in the episode \\"The Man Next Door\\" (season three, episode 30) in which Mr. Wilson and Dennis believe  a jewel thief is living next door and climb into a basement window of the home.  It was also used as Miss Cathcart's house in the episode \\"Miss Cathcart's Sunsuit\\" (season one, episode 32). The corner church, together with The Partridge Family house, burned down in a fire in August 1970. Both were rebuilt to specification, albeit the church was moved further back and in a different configuration and smaller. Prior to The Partridge Family, the house facade was used by the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Kravitz on Bewitched.  Now, all of these houses still exist at the Warner Ranch and are used primarily as storage space and production offices across from the suburban park it faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe garage of the well-known address, 1164 Morning Glory Circle, used as the Bewitched house, can also be seen in several episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the show's fourth season, Jay North was 11 years old and was outgrowing the antics associated with his character. CBS cancelled Dennis the Menace in the spring of 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, NBC began airing reruns of the series on Saturday mornings for two seasons - the show entered syndication in 1965. It has run consistently on local stations over subsequent years. On July 1, 1985,[12] the Nickelodeon cable network began airing the series, and continued until October 21, 1994.[13] It also aired on TV Land from 2002 to 2003. On January 3, 2011, Dennis the Menace began airing on Antenna TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was exported to the United Kingdom and shown on the ITV network, with 103 episodes airing in the London region between 1960 and 1966.

It was established and ruled by the Timurid dynasty with Turco-Mongol Chagatai roots from Central Asia, claiming direct descent from both Genghis Khan (through his son Chagatai Khan) and Timur,[11][12][13] but with significant Indian Rajput and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances;[14][15] only the first two Mughal emperors were fully Central Asian.[16] The dynasty was Indo-Persian in culture,[17] combining Persianate culture[10][18] with local Indian cultural influences[17] visible in its traits and customs.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginning of the empire is conventionally dated to the victory by its founder Babur over Ibrahim Lodi, the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, in the First Battle of Panipat (1526).  During the reign of Humayun, the successor of Babur, the empire was briefly interrupted by the Sur Empire. The \\"classic period\\" of the Mughal Empire started in 1556 with the ascension of Akbar the Great to the throne.  Some Rajput kingdoms continued to pose a significant threat to the Mughal dominance of northwestern India, but most of them were subdued by Akbar. All Mughal emperors were Muslims; Akbar, however, propounded a syncretic religion in the latter part of his life called Dؐn-i Ilhؐ, as recorded in historical books like Ain-i-Akbari and Dabistn-i Mazhib.[20] The Mughal Empire did not try to intervene in the local societies during most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[21][22] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[23] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[24] Traditional and newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, the Pashtuns, the Hindu Jats and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[25][26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nInternal dissatisfaction arose due to the weakness of the empire's administrative and economic systems, leading to its break-up and declarations of independence of its former provinces by the Nawab of Bengal, the Nawab of Awadh, the Nizam of Hyderabad and other small states. In 1739, the Mughals were crushingly defeated in the Battle of Karnal by the forces of Nader Shah, the founder of the Afsharid dynasty in Persia, and Delhi was sacked and looted, drastically accelerating their decline. By the mid-18th century, the Marathas had routed Mughal armies and won over several Mughal provinces from the Punjab to Bengal.[29] During the following century Mughal power had become severely limited, and the last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, had authority over only the city of Shahjahanabad. He issued a firman supporting the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and following the defeat was therefore tried by the British East India Company for treason, imprisoned and exiled to Rangoon.[30] The last remnants of the empire were formally taken over by the British, and the Government of India Act 1858 let the British Crown formally assume direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire at its peak extended over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent[6] and parts of Afghanistan. It was the third largest empire to have existed in the Indian subcontinent (along with the Maurya Empire and the British Indian Empire), spanning approximately four million square kilometres at its zenith,[5] second only to the Maurya Empire. The maximum expansion was reached during the reign of Aurangzeb, who ruled over more than 150 million subjects, nearly one quarter of the world's population at the time.[31] The Mughal Empire also ushered in a period of proto-industrialization,[32] and around the 17th century, Mughal India became the world's largest economic and manufacturing power,[33] producing a quarter of global industrial output up until the 18th century.[34][35] The Mughal Empire is considered \\"India's last golden age\\"[36] and one of the three Islamic Gunpowder Empires (along with the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia).[37] The reign of Shah Jahan, the fifth emperor, between 1628 and 1658, was the zenith of Mughal architecture with famous monuments such as the Taj Mahal and Moti Masjid at Agra, the Red Fort, the Jama Masjid, Delhi, and the Lahore Fort.\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporaries referred to the empire founded by Babur as the Timurid empire,[38] which reflected the heritage of his dynasty, and this was the term preferred by the Mughals themselves.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal designation for their own dynasty was Gurkani (Persian: ??????????, Grkniyn, meaning \\"sons-in-law\\").[8] The use of Mughal derived from the Arabic and Persian corruption of Mongol, and it emphasised the Mongol origins of the Timurid dynasty.[37] The term gained currency during the 19th century, but remains disputed by Indologists.[40] Similar terms had been used to refer to the empire, including \\"Mogul\\" and \\"Moghul\\".[10][41] Nevertheless, Babur's ancestors were sharply distinguished from the classical Mongols insofar as they were oriented towards Persian rather than Turco-Mongol culture.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother name for the empire was Hindustan, which was documented in the Ain-i-Akbari, and which has been described as the closest to an official name for the empire.[43] In the west, the term \\"Mughal\\" was used for the emperor, and by extension, the empire as a whole.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire was founded by Babur (reigned 1526ÿ1530), a Central Asian ruler who was descended from the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his father's side and from Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother's side.[45] Ousted from his ancestral domains in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass.[45] Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526.[45] The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun (reigned 1530ÿ1556), who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.[45] The Sur Empire (1540ÿ1555), founded by Sher Shah Suri (reigned 1540ÿ1545), briefly interrupted Mughal rule. Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing Persian cultural influence in the Mughal Empire. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun's triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAkbar the Great (reigned 1556ÿ1605) was born Jalal-ud-din Muhammad[46] in the Rajput Umarkot Fort,[47] to Humayun and his wife Hamida Banu Begum, a Persian princess.[48] Akbar succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.[45] Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari River. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government, and supported cultural developments.[45] At the same time, Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and economic development. Akbar allowed free expression of religion, and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult.[45] He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nJahangir (born Salim,[49] reigned 1605ÿ1627) was born to Akbar and his wife Mariam-uz-Zamani, an Indian Rajput princess.[50] Jahangir ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques.[45] Shah Jahan (reigned 1628ÿ1658) was born to Jahangir and his wife Jagat Gosaini, a Rajput princess.[49] During the reign of Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.[45] The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nShah Jahan's eldest son, the liberal Dara Shikoh, became regent in 1658, as a result of his father's illness. However, a younger son, Aurangzeb (reigned 1658ÿ1707), allied with the Islamic orthodoxy against his brother, who championed a syncretistic Hindu-Muslim culture, and ascended to the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed.[45] Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more.[45] Aurangzeb expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, many parts of the empire were in open revolt.[45] Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king,[51] with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society,[45] while other historians question this, noting that he built Hindu temples,[52] employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims,[53] and married Hindu Rajput princess Nawab Bai.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAurangzeb's son, Shah Alam, repealed the religious policies of his father, and attempted to reform the administration. However, after his death in 1712, the Mughal dynasty sank into chaos and violent feuds. In 1719 alone, four emperors successively ascended the throne.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the reign of Muhammad Shah (reigned 1719ÿ1748), the empire began to break up, and vast tracts of central India passed from Mughal to Maratha hands. The far-off Indian campaign of Nadir Shah, who had priorly reestablished Iranian suzerainty over most of West Asia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, culminated with the Sack of Delhi and shattered the remnants of Mughal power and prestige.[45] Many of the empire's elites now sought to control their own affairs, and broke away to form independent kingdoms.[45] But, according to Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Mughal Emperor continued to be the highest manifestation of sovereignty. Not only the Muslim gentry, but the Maratha, Hindu, and Sikh leaders took part in ceremonial acknowledgements of the emperor as the sovereign of India.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II (1759ÿ1806) made futile attempts to reverse the Mughal decline but ultimately had to seek the protection of the Emir of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Abdali, which led to the Third Battle of Panipat between the Maratha Empire and the Afghans led by Abdali in 1761. In 1771, the Marathas recaptured Delhi from Afghan control and in 1784 they officially became the protectors of the emperor in Delhi,[55] a state of affairs that continued further until after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Thereafter, the British East India Company became the protectors of the Mughal dynasty in Delhi.[54] The British East India Company took control of the former Mughal province of Bengal-Bihar in 1793 after it abolished local rule (Nizamat) that lasted until 1858, marking the beginning of British colonial era over the Indian Subcontinent. By 1857 a considerable part of former Mughal India was under the East India Company's control. After a crushing defeat in the war of 1857ÿ1858 which he nominally led, the last Mughal, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed by the British East India Company and exiled in 1858. Through the Government of India Act 1858 the British Crown assumed direct control of East India Company-held territories in India in the form of the new British Raj. In 1876 the British Queen Victoria assumed the title of Empress of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians have offered numerous explanations for the rapid collapse of the Mughal Empire between 1707 and 1720, after a century of growth and prosperity. In fiscal terms the throne lost the revenues needed to pay its chief officers, the emirs (nobles) and their entourages. The emperor lost authority, as the widely scattered imperial officers lost confidence in the central authorities, and made their own deals with local men of influence. The imperial army, bogged down in long, futile wars against the more aggressive Marathas lost its fighting spirit. Finally came a series of violent political feuds over control of the throne. After the execution of emperor Farrukhsiyar in 1719, local Mughal successor states took power in region after region.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporary chroniclers bewailed the decay they witnessed, a theme picked up by the first British historians who wanted to underscore the need for a British-led rejuvenation.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1970s historians have taken multiple approaches to the decline, with little consensus on which factor was dominant. The psychological interpretations emphasise depravity in high places, excessive luxury, and increasingly narrow views that left the rulers unprepared for an external challenge. A Marxist school (led by Irfan Habib and based at Aligarh Muslim University) emphasises excessive exploitation of the peasantry by the rich, which stripped away the will and the means to support the regime.[58] Karen Leonard has focused on the failure of the regime to work with Hindu bankers, whose financial support was increasingly needed; the bankers then helped the Maratha and the British.[59] In a religious interpretation, some scholars argue that the Hindu powers revolted against the rule of a Muslim dynasty.[60] Finally, other scholars argue that the very prosperity of the Empire inspired the provinces to achieve a high degree of independence, thus weakening the imperial court.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffrey G. Williamson has argued that the Indian economy went through deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire, with British rule later causing further deindustrialization.[62] According to Williamson, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to a decline in agricultural productivity, which drove up food prices, then nominal wages, and then textile prices, which led to India losing a share of the world textile market to Britain even before it had superior factory technology.[63] Indian textiles, however, still maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubah (Urdu: ????) was the term for a province in the Mughal Empire. The word is derived from Arabic. The governor of a Subah was known as a subahdar (sometimes also referred to as a \\"Subah\\"[65]), which later became subedar to refer to an officer in the Indian Army. The subahs were established by padshah (emperor) Akbar during his administrative reforms of 1572ÿ1580; initially they numbered 12, but his conquests expanded the number of subahs to 15 by the end of his reign. Subahs were divided into Sarkars, or districts. Sarkars were further divided into Parganas or Mahals. His successors, most notably Aurangzeb, expanded the number of subahs further through their conquests. As the empire began to dissolve in the early 18th century, many subahs became effectively independent, or were conquered by the Marathas or the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original twelve subahs created as a result of administrative reform by Akbar:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian economy was large and prosperous under the Mughal Empire.[66] During the Mughal era, the gross domestic product (GDP) of India in 1600 was estimated at about 22.4% of the world economy, the second largest in the world, behind only Ming China but larger than Europe. By 1700, the GDP of Mughal India had risen to 24.4% of the world economy, the largest in the world, larger than both Qing China and Western Europe.[67] Mughal India was the world leader in manufacturing,[33] producing about 25% of the world's industrial output up until the 18th century.[35] India's GDP growth increased under the Mughal Empire, with India's GDP having a faster growth rate during the Mughal era than in the 1,500 years prior to the Mughal era.[67] Mughal India's economy has been described as a form of proto-industrialization, like that of 18th-century Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals were responsible for building an extensive road system, creating a uniform currency, and the unification of the country.[68] The empire had an extensive road network, which was vital to the economic infrastructure, built by a public works department set up by the Mughals which designed, constructed and maintained roads linking towns and cities across the empire, making trade easier to conduct.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals adopted and standardized the rupee (rupiya, or silver) and dam (copper) currencies introduced by Sur Emperor Sher Shah Suri during his brief rule.[69] The currency was initially 48 dams to a single rupee in the beginning of Akbar's reign, before it later became 38 dams to a rupee in the 1580s, with the dam's value rising further in the 17th century as a result of new industrial uses for copper, such as in bronze cannons and brass utensils. The dam was initially the most common coin in Akbar's time, before being replaced by the rupee as the most common coin in succeeding reigns.[7] The dam's value was later worth 30 to a rupee towards the end of Jahangir's reign, and then 16 to a rupee by the 1660s.[70] The Mughals minted coins with high purity, never dropping below 96%, and without debasement until the 1720s.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite India having its own stocks of gold and silver, the Mughals produced minimal gold of their own, but mostly minted coins from imported bullion, as a result of the empire's strong export-driven economy, with global demand for Indian agricultural and industrial products drawing a steady stream of precious metals into India.[7] Around 80% of Mughal India's imports were bullion, mostly silver,[72] with major sources of imported bullion including the New World and Japan,[71] which in turn imported large quantities of textiles and silk from the Bengal Subah province.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire's workforce in the early 17th century consisted of about 64% in the primary sector (including agriculture) and 36% in the secondary and tertiary sectors, including over 11% in the secondary sector (manufacturing) and about 25% in the tertiary sector (service).[74] Mughal India's workforce had a higher percentage in the non-primary sector than Europe's workforce did at the time; agriculture accounted for 65ÿ90% of Europe's workforce in 1700, and 65ÿ75% in 1750, including 65% of England's workforce in 1750.[75] In terms of contributions to the Mughal economy, in the late 16th century, the primary sector contributed 52.4%, the secondary sector 18.2% and the tertiary sector 29.4%; the secondary sector contributed a higher percentage than in early 20th-century British India, where the secondary sector only contributed 11.2% to the economy.[76] In terms of urban-rural divide, 18% of Mughal India's labour force were urban and 82% were rural, contributing 52% and 48% to the economy, respectively.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nReal wages and living standards in 18th-century Mughal Bengal and South India were higher than in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.[78][62] According to economic historian Paul Bairoch, India as well as China had a higher GNP per capita than Europe up until the late 18th century,[79][80] before Western European per-capita income pulled ahead after 1800.[81] Mughal India also had a higher per-capita income in the late 16th century than British India did in the early 20th century.[76] However, in a system where wealth was hoarded by elites, wages were depressed for manual labour,[82] though no less than labour wages in Europe at the time.[78] In Mughal India, there was a generally tolerant attitude towards manual labourers, with some religious cults in northern India proudly asserting a high status for manual labour. While slavery also existed, it was limited largely to household servants.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian agricultural production increased under the Mughal Empire.[66] A variety of crops were grown, including food crops such as wheat, rice, and barley, and non-food cash crops such as cotton, indigo and opium. By the mid-17th century, Indian cultivators begun to extensively grow two new crops from the Americas, maize and tobacco.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal administration emphasized agrarian reform, which began under the non-Mughal emperor Sher Shah Suri, the work of which Akbar adopted and furthered with more reforms. The civil administration was organized in a hierarchical manner on the basis of merit, with promotions based on performance.[3] The Mughal government funded the building of irrigation systems across the empire, which produced much higher crop yields and increased the net revenue base, leading to increased agricultural production.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nA major Mughal reform introduced by Akbar was a new land revenue system called zabt. He replaced the tribute system, previously common in India and used by Tokugawa Japan at the time, with a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency.[83] The revenue system was biased in favour of higher value cash crops such as cotton, indigo, sugar cane, tree-crops, and opium, providing state incentives to grow cash crops, in addition to rising market demand.[84] Under the zabt system, the Mughals also conducted extensive cadastral surveying to assess the area of land under plow cultivation, with the Mughal state encouraging greater land cultivation by offering tax-free periods to those who brought new land under cultivation.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal agriculture was in some ways advanced compared to European agriculture at the time, exemplified by the common use of the seed drill among Indian peasants before its adoption in Europe.[86] While the average peasant across the world was only skilled in growing very few crops, the average Indian peasant was skilled in growing a wide variety of food and non-food crops, increasing their productivity.[87] Indian peasants were also quick to adapt to profitable new crops, such as maize and tobacco from the New World being rapidly adopted and widely cultivated across Mughal India between 1600 and 1650. Bengali farmers rapidly learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and sericulture, establishing Bengal Subah as a major silk-producing region of the world.[84] Sugar mills appeared in India shortly before the Mughal era. Evidence for the use of a draw bar for sugar-milling appears at Delhi in 1540, but may also date back earlier, and was mainly used in the northern Indian subcontinent. Geared sugar rolling mills first appeared in Mughal India, using the principle of rollers as well as worm gearing, by the 17th century.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to evidence cited by the economic historians Immanuel Wallerstein, Irfan Habib, Percival Spear, and Ashok Desai, per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption in 17th-century Mughal India were higher than in 17th-century Europe and early 20th-century British India.[89] The increased agricultural productivity led to lower food prices. In turn, this benefited the Indian textile industry. Compared to Britain, the price of grain was about one-half in South India and one-third in Bengal, in terms of silver coinage. This resulted in lower silver coin prices for Indian textiles, giving them a price advantage in global markets.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nUp until the 18th century, Mughal India was the most important center of manufacturing in international trade.[33] Up until 1750, India produced about 25% of the world's industrial output.[62] Manufactured goods and cash crops from the Mughal Empire were sold throughout the world. Key industries included textiles, shipbuilding, and steel. Processed products included cotton textiles, yarns, thread, silk, jute products, metalware, and foods such as sugar, oils and butter.[66] The growth of manufacturing industries in the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal era in the 17thÿ18th centuries has been referred to as a form of proto-industrialization, similar to 18th-century Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early modern Europe, there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as spices, peppers, indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions).[66] European fashion, for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. From the late 17th century to the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia.[90] In contrast, there was very little demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient, thus Europeans had very little to offer, except for some woolens, unprocessed metals and a few luxury items. The trade imbalance caused Europeans to export large quantities of gold and silver to Mughal India in order to pay for South Asian imports.[66] Indian goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in large quantities to other Asian markets, such as Indonesia and Japan.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest manufacturing industry in the Mughal Empire was textile manufacturing, particularly cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of piece goods, calicos, and muslins, available unbleached and in a variety of colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for a large part of the empire's international trade.[66] India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century.[91] Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan.[33] By the early 18th century, Mughal Indian textiles were clothing people across the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East.[63] The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nBengal accounted for more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks imported by the Dutch from Asia,[90] Bengali silk and cotton textiles were exported in large quantities to Europe, Indonesia, and Japan,[73] and Bengali muslin textiles from Dhaka were sold in Central Asia, where they were known as \\"daka\\" textiles.[92] Indian textiles dominated the Indian Ocean trade for centuries, were sold in the Atlantic Ocean trade, and had a 38% share of the West African trade in the early 18th century, while Indian calicos were a major force in Europe, and Indian textiles accounted for 20% of total English trade with Southern Europe in the early 18th century.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worm gear roller cotton gin, which was invented in India during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13thÿ14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century,[88] and is still used in India through to the present day.[93] Another innovation, the incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.[94] The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal India had a large shipbuilding industry, which was also largely centered in the Bengal province. In terms of shipbuilding tonnage during the 16thÿ18th centuries, the annual output of Bengal alone totaled around 2,232,500 tons, larger than the combined output of the Dutch (450,000ÿ550,000 tons), the British (340,000 tons), and North America (23,061 tons).[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals maintained a small fleet for carrying pilgrims to Mecca, and imported Arabian horses in Surat. Debal in Sindh was mostly autonomous. The Mughals also maintained various river fleets of Dhows, which transported soldiers over rivers and fought rebels. Among its admirals were Yahya Saleh, Munnawar Khan, and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh. The Mughals also protected the Siddis of Janjira. Its sailors were renowned and often voyaged to China and the East African Swahili Coast, together with some Mughal subjects carrying out private-sector trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian shipbuilding, particularly in Bengal, was advanced compared to European shipbuilding at the time, with Indians selling ships to European firms. Ship-repairing, for example, was very advanced in Bengal, where European shippers visited to repair vessels.[97] An important innovation in shipbuilding was the introduction of a flushed deck design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in hulls that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. The British East India Company later duplicated the flushed deck and hull designs of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bengal Subah province was especially prosperous from the time of its takeover by the Mughals in 1590 until the British East India Company seized control in 1757.[99] It was the Mughal Empire's wealthiest province,[100] and the economic powerhouse of the Mughal Empire, generating 50% of the empire's GDP.[101] Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as rice, silks and cotton textiles. Overseas, Europeans depended on Bengali products such as cotton textiles, silks and opium; Bengal accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia, for example, including more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks.[90] From Bengal, saltpeter was also shipped to Europe, opium was sold in Indonesia, raw silk was exported to Japan and the Netherlands, and cotton and silk textiles were exported to Europe, Indonesia and Japan.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nBengal was described as the Paradise of Nations by Mughal emperors.[102] The Mughals introduced agrarian reforms, including the modern Bengali calendar.[103] The calendar played a vital role in developing and organising harvests, tax collection and Bengali culture in general, including the New Year and Autumn festivals. The province was a leading producer of grains, salt, pearls, fruits, liquors and wines, precious metals and ornaments.[104] Its handloom industry flourished under royal warrants, making the region a hub of the worldwide muslin trade, which peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries. The provincial capital Dhaka became the commercial capital of the empire. The Mughals expanded cultivated land in the Bengal delta under the leadership of Sufis, which consolidated the foundation of Bengali Muslim society.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 150 years of rule by Mughal viceroys, Bengal gained semi-independence as a dominion under the Nawab of Bengal in 1717. The Nawabs permitted European companies to set up trading posts across the region, including firms from Britain, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal and Austria-Hungary. An Armenian community dominated banking and shipping in major cities and towns. The Europeans regarded Bengal as the richest place for trade.[104] By the late 18th century, the British displaced the Mughal ruling class in Bengal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's population growth accelerated under the Mughal Empire, with an unprecedented economic and demographic upsurge which boosted the Indian population by 60%[106] to 253% in 200 years during 1500ÿ1700.[107] The Indian population had a faster growth during the Mughal era than at any known point in Indian history prior to the Mughal era.[106][67] The increased population growth rate was stimulated by Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[84] By the time of Aurangzeb's reign, there were a total of 455,698 villages in the Mughal Empire.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table gives population estimates for the Mughal Empire, compared to the total population of India, including the regions of modern Pakistan and Bangladesh, and compared to the world population:\\r\\n\\r\\nCities and towns boomed under the Mughal Empire, which had a relatively high degree of urbanization for its time, with 15% of its population living in urban centres.[36] This was higher than the percentage of the urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and higher than that of British India in the 19th century;[36] the level of urbanization in Europe did not reach 15% until the 19th century.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Akbar's reign in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, 15% of the empire's total population. This was larger the entire urban population in Europe at the time, and even a century later in 1700, the urban population of England, Scotland and Wales did not exceed 13% of its total population,[108] while British India had an urban population that was under 13% of its total population in 1800 and 9.3% in 1881, a decline from the earlier Mughal era.[111] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historian Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551ÿ1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, there were 120 large cities and 3200 townships.[36] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[36] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people, Lahore (in Lahore Subah) with up to 700,000 people,[113] Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people,[114] and Delhi (in Delhi Subah) with over 600,000 people.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nCities acted as markets for the sale of goods, and provided homes for a variety of merchants, traders, shopkeepers, artisans, moneylenders, weavers, craftspeople, officials, and religious figures.[66] However, a number of cities were military and political centres, rather than manufacturing or commerce centres.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal influence can be seen in cultural contributions such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals built Maktab schools in every province under their authority, where youth were taught the Quran and Islamic law such as the Fatawa-i-Alamgiri in their indigenous languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughals made a major contribution to the Indian subcontinent with development of their unique architecture. Many monuments were built during the Mughal era by the Muslim emperors, especially Shah Jahan, including the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known to be one of the finer examples of Mughal architecture. Other World Heritage Sites include Humayun's Tomb, Fatehpur Sikri, the Red Fort, the Agra Fort, and the Lahore Fort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palaces, tombs, and forts built by the dynasty stand today in Agra, Aurangabad, Delhi, Dhaka, Fatehpur Sikri, Jaipur, Lahore, Kabul, Sheikhupura, and many other cities of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.[122] With few memories of Central Asia, Babur's descendants absorbed traits and customs of South Asia[19] and became more or less naturalized. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the land the Mughals once ruled has separated into what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, their influence can still be seen widely today. Tombs of the emperors are spread throughout India, Afghanistan,[123] and Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal artistic tradition was eclectic, borrowing from the European Renaissance as well as from Persian and Indian sources. Kumar concludes, \\"The Mughal painters borrowed individual motifs and certain naturalistic effects from Renaissance and Mannerist painting, but their structuring principle was derived from Indian and Persian traditions.\\"[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Persian was the dominant and \\"official\\" language of the empire, the language of the elite was a Persianised form of Hindustani called Urdu. The language was written in a type of Perso-Arabic script known as Nastaliq, and with literary conventions and specialised vocabulary borrowed from Persian, Arabic and Turkic; the dialect was eventually given its own name of Urdu.[125] Modern Hindi, which uses Sanskrit-based vocabulary along with Perso-Arabic loan words is mutually intelligible with Urdu.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal India was one of the three Islamic Gunpowder Empires, along with the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia.[37][126][127] By the time he was invited by Lodi governor of Lahore, Daulat Khan, to support his rebellion against Lodi Sultan Ibrahim Khan, Babur was familiar with gunpowder firearms and field artillery, and a method for deploying them.  Babur had employed Ottoman expert Ustad Ali Quli, who showed Babur the standard Ottoman formationartillery and firearm-equipped infantry protected by wagons in the center and the mounted archers on both wings. Babur used this formation at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Afghan and Rajput forces loyal to the Delhi Sultanate, though superior in numbers but without the gunpowder weapons, were defeated. The decisive victory of the Timurid forces is one reason opponents rarely met Mughal princes in pitched battle over the course of the empire's history.[128] In India, guns made of bronze were recovered from Calicut (1504) and Diu (1533).[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nFathullah Shirazi (c. 1582), a Persian polymath and mechanical engineer who worked for Akbar, developed an early multi gun shot. As opposed to the polybolos and repeating crossbows used earlier in ancient Greece and China, respectively, Shirazi's rapid-firing gun had multiple gun barrels that fired hand cannons loaded with gunpowder. It may be considered a version of a volley gun.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 17th century, Indians were manufacturing a diverse variety of firearms; large guns in particular, became visible in Tanjore, Dacca, Bijapur and Murshidabad.[131] Gujart supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century,[132] and Mughal Bengal and Mlwa also participated in saltpeter production.[132] The Dutch, French, Portuguese and English used Chpra as a center of saltpeter refining.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 16th century, Akbar was the first to initiate and use metal cylinder rockets known as bans, particularly against war elephants, during the Battle of Sanbal.[134] In 1657, the Mughal Army used rockets during the Siege of Bidar.[135] Prince Aurangzeb's forces discharged rockets and grenades while scaling the walls. Sidi Marjan was mortally wounded when a rocket struck his large gunpowder depot, and after twenty-seven days of hard fighting Bidar was captured by the victorious Mughals.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder, James Riddick Partington described Indian rockets and explosive mines:[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian war rockets were formidable weapons before such rockets were used in Europe. They had bam-boo rods, a rocket-body lashed to the rod, and iron points. They were directed at the target and fired by lighting the fuse, but the trajectory was rather erratic. The use of mines and counter-mines with explosive charges of gunpowder is mentioned for the times of Akbar and Jahngir.\\r\\nLater, the Mysorean rockets were upgraded versions of Mughal rockets used during the Siege of Jinji by the progeny of the Nawab of Arcot. Hyder Ali's father Fatah Muhammad the constable at Budikote, commanded a corps consisting of 50 rocketmen (Cushoon) for the Nawab of Arcot. Hyder Ali realised the importance of rockets and introduced advanced versions of metal cylinder rockets. These rockets turned fortunes in favour of the Sultanate of Mysore during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, particularly during the Battle of Pollilur. In turn, the Mysorean rockets were the basis for the Congreve rockets, which Britain deployed in the Napoleonic Wars against France and the War of 1812 against the United States.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there appears to have been little concern for theoretical astronomy, Mughal astronomers  made advances in observational astronomy and produced nearly a hundred Zij treatises. Humayun built a personal observatory near Delhi; Jahangir and Shah Jahan were also intending to build observatories, but were unable to do so. The astronomical instruments and observational techniques used at the Mughal observatories were mainly derived from Islamic astronomy.[137][138] In the 17th century, the Mughal Empire saw a synthesis between Islamic and Hindu astronomy, where Islamic observational instruments were combined with Hindu computational techniques.[137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Hindu king Jai Singh II of Amber continued the work of Mughal astronomy. In the early 18th century, he built several large observatories called Yantra Mandirs, in order to rival Ulugh Beg's Samarkand observatory, and in order to improve on the earlier Hindu computations in the Siddhantas and Islamic observations in Zij-i-Sultani. The instruments he used were influenced by Islamic astronomy, while the computational techniques were derived from Hindu astronomy.[137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nSake Dean Mahomed had learned much of Mughal chemistry and understood the techniques used to produce various alkali and soaps to produce shampoo. He was also a notable writer who described the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II and the cities of Allahabad and Delhi in rich detail and also made note of the glories of the Mughal Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain, Sake Dean Mahomed was appointed as shampooing surgeon to both Kings George IV and William IV.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most remarkable astronomical instruments invented in Mughal India is the seamless celestial globe. It was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998 AH (1589ÿ90 CE), and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams.[140]","input":"When did the mughal empire reach its peak?"},{"output":"two volumes","context":"Maus[a] is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodernist techniques and represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. Critics have classified Maus as memoir, biography, history, fiction, autobiography, or a mix of genres. In 1992, it became the first graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize (the Special Award in Letters).\\r\\nIn the frame-tale timeline in the narrative present that begins in 1978 in New York City, Spiegelman talks with his father Vladek about his Holocaust experiences, gathering material for the Maus project he is preparing. In the narrative past, Spiegelman depicts these experiences, from the years leading up to World War?II to his parents' liberation from the Nazi concentration camps. Much of the story revolves around Spiegelman's troubled relationship with his father, and the absence of his mother who committed suicide when he was 20. Her grief-stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of Auschwitz. The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing, structure, and page layouts.\\r\\nA three-page strip also called \\"Maus\\" that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War?II. The recorded interviews became the basis for the graphic novel, which Spiegelman began in 1978. He serialized Maus from 1980 until 1991 as an insert in Raw, an avant-garde comics and graphics magazine published by Spiegelman and his wife, Fran?oise Mouly, who also appears in Maus. A collected volume of the first six chapters that appeared in 1986 brought the book mainstream attention; a second volume collected the remaining chapters in 1991. Maus was one of the first graphic novels to receive significant academic attention in the English-speaking world.\\r\\nMost of the book weaves in and out of two timelines. In the frame tale of the narrative present,[1] Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the Rego Park neighborhood of New York City[2] in 1978ÿ79.[3] The story that Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past, which begins in the mid-1930s[2] and continues until the end of the Holocaust in 1945.[4]\\r\\nIn Rego Park in 1958,[3] a young Art Spiegelman complains to his father that his friends have left him behind. His father responds in broken English, \\"Friends? Your friends? If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week, then you could see what it is, friends!\\"[5]\\r\\nAs an adult, Art visits his father, from whom he has become estranged.[6] Vladek has remarried to a woman called Mala since the suicide in 1968 of Art's mother Anja.[7] Art asks Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences.[6] Vladek tells of his time in the Polish city Cz?stochowa[8] and how he came to marry into Anja's wealthy family in 1937 and move to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer. Vladek begs Art not to include this in the book, and Art reluctantly agrees.[9] Anja suffers a breakdown due to postpartum depression[10] after giving birth to their first son Richieu,[b] and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover. After they return, political and antisemitic tensions build until Vladek is drafted just before the Nazi invasion. Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a prisoner of war. After his release, he finds Germany has annexed Sosnowiec, and he is dropped off on the other side of the border in the German protectorate. He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family.[12]\\r\\nDuring one of Art's visits, he finds that a friend of Mala's has sent the couple one of the underground comix magazines Art contributed to. Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it. In \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\\",[13] Art is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital, and in the end depicts himself behind bars saying, \\"You murdered me, Mommy, and left me here to take the rap!\\"[14] Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.[15]\\r\\nIn 1943, the Nazis move the Jews of the Sosnowiec Ghetto to Srodula, and march them back to Sosnowiec to work. The family splits upVladek and Anja send Richieu to Zawiercie to stay with an aunt for safety. As more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz, the aunt poisons herself, her children, and Richieu to escape the Gestapo. In Srodula, many Jews build bunkers to hide from the Germans. Vladek's bunker is discovered and he is placed into a \\"ghetto inside the ghetto\\" surrounded by barbed wire. The remnants of Vladek and Anja's family are taken away.[12] Srodula is cleared of its Jews, except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker. When the Germans depart, the group splits up and leaves the ghetto.[16]\\r\\nIn Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja move from one hiding place to the next, making occasional contact with other Jews in hiding. Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions. The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, but it is a trickthe Gestapo arrest them on the train (as Hungary is invaded) and take them to Auschwitz, where they are separated until after the war.[16]\\r\\nArt asks after Anja's diaries, which Vladek tells him were her account of her Holocaust experiences and the only record of what happened to her after her separation from Vladek at Auschwitz, and which Vladek says she had wanted Art to read. Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself. Art is enraged, and calls Vladek a \\"murderer\\".[17]\\r\\nThe story jumps to 1986, after the first six chapters of Maus have appeared in a collected edition. Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives[4] and finds himself \\"totally blocked\\". Art talks about the book with his psychiatrist Paul Pavel, a Czech Holocaust survivor.[18] Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories, \\"maybe it's better not to have any more stories\\". Art replies with a quote from Samuel Beckett: \\"Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness\\", but then realizes, \\"on the other hand, he said it\\".[19]\\r\\nVladek tells of his hardship in the camps, of starvation and abuse, of his resourcefulness, of avoiding the selektionenthe process by which prisoners were selected for further labor or execution.[20] Despite the danger, Anja and Vladek exchange occasional messages. As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back, the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in occupied Poland to Gross-Rosen within the Reich, and then to Dachau, where the hardships only increase and Vladek catches typhus.[21]\\r\\nThe war ends, the camp survivors are freed, and Vladek and Anja reunite. The book closes with Vladek turning over in his bed as he finishes his story and telling Art, \\"I'm tired from talking, Richieu, and it's enough stories for now.\\"[22] The final image is of Vladek and Anja's tombstone[23]Vladek died in 1982, before the book was completed.[24]\\r\\nArt Spiegelman was born on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman. An aunt poisoned their first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis four years before Spiegelman's birth.[42] He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951.[43] During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it.[27]\\r\\nSpiegelman developed an interest in comics early and began drawing professionally at 16.[44] He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital in 1968 after a nervous breakdown. Shortly after he got out, his mother committed suicide.[2] Spiegelman's father was not happy with his son's involvement in the hippie subculture. Spiegelman said that when he bought himself a German Volkswagen it damaged their already-strained relationship \\"beyond repair\\".[45] Around this time, Spiegelman read in fanzines about such graphic artists as Frans Masereel who had made wordless novels. The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics inspired him.[46]\\r\\nSpiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s, both as cartoonist and editor.[47] In 1972 Justin Green produced the semi-autobiographical comic book Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary, which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work.[48] The same year, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip for the first issue of Funny Aminals  [sic], which Green edited.[47] Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism, and at first considered focusing on African Americans,[49] with cats as Ku Klux Klan members chasing African-American mice.[50] Instead, he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled \\"Maus\\". The tale was narrated to a mouse named \\"Mickey\\".[47] After finishing the strip, Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work, which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father's Auschwitz experience. His father gave him further background information, which piqued Spiegelman's interest. Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father, which was to provide the basis of the longer Maus.[51] Spiegelman followed up with extensive research, reading survivors' accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived. He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region.[52]\\r\\nIn 1973, Spiegelman produced a strip for Short Order Comix #1[53] about his mother's suicide called \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\\". The same year, he edited a pornographic, psychedelic book of quotations, and dedicated it to his mother.[38] He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short avant-garde comics. He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975, which he admitted to his father only in 1977, by which time he had decided to work on a \\"very long comic book\\".[15] He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978,[45] and visited Auschwitz in 1979.[54] He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called Raw.[55]\\r\\nAmerican comic books were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s,[56] but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s.[57] By the time Maus began serialization, the \\"Big Two\\" comics publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, dominated the industry with mostly superhero titles.[58] The underground comix movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund.[59] The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression.[60] Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium.[61]\\r\\nMaus came to prominence when the term \\"graphic novel\\" was beginning to gain currency. Will Eisner popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of A Contract with God. The term was used partly to mask the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term \\"comic book\\" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.[62]\\r\\nThe first chapter of Maus appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of Raw[46] as a small insert; a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991. Every chapter but the last appeared in Raw.[63]\\r\\nSpiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of Maus,[42] but after a rave New York Times review of the serial in August 1986, Pantheon Books published the first six chapters in a volume[64] called Maus: A Survivor's Tale and subtitled My Father Bleeds History. Spiegelman was relieved that the book's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film An American Tail by three months, as he believed that the film, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, was inspired by Maus and wished to avoid comparisons with it.[65]\\r\\nThe book found a large audience, partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the direct market comic shops where comic books were normally sold.[66] Maus was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it. Though Pantheon pushed for the term \\"graphic novel\\", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as \\"graphic novels\\" whether or not they had novelistic qualities. He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books.[62] Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with Drawn and Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the Book Industry Study Group in the early 2000s to include \\"graphic novel\\" as a category in bookstores.[67]\\r\\nPantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled And Here My Troubles Began. Pantheon later collected the two volumes into soft- and hardcover two-volume boxed sets and single-volume editions.[68] In 1994 the Voyager Company released The Complete Maus on CD-ROM, a collection which contained the original comics, Vladek's taped transcripts, filmed interviews, sketches, and other background material.[69] The CD-ROM was based on HyperCard, a Macintosh-only application that has since become obsolete.[70] In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to The Complete Maus entitled MetaMaus, with further background material, including filmed footage of Vladek.[42] The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by Hillary Chute. It also has interviews with Spiegelman's wife and children, sketches, photographs, family trees, assorted artwork, and a DVD with video, audio, photos, and an interactive version of Maus.[71]\\r\\nSpiegelman dedicated Maus to his brother Richieu and his first daughter Nadja.[72] The book's epigraph is a quote from Adolf Hitler: \\"The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human.\\"[73]\\r\\nPenguin Books obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986. In support of the African National Congress's cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to \\"compromise with fascism\\"[74] by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.[74]\\r\\nBy 2011, Maus had been translated into about thirty languages. Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated Franco-Belgian comics tradition; German, given the book's background; and Polish. Poland was the setting for most of the book and Polish was the language of his parents and his own mother tongue.[75] The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work's serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover, per laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism.[76] Reception in Germany was positiveMaus was a best-seller and was taught in schools. The Polish translation encountered difficulties; as early as 1987, when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland, the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles' depiction as pigs and pointed out how serious an insult it was. Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts.[75] Piotr Bikont, a journalist for Gazeta Wyborcza, set up his own publishing house to publish Maus in Polish in 2001. Demonstrators protested Maus's publication and burned the book in front of Gazeta's offices. Bikont's response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows.[77] The magazine-sized Japanese translation was the only authorized edition with larger pages.[78] Long-standing plans for an Arabic translation have yet to come to fruition.[50] A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of Maus from Russian bookstores leading up to Victory Day due to the swastika appearing on the book's cover.[76]\\r\\nA few panels were changed for the Hebrew edition of Maus. Based on Vladek's memory, Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi-installed Jewish Police. An Israeli descendant objected and threatened to sue for libel. Spiegelman redrew the character with a fedora in place of his original police hat, but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this \\"intrusion\\".[79] This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house Zmora Bitan. It had an indifferent or negative reception, and the publisher did not release the second volume.[80] Another Israeli publisher put out both volumes, with a new translation by poet Yehuda Vizan that included Vladek's broken language, which Zmora Bitan had refused to do.[81] Marilyn Reizbaum saw this as highlighting a difference between the self-image of the Israeli Jew as a fearless defender of the homeland, and that of the American Jew as a feeble victim,[82] something that one Israeli writer disparaged as \\"the diaspora sickness\\".[83][f]\\r\\nSpiegelman, like many of his critics, worries that \\"[r]eality is too much for comics?... so much has to be left out or distorted\\", admitting that his presentation of the story may not be accurate.[84] He takes a postmodern approach; Maus \\"feeds on itself\\", telling the story of how the story was made. It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to makefor example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.[85]\\r\\nThe book portrays humans with the heads and tails of different species of animals; Jews are drawn as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs,[2] among others. Spiegelman took advantage of the way Nazi propaganda films depicted Jews as vermin,[86] though he was first struck by the metaphor after attending a presentation where Ken Jacobs showed films of minstrel shows along with early American animated films, abundant with racial caricatures.[87] Spiegelman derived the mouse as symbol for the Jew from Nazi propaganda, emphasized in a quote from a German newspaper in the 1930s that prefaces the second volume: \\"Mickey Mouse is the most miserable idea ever revealed?... Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal?... Away with Jewish brutalization of the people! Down with Mickey Mouse! Wear the Swastika Cross!\\"[88]\\r\\nJewish characters try to pass themselves off as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back.[89] Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's\\"you could see she was more Jewish\\", Vladek says. Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise.[90] This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution may risk reinforcing racist labels,[91] but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters. According to art historian Andrea Liss, this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.[92]\\r\\nIn making people of each ethnicity look alike, Spiegelman hoped to show the absurdity of dividing people along such lines. Spiegelman has stated that \\"these metaphors?... are meant to self-destruct\\"[93] and \\"reveal the inanity of the notion itself\\".[94] Professor Amy Hungerford saw no consistent system to the animal metaphor.[95] Rather, it signified the characters' roles in the story rather than their racesthe gentile Fran?oise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims. When asked what animal he would make Israeli Jews, Spiegelman suggests porcupines.[88] When Art visits his psychiatrist, the two wear mouse masks.[96] Spiegelman's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book's makingin the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, but by the time the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask.[97] In Maus, the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator/prey relationship. In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans.[97] Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.[98]\\r\\nTo Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is \\"dominated by memories that are not his own\\".[99] His work is one not of memory but of postmemorya term she coined after encountering Maus. This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves. While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memoriesthe memory of another's memoryuntil the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right. The children's proximity creates a \\"deep personal connection\\" with the memory, though separated from it by \\"generational distance\\".[100]\\r\\nArt tried to keep his father's story chronological, because otherwise he would \\"never keep it straight\\".[101] His mother Anja's memories are conspicuously absent from the narrative, given her suicide and Vladek's destruction of her diaries. Hirsch sees Maus in part as an attempt to reconstruct her memory. Vladek keeps her memory alive with the pictures on his desk, \\"like a shrine\\", according to Mala.[102]\\r\\nSpiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways. He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to.[103] The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpsesthe corpses of the six million Jews upon whom Maus' success was built.[104] He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son,[105] and that some of Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way.[106] As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this \\"separate universe\\", and feels inadequate in portraying it.[27][107]\\r\\nSpiegelman parodies the Nazis' vision of racial divisions; Vladek's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Fran?oise would pick up a black hitchhiker, a \\"schwartser\\" as he says. When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, \\"It's not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!\\"[108] Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans.[109]\\r\\nThe Germans are depicted with little difference between them, but there is great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story.[110] Sometimes Jews and the Jewish councils are shown complying with the occupiers; some trick other Jews into capture, while others act as police for the Nazis.[111]\\r\\nSpiegelman shows numerous instances of Poles who risked themselves to aid Jews, and also shows antisemitism as being rife among them. The kapos who run the camps are Poles, and Anja and Vladek are tricked by Polish smugglers into the hands of the Nazis. Anja and Vladek hear stories that Poles continue to drive off and even kill returning Jews after the war.[112]\\r\\nVladek's English is broken in contrast with that of Art's more fluent therapist, Paul Pavel, who is also an immigrant and Holocaust survivor.[113] Vladek's knowledge of the language helps him several times during the story, as when he uses it to meet Anja. He also uses it to befriend a Frenchman, and continues to correspond with him in English after the war. His recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is never in his mother tongue,[114] and English becomes his daily language when he moves to America.[115] His difficulty with his second language is revealed as Art writes his dialogue in broken English;[116] when Vladek is imprisoned he tells Art, \\"[E]very day we prayed?... I was very religious, and it wasn't else to do\\".[117] Late in the book, Vladek talks of Dachau, saying, \\"And here?... my troubles began\\", though clearly his troubles had begun long before Dachau. This unidiomatic expression was used as the subtitle of the second volume.[116]\\r\\nThe German word Maus is cognate to the English word \\"mouse\\",[118] and also reminiscent of the German verb mauscheln, which means \\"to speak like a Jew\\"[119] and refers to the way Jews from Eastern Europe spoke German[120]a word not etymologically related to Maus, but distantly to Moses.[119]\\r\\nSpiegelman's perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics. The prevailing view in the English-speaking world held comics as inherently trivial,[121] thus degrading Spiegelman's subject matter, especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones.[122] Funny animals have been a staple of comics, and while they have a traditional reputation as children's fare, the underground had long made use of them in adult stories,[123] for example in Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat, which comics critic Joseph Witek asserts shows that the genre could \\"open up the way to a paradoxical narrative realism\\" that Maus exploited.[124]\\r\\nOstensibly about the Holocaust, the story entwines with the frame tale of Art interviewing and interacting with his father. Art's \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\\" is also encompassed by the frame, and stands in visual and thematical contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form[53] in a surreal, German Expressionist woodcut style inspired by Lynd Ward.[125]\\r\\nSpiegelman blurs the line between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what Maus is becoming for him, he says to his wife, \\"In real life you'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting.\\"[126] When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse.[127] Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which \\"helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities\\".[5]\\r\\nSpiegelman started taking down his interviews with Vladek on paper, but quickly switched to a tape recorder,[128] face-to-face or over the phone.[52] Spiegelman often condensed Vladek's words, and occasionally added to the dialogue[128] or synthesized multiple retellings into a single portrayal.[52]\\r\\nSpiegelman worried about the effect that his organizing of Vladek's story would have on its authenticity. In the end, he eschewed a Joycean approach and settled on a linear narrative he thought would be better at \\"getting things across\\".[52] He strove to present how the book was recorded and organized as an integral part of the book itself, expressing the \\"sense of an interview shaped by a relationship\\".[52]\\r\\nThe story is text-driven, with few wordless panels[4] in its 1,500 black-and-white panels.[129] The art has high contrast, with heavy black areas and thick black borders balanced against areas of white and wide white margins. There is little gray in the shading.[130] In the narrative present, the pages are arranged in eight-panel grids; in the narrative past, Spiegelman found himself \\"violating the grid constantly\\" with his page layouts.[32]\\r\\nSpiegelman rendered the original three-page \\"Maus\\" and \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\\" in highly detailed, expressive styles. Spiegelman planned to draw Maus in such a manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies.[37] Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original \\"Maus\\", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, \\"tells you how to feel, tells you how to think\\".[131] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments.[132] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions.[89] The contrast between the artwork in \\"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\\" and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork\\"Prisoner\\" is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.[40]\\r\\nSpiegelman wanted the artwork to have a diary feel to it, and so drew the pages on stationery with a fountain pen and typewriter correction fluid. It was reproduced at the same size it was drawn, unlike his other work, which was usually drawn larger and shrunk down, which hides defects in the art.[50]\\r\\nSpiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium's history. Chief among his early influences were Harvey Kurtzman, Will Eisner,[133] and Bernard Krigstein's \\"Master Race\\".[134] Though he acknowledged Eisner's early work as an influence, he denied that Eisner's first graphic novel, A Contract with God (1978), had any impact on Maus.[135] He cited Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan Annie as having \\"influenced Maus fairly directly\\", and praised Gray's work for using a cartoon-based storytelling vocabulary, rather than an illustration-based one.[136] Justin Green's Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary (1972) inspired Spiegelman to include autobiographical elements in his comics. Spiegelman stated, \\"without Binky Brown, there would be no Maus\\".[48] Among the graphic artists who influenced Maus, Spiegelman cited Frans Masereel, who had made early wordless novels in woodcuts such as Passionate Journey (1919).[46]\\r\\nSpiegelman's work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community, but the media attention after the first volume's publication in 1986 was unexpected.[137] Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and Maus became the center of new attention focused on comics.[138] It was considered one of the \\"Big Three\\" book-form comics from around 1986ÿ1987, along with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, that are said to have brought the term \\"graphic novel\\" and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness.[139] It was credited with changing the public's perception of what comics could be[140] at a time when, in the English-speaking world, they were considered to be for children, and strongly associated with superheroes.[59] Initially, critics of Maus showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse.[141] The New York Times intended praise when saying of the book, \\"Art Spiegelman doesn't draw comic books\\".[142] After its Pulitzer Prize win, it won greater acceptance and interest among academics.[143] The Museum of Modern Art staged an exhibition on the making of Maus in 1991ÿ92.[144]\\r\\nMaus proved difficult to classify to a genre,[145] and has been called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir.[146] Spiegelman petitioned The New York Times to move it from \\"fiction\\" to \\"non-fiction\\" on the newspaper's bestseller list,[126] saying, \\"I shudder to think how David Duke?... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father's memories of life in Hitler's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction\\". An editor responded, \\"Let's go out to Spiegelman's house and if a giant mouse answers the door, we'll move it to the nonfiction side of the list!\\" The Times eventually acquiesced.[147] The Pulitzer committee sidestepped the issue by giving the completed Maus a Special Award in Letters in 1992.[148]\\r\\nMaus ranked highly on comics and literature lists. The Comics Journal called it the fourth greatest comics work of the 20th century,[4] and Wizard placed it first on their list of 100 Greatest Graphic Novels.[149] Entertainment Weekly listed Maus at seventh place on their list of The New Classics: Books ÿ The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008,[150] and Time put Maus at seventh place on their list of best non-fiction books from between 1923 and 2005,[151] and fourth on their list of top graphic novels.[152] Praise for the book also came from contemporaries such as Jules Feiffer and literary writers such as Umberto Eco.[153] Spiegelman turned down numerous offers to have Maus adapted for film or television.[154]\\r\\nEarly instalments of Maus that appeared in Raw inspired the young Chris Ware to \\"try to do comics that had a 'serious' tone to them\\".[155] Maus is cited as a primary influence on graphic novels such as Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis and Alison Bechdel's Fun Home.[48]\\r\\nIn 1999, cartoonist Ted Rall had an article published in The Village Voice criticizing Spiegelman's prominence and influence in the New York cartooning community.[156] Entitled \\"King Maus: Art Spiegelman Rules the World of Comix With Favors and Fear\\", it accused the Pulitzer board of opportunism in selecting Maus, which Rall deemed unworthy.[157] Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded to the piece with a prank email in which Hellman posed as Rall,[156] soliciting discussion at the email address TedRallsBalls@onelist.com. Hellman followed up by posting fake responses from New York magazine editors and art directors. Rall launched a lawsuit seeking damages of $1.5 million for libel, breach of privacy, and causing emotional distress.[158] To raise funds to fight the suit, in 2001 Hellman had the Legal Action Comics anthology published, which included a back cover by Spiegelman in which he depicts Rall as a urinal.[156]\\r\\nA cottage industry of academic research has built up around Maus,[159] and schools have frequently used it as course material in a range of fields: history, dysfunctional family psychology,[2] language arts, and social studies.[160] The volume of academic work published on Maus far surpasses that of any other work of comics.[161] One of the earliest such works was Joshua Brown's 1988 \\"Of Mice and Memory\\" from the Oral History Review, which deals with the problems Spiegelman faced in presenting his father's story. Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory called \\"Family Pictures: Maus, Mourning, and Post-Memory\\", later expanded into a book called Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory. Academics far outside the field of comics such as Dominick LaCapra, Linda Hutcheon, and Terrence Des Pres took part in the discourse. Few approached Maus who were familiar with comics, largely because of the lack of an academic comics traditionMaus tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective. In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on Maus called Considering Maus: Approaches to Art Spiegelman's \\"Survivor's Tale\\" of the Holocaust.[133] Maus is considered an important work of Holocaust literature, and studies of it have made significant contributions to Holocaust studies.[162]\\r\\nAccording to writer Arie Kaplan, some Holocaust survivors objected to Spiegelman making a comic book out of their tragedy.[163] Literary critics such as Hillel Halkin objected that the animal metaphor was \\"doubly dehumanizing\\", reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another, when they were actually done by humans against humans.[164] Comics writer and critic Harvey Pekar and others[165] saw Spiegelman's use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes.[166] Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father,[167] calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective.[168] Comics critic R.?C. Harvey argued that Spiegelman's animal metaphor threatened \\"to erode [Maus's] moral underpinnings\\",[169] and played \\"directly into [the Nazis'] racist vision\\".[170]\\r\\nCommentators such as Peter Obst and Lawrence Weschler expressed concern over the Poles' depiction as pigs,[171] which reviewer Marek Kohn saw as an ethnic slur[172] and The Norton Anthology of American Literature called \\"a calculated insult\\".[173] Jewish culture views pigs and pork as non-kosher, or uncleana point of which the Jewish Spiegelman was unlikely to be ignorant.[171] Critics such as Obst and Pekar have said that the portrayal of Poles is unbalancedthat, while some Poles are seen as helping Jews, they are often shown doing so for self-serving reasons.[174] In the late 1990s, an objector to Maus's depiction of Poles interrupted a presentation by Spiegelman at Montreal's McGill University with persistent abuse and was expelled from the auditorium.[175]\\r\\nLiterary critic Walter Ben Michaels found Spiegelman's racial divisions \\"counterfactual\\".[176] Spiegelman depicts Europeans as different animal species based on Nazi conceptions of race, but all Americans, both black and white, as dogswith the exception of the Jews, who remain unassimilated mice. To Michaels, Maus seems to gloss over the racial inequality that has plagued the history of the U.S.[176]\\r\\nOther critics, such as Bart Beaty, objected to what they saw as the work's fatalism.[177]\\r\\nScholar Paul Buhle asserted, \\"More than a few readers have described [Maus] as the most compelling of any [Holocaust] depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason.\\"[178] Michael Rothberg opined, \\"By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated, unreal, 'comic' space, Spiegelman captures the hyperintensity of Auschwitz.\\"[179]\\r\\nBelgian publisher La Cinquime Couche[180] anonymously produced a book called Katz, a remix of Spiegelman's book with all animal heads replaced with cat heads. The book reproduced every page and line of dialogue from the French translation of Maus. Spiegelman's French publisher, Flammarion, had the Belgian publisher destroy all copies under charges of copyright violation.[177]","input":"How many books are in the maus series?"},{"output":"Sears Tower","context":"This list of the tallest buildings in the United States includes all buildings of 700?ft (213?m) or higher by architectural height, excluding antennas.

Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers. New York City, specifically the borough of Manhattan, notably has the tallest skyline in the country. Eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world (9 in New York City).[1] New York City and Chicago have always been the centers of American skyscraper building.

He has also coached the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos, with whom he won an NFC Championship and an AFC Championship, respectively, but lost both of his coaching appearances in the Super Bowl.\\r\\nIn the 2013 NFL season, quarterback Peyton Manning threw for 5,477 yards and 55 touchdowns, both records, and the offense combined for 7,317 yards, also a record. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, the Broncos finished tied for 3rd in the NFL in sacks and 1st in rushing offense, again with Fox.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFox played football at Castle Park High School in Chula Vista, California under local celebrated coaches Gil Warren and Reldon \\"Bing\\" Dawson, and Southwestern College (California) also in Chula Vista from 1974ÿ1975, before going to San Diego State, where he played defensive back with future NFL player and head coach Herman Edwards. Fox received a bachelor's degree in physical education and earned teaching credentials from San Diego State. He then proceeded to the NFL as a free agent and signed a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After that contract was over he retired from the NFL.\\r\\nFox was a great defensive backs coach at U.S. International University.[2] Sid Gillman, past head coach of the San Diego Chargers, was the athletic director at the time. In 1980, Fox was the defensive backs coach for the Boise State University Broncos when they won the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. In 1983, Fox was a member of Mike Gottfried's University of Kansas staff, as the secondary coach. Fox followed Gottfried to the University of Pittsburgh when Gottfried became Head Coach at Pitt in 1986. Fox was first the Defensive Backs coach and then was promoted to Defensive Coordinator by Gottfried. While at Pitt, Fox made some contacts with Pittsburgh Steeler coaches and when Gottfried was let go by Pitt, Fox got his first NFL coaching gig with the Steelers.\\r\\nFox began his first professional football coaching stint in the short-lived United States Football League with the Los Angeles Express in 1985.\\r\\nHe entered the NFL in 1989 as the secondary coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, later also holding this job with the San Diego Chargers. Fox was the defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Raiders and later that of the New York Giants during Super Bowl XXXV, which they lost.\\r\\nIn 2002, Fox was signed as the third head coach of the Carolina Panthers, whose previous coach George Seifert had led the team to a disastrous 1-15 record in 2001. Fox's first regular season game was a 10ÿ7 victory over the Baltimore Ravens which ended the Panthers' 15-game losing streak dating to the previous season. Fox and the Panthers posted a 7ÿ9 record for the 2002 season (his first with the team), demonstrating a drastic improvement over the previous season.\\r\\nIn the 2003 season Fox led the Panthers to Super Bowl XXXVIII, losing 32ÿ29 to the New England Patriots on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri. Fox joined Vince Lombardi as the only other coach to inherit a team that had won only one game in the season prior, and then take that team to a NFL Championship game. Fox also took the Carolina Panthers to the NFC Championship game in the 2005 season, but they were defeated by the Seattle Seahawks.\\r\\nThe 2006 season was disappointing for Fox and the Panthers, as a team that had Super Bowl aspirations finished 8-8 and out of the playoffs.\\r\\nThe 2007 season saw the team finish with a record of 7ÿ9, before finishing with a 12ÿ4 record in the 2008 season, again heading to the playoffs in which they were routed by the Arizona Cardinals.\\r\\nThe 2009 season was disappointing to Fox and the Panthers much like 2006. The Panthers finished the season 8-8 and in third place in the NFC South division, missing the playoffs again.\\r\\nThe 2010 season saw the Panthers finish last in the league, at 2ÿ14.\\r\\nOn December 31, 2010, Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson announced that he would not be renewing Fox's contract at the conclusion of the 2010 season.[3]\\r\\nOn January 13, 2011, Fox was selected to be the 14th head coach of the Denver Broncos. He was signed to a 4-year $14 million deal. He was chosen by the Broncos out of a list of five possible head coach candidates that included Broncos interim head coach and running backs coach Eric Studesville, Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter, Houston Texans offensive coordinator Rick Dennison and New York Giants defensive coordinator Perry Fewell. Fox was chosen based on his previous head coaching experience plus his 20+ years as an NFL coach.[4]\\r\\nFox is one of only two coaches, and the only one as a head coach, still working on the NFL sidelines that was once a member of former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Chuck Noll's coaching staff, the other being current Minnesota Vikings wide receivers coach George Stewart.[5] Tom Moore, currently an offensive consultant for the Arizona Cardinals, is still active in the league but works from home.\\r\\nIn April 2012, Fox received a three-year contract extension worth between $5 million and $6 million per year, replacing his contract that expired at the end of the 2014 NFL season.[6]\\r\\nIn week two of the 2012 season, Fox was fined $30,000 for chiding the replacement officials.[7] The Broncos would go on to win their last 11 games after a 2ÿ3 start. In week 17 of the 2012 season, Fox won his 100th career game as an NFL head coach, including the playoffs, beating the Kansas City Chiefs 38ÿ3. However, the Broncos were upset in the divisional playoffs to the Baltimore Ravens, in overtime.\\r\\nDue to a cardiac related issue, starting with week 10 of 2013, Fox was replaced by Broncos defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio, as Fox underwent an aortic valve replacement.[8] Fox, while playing golf in North Carolina near his offseason home in Charlotte during the Broncos bye week, reported feeling dizzy and was taken to the hospital for examination where doctors told him not to put off valve replacement surgery any longer; he had done so earlier in the year to continue coaching this season.[9] On November 4, Fox temporarily relinquished his head coaching duties, and Del Rio was named interim head coach for the remainder of the 2013 season regular season. Fox then underwent successful aortic valve replacement surgery.[10]\\r\\nHe coached the Broncos to Super Bowl XLVIII in the 2013 season, where they played the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks. He is one of only two head coaches to win both an NFC and an AFC championship game along with Dan Reeves, and one of six coaches to reach the Super Bowl with multiple teams.[11] On February 2, 2014, the Broncos lost to the Seahawks 43-8.\\r\\nFox coached the Broncos to another strong season in 2014; the Broncos finished the regular season 12ÿ4. They earned the AFC's number 2 seed and a first-round playoff bye. Hosting the Indianapolis Colts at home in the Divisional Round, the Broncos were upset 24ÿ13 and were eliminated from the playoffs.\\r\\nOn January 12, 2015, the day after Denver lost in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, Fox and the Broncos mutually agreed to part ways. Fox left the Broncos with the highest regular season win percentage in team history. However, general manager John Elway felt the Broncos hadn't shown enough fight at critical times in the playoffs.[12]\\r\\nFox is only the second head coach in NFL history to win four straight division titles since joining a new team.\\r\\nOn January 16, 2015, Fox accepted a four-year deal to become head coach of the Chicago Bears.[13] Fox led the Bears to a 6ÿ10 record in his first season, only the second time in his career where he had double-digit losses. However, Fox finished his second season with the Bears with a 3-13 record, not only his second-worst record as a coach and the third time he finished a season with double-digit losses, but tied for the worst record for the Bears since the NFL change to a 16-game season.\\r\\nFox was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia and raised in San Diego, California after moving there at age 15. His step-father, Ron, was a US Navy SEAL. Fox and his wife, Robin, have three sons (Matthew, Mark, and Cody) and a daughter (Halle). Known to his friends as \\"Foxy\\", he is an active community leader in the Carolinas. He and his wife co-chair the annual Angels & Stars Gala, which benefits St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.[14]\\r\\nNFL head coaches under whom Fox has served:\\r\\nAssistant coaches under Fox who became NFL head coaches:\\r\\nPound sign (#) denotes interim head coach.","input":"Who did john fox coach before the bears?"},{"output":"Maxwell","context":"In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space time, carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. [1] It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.[2]\\"\\r\\nClassically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum. The oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. The wavefront of electromagnetic waves emitted from a point source (such as a lightbulb) is a sphere. The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum could be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength. The electromagnetic spectrum includes, in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.[3]\\r\\nElectromagnetic waves are produced whenever charged particles are accelerated, and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles. EM waves carry energy, momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact. Quanta of EM waves are called photons, whose mass is zero. Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (\\"radiate\\") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field. In this language, the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically, electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena.\\r\\nIn the quantum theory of electromagnetism,[4] EMR consists of photons, the elementary particles responsible for all electromagnetic interactions.[5] Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation. The energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons of higher frequency. This relationship is given by Planck's equation E = h, where E is the energy per photon,  is the frequency of the photon, and h is Planck's constant. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry ~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.\\r\\nThe effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's power and its frequency. EMR of visible or lower frequencies (i.e., visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is called non-ionizing radiation, because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules. The effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are called ionizing radiation since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds. These radiations have the ability to cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating, and can be a health hazard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaxwell derived a wave form of the electric and magnetic equations, thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields and their symmetry. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured speed of light, Maxwell concluded that light itself is an EM wave.[6][7][8] Maxwells equations were confirmed by Heinrich Hertz through experiments with radio waves.\\r\\nAccording to Maxwell's equations, a spatially varying electric field is always associated with a magnetic field that changes over time.[9]Likewise, a spatially varying magnetic field is associated with specific changes over time in the electric field. In an electromagnetic wave, the changes in the electric field are always accompanied by a wave in the magnetic field in one direction, and vice versa. This relationship between the two occurs without either type field causing the other; rather, they occur together in the same way that time and space changes occur together and are interlinked in special relativity. In fact, magnetic fields may be viewed as relativistic distortions of electric fields, so the close relationship between space and time changes here is more than an analogy. Together, these fields form a propagating electromagnetic wave, which moves out into space and need never again affect the source. The distant EM field formed in this way by the acceleration of a charge carries energy with it that \\"radiates\\" away through space, hence the term.\\r\\nMaxwell's equations established that some charges and currents (\\"sources\\") produce a local type of electromagnetic field near them that does not have the behaviour of EMR. Currents directly produce a magnetic field, but it is of a magnetic dipole type that dies out with distance from the current. In a similar manner, moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing electrical potential (such as in an antenna) produce an electric dipole type electrical field, but this also declines with distance. These fields make up the near-field near the EMR source. Neither of these behaviours are responsible for EM radiation. Instead, they cause electromagnetic field behaviour that only efficiently transfers power to a receiver very close to the source, such as the magnetic induction inside a transformer, or the feedback behaviour that happens close to the coil of a metal detector. Typically, near-fields have a powerful effect on their own sources, causing an increased load (decreased electrical reactance) in the source or transmitter, whenever energy is withdrawn from the EM field by a receiver. Otherwise, these fields do not propagate freely out into space, carrying their energy away without distance-limit, but rather oscillate, returning their energy to the transmitter if it is not received by a receiver.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy contrast, the EM far-field is composed of radiation that is free of the transmitter in the sense that (unlike the case in an electrical transformer) the transmitter requires the same power to send these changes in the fields out, whether the signal is immediately picked up or not. This distant part of the electromagnetic field is \\"electromagnetic radiation\\" (also called the far-field). The far-fields propagate (radiate) without allowing the transmitter to affect them. This causes them to be independent in the sense that their existence and their energy, after they have left the transmitter, is completely independent of both transmitter and receiver. Due to conservation of energy the amount of power passing through any spherical surface drawn around the source is the same. Because such a surface has an area proportional to the square of its distance from the source, the power density of EM radiation always decreases with the inverse square of distance from the source; this is called the inverse-square law. This is in contrast to dipole parts of the EM field close to the source (the near-field), which varies in power according to an inverse cube power law, and thus does not transport a conserved amount of energy over distances, but instead fades with distance, with its energy (as noted) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a nearby receiver (such as a transformer secondary coil).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe far-field (EMR) depends on a different mechanism for its production than the near-field, and upon different terms in Maxwells equations. Whereas the magnetic part of the near-field is due to currents in the source, the magnetic field in EMR is due only to the local change in the electric field. In a similar way, while the electric field in the near-field is due directly to the charges and charge-separation in the source, the electric field in EMR is due to a change in the local magnetic field. Both processes for producing electric and magnetic EMR fields have a different dependence on distance than do near-field dipole electric and magnetic fields. That is why the EMR type of EM field becomes dominant in power far from sources. The term far from sources refers to how far from the source (moving at the speed of light) any portion of the outward-moving EM field is located, by the time that source currents are changed by the varying source potential, and the source has therefore begun to generate an outwardly moving EM field of a different phase.[citation needed]\\r\\nA more compact view of EMR is that the far-field that composes EMR is generally that part of the EM field that has traveled sufficient distance from the source, that it has become completely disconnected from any feedback to the charges and currents that were originally responsible for it. Now independent of the source charges, the EM field, as it moves farther away, is dependent only upon the accelerations of the charges that produced it. It no longer has a strong connection to the direct fields of the charges, or to the velocity of the charges (currents).[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the LinardÿWiechert potential formulation of the electric and magnetic fields due to motion of a single particle (according to Maxwell's equations), the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, the term associated with the changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that results from the particle's uniform velocity, are both associated with the electromagnetic near-field, and do not comprise EM radiation.[citation needed]\\r\\nElectrodynamics is the physics of electromagnetic radiation, and electromagnetism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are vector fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition.[10] For example, in optics two or more coherent lightwaves may interact and by constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual lightwaves.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince light is an oscillation it is not affected by traveling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum. However, in nonlinear media, such as some crystals, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields  these interactions include the Faraday effect and the Kerr effect.[11][12]\\r\\nIn refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different density alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by Snell's law. Light of composite wavelengths (natural sunlight) disperses into a visible spectrum passing through a prism, because of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of the prism material (dispersion); that is, each component wave within the composite light is bent a different amount.[citation needed]\\r\\nEM radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the same time (see wave-particle duality). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. It is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy when light is absorbed, however this alone is not evidence of \\"particulate\\" behavior. Rather, it reflects the quantum nature of matter.[13] Demonstrating that the light itself is quantized, not merely its interaction with matter, is a more subtle affair.\\r\\nSome experiments display both the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves, such as the self-interference of a single photon.[14] When a single photon is sent through an interferometer, it passes through both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a photomultiplier or other sensitive detector only once.\\r\\nA quantum theory of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics.\\r\\nElectromagnetic waves can be polarized, reflected, refracted, diffracted or interfere with each other.[15][16][17]\\r\\nElectromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave, meaning that its oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer and travel.[18] The electric and magnetic parts of the field stand in a fixed ratio of strengths in order to satisfy the two Maxwell equations that specify how one is produced from the other. These E and B fields are also in phase, with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space (see illustrations). A common misconception is that the E and B fields in electromagnetic radiation are out of phase because a change in one produces the other, and this would produce a phase difference between them as sinusoidal functions (as indeed happens in electromagnetic induction, and in the near-field close to antennas). However, in the far-field EM radiation which is described by the two source-free Maxwell curl operator equations, a more correct description is that a time-change in one type of field is proportional to a space-change in the other. These derivatives require that the E and B fields in EMR are in-phase (see math section below).[citation needed]\\r\\nAn important aspect of light's nature is its frequency. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in hertz, the SI unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per second. Light usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction, a phenomenon known as dispersion.\\r\\nA wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the wavelength. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:[citation needed]\\r\\nwhere v is the speed of the wave (c in a vacuum, or less in other media), f is the frequency and  is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.\\r\\nElectromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of Maxwell's electromagnetic wave equation. Two main classes of solutions are known, namely plane waves and spherical waves. The plane waves may be viewed as the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large (ideally infinite) distance from the source. Both types of waves can have a waveform which is an arbitrary time function (so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to conform to the wave equation). As with any time function, this can be decomposed by means of Fourier analysis into its frequency spectrum, or individual sinusoidal components, each of which contains a single frequency, amplitude and phase. Such a component wave is said to be monochromatic. A monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by its frequency or wavelength, its peak amplitude, its phase relative to some reference phase, its direction of propagation and its polarization.\\r\\nInterference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference. An example of interference caused by EMR is electromagnetic interference (EMI) or as it is more commonly known as, radio-frequency interference (RFI).[citation needed] Additionally, multiple polarization signals can be combined (i.e. interfered) to form new states of polarization, which is known as parallel polarization state generation.[19]\\r\\nThe energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called radiant energy.[20][21][22][citation needed]\\r\\nAn anomaly arose in the late 19th century involving a contradiction between the wave theory of light and measurements of the electromagnetic spectra that were being emitted by thermal radiators known as black bodies. Physicists struggled with this problem, which later became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe, unsuccessfully for many years. In 1900, Max Planck developed a new theory of black-body radiation that explained the observed spectrum. Planck's theory was based on the idea that black bodies emit light (and other electromagnetic radiation) only as discrete bundles or packets of energy. These packets were called quanta. Later, Albert Einstein proposed that light quanta be regarded as real particles. Later the particle of light was given the name photon, to correspond with other particles being described around this time, such as the electron and proton. A photon has an energy, E, proportional to its frequency, f, by\\r\\nwhere h is Planck's constant, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda }\\r\\n\\r\\n is the wavelength and c is the speed of light. This is sometimes known as the PlanckÿEinstein equation.[23] In quantum theory (see first quantization) the energy of the photons is thus directly proportional to the frequency of the EMR wave.[24]\\r\\nLikewise, the momentum p of a photon is also proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength:\\r\\nThe source of Einstein's proposal that light was composed of particles (or could act as particles in some circumstances) was an experimental anomaly not explained by the wave theory: the photoelectric effect, in which light striking a metal surface ejected electrons from the surface, causing an electric current to flow across an applied voltage. Experimental measurements demonstrated that the energy of individual ejected electrons was proportional to the frequency, rather than the intensity, of the light. Furthermore, below a certain minimum frequency, which depended on the particular metal, no current would flow regardless of the intensity. These observations appeared to contradict the wave theory, and for years physicists tried in vain to find an explanation. In 1905, Einstein explained this puzzle by resurrecting the particle theory of light to explain the observed effect. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, however, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism among established physicists. Eventually Einstein's explanation was accepted as new particle-like behavior of light was observed, such as the Compton effect.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a photon is absorbed by an atom, it excites the atom, elevating an electron to a higher energy level (one that is on average farther from the nucleus). When an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a lower energy level, it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies. Immediate photon emission is called fluorescence, a type of photoluminescence. An example is visible light emitted from fluorescent paints, in response to ultraviolet (blacklight). Many other fluorescent emissions are known in spectral bands other than visible light. Delayed emission is called phosphorescence.[25][26][citation needed]\\r\\nThe modern theory that explains the nature of light includes the motion of waveÿparticle duality. More generally, the theory states that everything has both a particle nature and a wave nature, and various experiments can be done to bring out one or the other. The particle nature is more easily discerned using an object with a large mass. A bold proposition by Louis de Broglie in 1924 led the scientific community to realize that electrons also exhibited waveÿparticle duality.[27]\\r\\nTogether, wave and particle effects fully explain the emission and absorption spectra of EM radiation. The matter-composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption and emission spectrum. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. Dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in an intervening medium between source and observer. The atoms absorb certain frequencies of the light between emitter and detector/eye, then emit them in all directions. A dark band appears to the detector, due to the radiation scattered out of the beam. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant star are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. A similar phenomenon occurs for emission, which is seen when an emitting gas glows due to excitation of the atoms from any mechanism, including heat. As electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons, but lines are seen because again emission happens only at particular energies after excitation.[28] An example is the emission spectrum of nebulae.[citation needed] Rapidly moving electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of force, so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation observed in nature.\\r\\nThese phenomena can aid various chemical determinations for the composition of gases lit from behind (absorption spectra) and for glowing gases (emission spectra). Spectroscopy (for example) determines what chemical elements comprise a particular star. Spectroscopy is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the red shift.[29]\\r\\nAny electric charge that accelerates, or any changing magnetic field, produces electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic information about the charge travels at the speed of light. Accurate treatment thus incorporates a concept known as retarded time, which adds to the expressions for the electrodynamic electric field and magnetic field. These extra terms are responsible for electromagnetic radiation.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen any wire (or other conducting object such as an antenna) conducts alternating current, electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the current. In many such situations it is possible to identify an electrical dipole moment that arises from separation of charges due to the exciting electrical potential, and this dipole moment oscillates in time, as the charges move back and forth. This oscillation at a given frequency gives rise to changing electric and magnetic fields, which then set the electromagnetic radiation in motion.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the quantum level, electromagnetic radiation is produced when the wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates. Charged particles in a stationary state do not move, but a superposition of such states may result in a transition state that has an electric dipole moment that oscillates in time. This oscillating dipole moment is responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum states of a charged particle. Such states occur (for example) in atoms when photons are radiated as the atom shifts from one stationary state to another.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a wave, light is characterized by a velocity (the speed of light), wavelength, and frequency. As particles, light is a stream of photons. Each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by Planck's relation E = hf, where E is the energy of the photon, h = 6.626 G 10?34 J{s is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the wave.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne rule is obeyed regardless of circumstances: EM radiation in a vacuum travels at the speed of light, relative to the observer, regardless of the observer's velocity. (This observation led to Einstein's development of the theory of special relativity.)[citation needed]\\r\\nIn a medium (other than vacuum), velocity factor or refractive index are considered, depending on frequency and application. Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy the late nineteenth century, various experimental anomalies could not be explained by the simple wave theory. One of these anomalies involved a controversy over the speed of light. The speed of light and other EMR predicted by Maxwell's equations did not appear unless the equations were modified in a way first suggested by FitzGerald and Lorentz (see history of special relativity), or else otherwise that speed would depend on the speed of observer relative to the \\"medium\\" (called luminiferous aether) which supposedly \\"carried\\" the electromagnetic wave (in a manner analogous to the way air carries sound waves). Experiments failed to find any observer effect. In 1905, Einstein proposed that space and time appeared to be velocity-changeable entities for light propagation and all other processes and laws. These changes accounted for the constancy of the speed of light and all electromagnetic radiation, from the viewpoints of all observerseven those in relative motion.\\r\\nElectromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer William Herschel, who published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London.[30] Herschel used a glass prism to refract light from the Sun and detected invisible rays that caused heating beyond the red part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded with a thermometer. These \\"calorific rays\\" were later termed infrared.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1801, German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter discovered ultraviolet in an experiment similar to Hershel's, using sunlight and a glass prism. Ritter noted that invisible rays near the violet edge of a solar spectrum dispersed by a triangular prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than did the nearby violet light. Ritter's experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the ultraviolet rays (which at first were called \\"chemical rays\\") were capable of causing chemical reactions.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1862-4 James Clerk Maxwell developed equations for the electromagnetic field which suggested that waves in the field would travel with a speed that was very close to the known speed of light. Maxwell therefore suggested that visible light (as well as invisible infrared and ultraviolet rays by inference) all consisted of propagating disturbances (or radiation) in the electromagnetic field. Radio waves were first produced deliberately by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations at a much lower frequency than that of visible light, following recipes for producing oscillating charges and currents suggested by Maxwell's equations. Hertz also developed ways to detect these waves, and produced and characterized what were later termed radio waves and microwaves.[31]:286,7\\r\\nWilhelm R?ntgen discovered and named X-rays. After experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. In one month, he discovered X-rays' main properties.[31]:307\\r\\nThe last portion of the EM spectrum to be discovered was associated with radioactivity. Henri Becquerel found that uranium salts caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate through a covering paper in a manner similar to X-rays, and Marie Curie discovered that only certain elements gave off these rays of energy, soon discovering the intense radiation of radium. The radiation from pitchblende was differentiated into alpha rays (alpha particles) and beta rays (beta particles) by Ernest Rutherford through simple experimentation in 1899, but these proved to be charged particulate types of radiation. However, in 1900 the French scientist Paul Villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford named gamma rays. In 1910 British physicist William Henry Bragg demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914 Rutherford and Edward Andrade measured their wavelengths, finding that they were similar to X-rays but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequency, although a 'cross-over' between X and gamma rays makes it possible to have X-rays with a higher energy (and hence shorter wavelength) than gamma rays and vice versa. The origin of the ray differentiates them, gamma rays tend to be a natural phenomena originating from the unstable nucleus of an atom and X-rays are electrically generated (and hence man-made) unless they are as a result of bremsstrahlung X-radiation caused by the interaction of fast moving particles (such as beta particles) colliding with certain materials, usually of higher atomic numbers.[31]:308,9\\r\\nEM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and magnetic and near fields) is classified by wavelength into radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can be expressed by Fourier analysis in terms of sinusoidal monochromatic waves, which in turn can each be classified into these regions of the EMR spectrum.\\r\\nFor certain classes of EM waves, the waveform is most usefully treated as random, and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different mathematical techniques appropriate to random or stochastic processes. In such cases, the individual frequency components are represented in terms of their power content, and the phase information is not preserved. Such a representation is called the power spectral density of the random process. Random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is, for example, encountered in the interior of stars, and in certain other very wideband forms of radiation such as the Zero point wave field of the electromagnetic vacuum.\\r\\nThe behavior of EM radiation depends on its frequency. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, and higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and are associated with photons of higher energy. There is no fundamental limit known to these wavelengths or energies, at either end of the spectrum, although photons with energies near the Planck energy or exceeding it (far too high to have ever been observed) will require new physical theories to describe.\\r\\nSoundwaves are not electromagnetic radiation. At the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 20?Hz to about 20?kHz, are frequencies that might be considered in the audio range. However, electromagnetic waves cannot be directly perceived by human ears. Sound waves are instead the oscillating compression of molecules. To be heard, electromagnetic radiation must be converted to pressure waves of the fluid in which the ear is located (whether the fluid is air, water or something else).\\r\\nWhen EM radiation interacts with matter, its behavior changes qualitatively as its frequency changes.\\r\\nAt radio and microwave frequencies, EMR interacts with matter largely as a bulk collection of charges which are spread out over large numbers of affected atoms. In electrical conductors, such induced bulk movement of charges (electric currents) results in absorption of the EMR, or else separations of charges that cause generation of new EMR (effective reflection of the EMR). An example is absorption or emission of radio waves by antennas, or absorption of microwaves by water or other molecules with an electric dipole moment, as for example inside a microwave oven. These interactions produce either electric currents or heat, or both.\\r\\nLike radio and microwave, infrared also is reflected by metals (as is most EMR into the ultraviolet). However, unlike lower-frequency radio and microwave radiation, Infrared EMR commonly interacts with dipoles present in single molecules, which change as atoms vibrate at the ends of a single chemical bond. It is consequently absorbed by a wide range of substances, causing them to increase in temperature as the vibrations dissipate as heat. The same process, run in reverse, causes bulk substances to radiate in the infrared spontaneously (see thermal radiation section below).\\r\\nAs frequency increases into the visible range, photons have enough energy to change the bond structure of some individual molecules. It is not a coincidence that this happens in the \\"visible range,\\" as the mechanism of vision involves the change in bonding of a single molecule (retinal) which absorbs light in the rhodopsin in the retina of the human eye. Photosynthesis becomes possible in this range as well, for similar reasons, as a single molecule of chlorophyll is excited by a single photon. Animals that detect infrared make use of small packets of water that change temperature, in an essentially thermal process that involves many photons (see infrared sensing in snakes). For this reason, infrared, microwaves and radio waves are thought to damage molecules and biological tissue only by bulk heating, not excitation from single photons of the radiation.\\r\\nVisible light is able to affect a few molecules with single photons, but usually not in a permanent or damaging way, in the absence of power high enough to increase temperature to damaging levels. However, in plant tissues that conduct photosynthesis, carotenoids act to quench electronically excited chlorophyll produced by visible light in a process called non-photochemical quenching, in order to prevent reactions that would otherwise interfere with photosynthesis at high light levels. Limited evidence indicate that some reactive oxygen species are created by visible light in skin, and that these may have some role in photoaging, in the same manner as ultraviolet A.[32]\\r\\nAs frequency increases into the ultraviolet, photons now carry enough energy (about three electron volts or more) to excite certain doubly bonded molecules into permanent chemical rearrangement. In DNA, this causes lasting damage. DNA is also indirectly damaged by reactive oxygen species produced by ultraviolet A (UVA), which has energy too low to damage DNA directly. This is why ultraviolet at all wavelengths can damage DNA, and is capable of causing cancer, and (for UVB) skin burns (sunburn) that are far worse than would be produced by simple heating (temperature increase) effects. This property of causing molecular damage that is out of proportion to heating effects, is characteristic of all EMR with frequencies at the visible light range and above. These properties of high-frequency EMR are due to quantum effects that permanently damage materials and tissues at the molecular level.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the higher end of the ultraviolet range, the energy of photons becomes large enough to impart enough energy to electrons to cause them to be liberated from the atom, in a process called photoionisation. The energy required for this is always larger than about 10 electron volts (eV) corresponding with wavelengths smaller than 124?nm (some sources suggest a more realistic cutoff of 33 eV, which is the energy required to ionize water). This high end of the ultraviolet spectrum with energies in the approximate ionization range, is sometimes called \\"extreme UV.\\" Ionizing UV is strongly filtered by the Earth's atmosphere).[citation needed]\\r\\nElectromagnetic radiation composed of photons that carry minimum-ionization energy, or more, (which includes the entire spectrum with shorter wavelengths), is therefore termed ionizing radiation. (Many other kinds of ionizing radiation are made of non-EM particles). Electromagnetic-type ionizing radiation extends from the extreme ultraviolet to all higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths, which means that all X-rays and gamma rays qualify. These are capable of the most severe types of molecular damage, which can happen in biology to any type of biomolecule, including mutation and cancer, and often at great depths below the skin, since the higher end of the X-ray spectrum, and all of the gamma ray spectrum, penetrate matter.\\r\\nMost UV and X-rays are blocked by absorption first from molecular nitrogen, and then (for wavelengths in the upper UV) from the electronic excitation of dioxygen and finally ozone at the mid-range of UV. Only 30% of the Sun's ultraviolet light reaches the ground, and almost all of this is well transmitted.\\r\\nVisible light is well transmitted in air, as it is not energetic enough to excite nitrogen, oxygen, or ozone, but too energetic to excite molecular vibrational frequencies of water vapor.[citation needed]\\r\\nAbsorption bands in the infrared are due to modes of vibrational excitation in water vapor. However, at energies too low to excite water vapor, the atmosphere becomes transparent again, allowing free transmission of most microwave and radio waves.[citation needed]\\r\\nFinally, at radio wavelengths longer than 10 meters or so (about 30?MHz), the air in the lower atmosphere remains transparent to radio, but plasma in certain layers of the ionosphere begins to interact with radio waves (see skywave). This property allows some longer wavelengths (100 meters or 3?MHz) to be reflected and results in shortwave radio beyond line-of-sight. However, certain ionospheric effects begin to block incoming radiowaves from space, when their frequency is less than about 10?MHz (wavelength longer than about 30 meters).[citation needed]\\r\\nRadio waves have the least amount of energy and the lowest frequency. When radio waves impinge upon a conductor, they couple to the conductor, travel along it and induce an electric current on the conductor surface by moving the electrons of the conducting material in correlated bunches of charge. Such effects can cover macroscopic distances in conductors (such as radio antennas), since the wavelength of radiowaves is long.\\r\\nMicrowaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from as long as one meter to as short as one millimeter; with frequencies between 300?MHz (0.3?GHz) and 300?GHz.\\r\\nNatural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum. EM radiation with a wavelength between approximately 400 nm and 700?nm is directly detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially nearby infrared (longer than 700?nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400?nm) are also sometimes referred to as light.\\r\\nThe basic structure of matter involves charged particles bound together. When electromagnetic radiation impinges on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the context. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to thermal equilibrium and manifesting itself as thermal energy, or even kinetic energy, in the material. With a few exceptions related to high-energy photons (such as fluorescence, harmonic generation, photochemical reactions, the photovoltaic effect for ionizing radiations at far ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation), absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the material. This happens for infrared, microwave and radio wave radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In addition to infrared lasers, sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can easily set paper afire.[33][citation needed]\\r\\nIonizing radiation creates high-speed electrons in a material and breaks chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms eventually most of the energy becomes thermal energy all in a tiny fraction of a second. This process makes ionizing radiation far more dangerous per unit of energy than non-ionizing radiation. This caveat also applies to UV, even though almost all of it is not ionizing, because UV can damage molecules due to electronic excitation, which is far greater per unit energy than heating effects.[33][citation needed]\\r\\nInfrared radiation in the spectral distribution of a black body is usually considered a form of heat, since it has an equivalent temperature and is associated with an entropy change per unit of thermal energy. However, \\"heat\\" is a technical term in physics and thermodynamics and is often confused with thermal energy. Any type of electromagnetic energy can be transformed into thermal energy in interaction with matter. Thus, any electromagnetic radiation can \\"heat\\" (in the sense of increase the thermal energy temperature of) a material, when it is absorbed.[34]\\r\\nThe inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is thermal radiation. Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter, with the deposited energy heating the material.[35]\\r\\nThe electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum radiation entropy.[36]\\r\\nBioelectromagnetics is the study of the interactions and effects of EM radiation on living organisms. The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those in humans, depends upon the radiation's power and frequency. For low-frequency radiation (radio waves to visible light) the best-understood effects are those due to radiation power alone, acting through heating when radiation is absorbed. For these thermal effects, frequency is important only as it affects penetration into the organism (for example, microwaves penetrate better than infrared). It is widely accepted that low frequency fields that are too weak to cause significant heating could not possibly have any biological effect.[37]\\r\\nDespite the commonly accepted results, some research has been conducted to show that weaker non-thermal electromagnetic fields, (including weak ELF magnetic fields, although the latter does not strictly qualify as EM radiation[37][38][39]), and modulated RF and microwave fields have biological effects.[40][41][42] Fundamental mechanisms of the interaction between biological material and electromagnetic fields at non-thermal levels are not fully understood.[37]\\r\\nThe World Health Organization has classified radio frequency electromagnetic radiation as Group 2B - possibly carcinogenic.[43][44] This group contains possible carcinogens such as lead, DDT, and styrene. For example, epidemiological studies looking for a relationship between cell phone use and brain cancer development, have been largely inconclusive, save to demonstrate that the effect, if it exists, cannot be a large one.\\r\\nAt higher frequencies (visible and beyond), the effects of individual photons begin to become important, as these now have enough energy individually to directly or indirectly damage biological molecules.[45] All UV frequences have been classed as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer.[46][47]\\r\\nThus, at UV frequencies and higher (and probably somewhat also in the visible range),[32] electromagnetic radiation does more damage to biological systems than simple heating predicts. This is most obvious in the \\"far\\" (or \\"extreme\\") ultraviolet. UV, with X-ray and gamma radiation, are referred to as ionizing radiation due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce ions and free radicals in materials (including living tissue). Since such radiation can severely damage life at energy levels that produce little heating, it is considered far more dangerous (in terms of damage-produced per unit of energy, or power) than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum.\\r\\nElectromagnetic waves were predicted by the classical laws of electricity and magnetism, known as Maxwell's equations. Inspection of Maxwell's equations without sources (charges or currents) results in nontrivial solutions of changing electric and magnetic fields.

Also, E and B far-fields in free space, which as wave solutions depend primarily on these two Maxwell equations, are in-phase with each other. This is guaranteed since the generic wave solution is first order in both space and time, and the curl operator on one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of the wave solution, while the time-derivative on the other side of the equations, which gives the other field, is first-order in time, resulting in the same phase shift for both fields in each mathematical operation.\\r\\nFrom the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left. This picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as polarization. On a quantum level, it is described as photon polarization. The direction of the polarization is defined as the direction of the electric field.\\r\\nMore general forms of the second-order wave equations given above are available, allowing for both non-vacuum propagation media and sources. Many competing derivations exist, all with varying levels of approximation and intended applications. One very general example is a form of the electric field equation,[48] which was factorized into a pair of explicitly directional wave equations, and then efficiently reduced into a single uni-directional wave equation by means of a simple slow-evolution approximation.","input":"Who discovered that light is an electromagnetic wave?"},{"output":"slaves","context":"\\"Rule, Britannia!\\" is a British patriotic song, originating from the poem \\"Rule, Britannia\\" by James Thomson and set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740.[1] It is strongly associated with the Royal Navy, but also used by the British Army.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis British national air was originally included in Alfred, a masque about Alfred the Great co-written by Thomson and David Mallet and first performed at Cliveden, country home of Frederick, Prince of Wales (the eldest son of George II and father of the future George III, as well as the great-grandfather of Queen Victoria), on 1 August 1740, to commemorate the accession of George II and the third birthday of the Princess Augusta.[3]\\r\\nFrederick, a German prince who arrived in England as an adult and was on very bad terms with his father, was making considerable efforts to ingratiate himself and build a following among his subjects-to-be (which came to naught, as he predeceased his father and never became king). A masque linking the prince with both the medieval hero-king Alfred the Great's victories over the Vikings and with the current building of British sea power ÿ exemplified by the recent successful capture of Porto Bello from the Spanish by Admiral Vernon on 21 November 1739, avenging in the eyes of the British public Admiral Hosier's disastrous Blockade of Porto Bello of 1726ÿ27 ÿ went well with his political plans and aspirations.\\r\\nThomson was a Scottish poet and playwright, who spent most of his adult life in England and hoped to make his fortune at Court. He had an interest in helping foster a British identity, including and transcending the older English, Irish, Welsh and Scottish identities.\\r\\nThomson had written The Tragedy of Sophonisba (1730), based on the historical figure of Sophonisba ÿ a proud princess of Carthage, a major sea-power of the ancient world, who had committed suicide rather than submit to slavery at the hands of the Romans. This might have some bearing on the song's famous refrain \\"Britons never will be slaves!\\". Incidentally, Thomson wrote the word \\"never\\" only once, but it has been popularly corrupted to \\"never, never, never\\", possibly because it is actually easier to sing. The same theme was repeated in the Navy's own \\"Heart of Oak\\", written two decades later: To honour we call you, as freemen not slaves/For who are so free as the sons of the waves?.\\r\\nIn 1751 Mallet altered the lyrics, omitting three of the original six stanzas and adding three others, written by Lord Bolingbroke. This version known as \\"Married to a Mermaid\\" became extremely popular when Mallet produced his masque of Britannia at Drury Lane Theatre in 1755.\\r\\nThis version is taken from The Works of James Thomson by James Thomson, Published 1763, Vol II, p.?191, which includes the entire original text of Alfred.\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n4\\r\\n5\\r\\n6\\r\\nAlthough the lyrics are usually set out as above, the lines as set to the music are sung in contemporary time according to either of the following variants:\\r\\nTraditionally rendered,\\r\\nAnd now commonly rendered in alternate form:\\r\\nVariations: Never, never, never is sometimes sung as a single \\"never\\" over the same melodic phrase (an example of a melisma); this being the original arrangement by Arne.\\r\\nThe song soon developed an independent life of its own, separate from the masque of which it had formed a part. First heard in London in 1745, it achieved instant popularity. It quickly became so well known that Handel quoted it in his Occasional Oratorio in the following year. Handel used the first phrase as part of the Act II soprano aria, \\"Prophetic visions strike my eye\\", when the soprano sings it at the words \\"War shall cease, welcome peace!\\"[4] Similarly, \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" was seized upon by the Jacobites, who altered Thomson's words to a pro-Jacobite version.[5]\\r\\nHowever, Thomson's original words remained best-known. Their denunciation of \\"foreign tyrants\\" [\\"haughty tyrants\\"?] has some foundation as Great Britain's period of Parliamentary Commonwealth had decisively curbed royal prerogative, leading to the Bill of Rights of 1689 and it was on the way to developing its constitutional monarchy, in marked contrast to the Royal Absolutism still prevalent in Europe. Britain and France were at war for much of the century and hostile in between (see \\"Second Hundred Years' War\\") and the French Bourbons were undoubtedly the prime example of \\"haughty tyrants\\", whose \\"slaves\\" Britons should never be.\\r\\nAccording to Armitage[6] \\"Rule, Britannia'\\" was the most lasting expression of the conception of Britain and the British Empire that emerged in the 1730s, \\"predicated on a mixture of adulterated mercantilism, nationalistic anxiety and libertarian fervour\\". He equates the song with Bolingbroke's On the Idea of a Patriot King (1738), also written for the private circle of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in which Bolingbroke had \\"raised the spectre of permanent standing armies that might be turned against the British people rather than their enemies.\\"[7] Hence British naval power could be equated with civil liberty, since an island nation with a strong navy to defend it could afford to dispense with a standing army which, since the time of Cromwell, was seen as a threat and a source of tyranny.\\r\\nAt the time it appeared the song was not a celebration of an existing state of naval affairs, but an exhortation. Although the Dutch Republic, which in the 17th century presented a major challenge to English sea power, was obviously past its peak by 1745, Britain did not yet \\"rule the waves\\", although, since it was written during the War of Jenkins' Ear, it could be argued that the words referred to the alleged Spanish aggression against British merchant vessels that caused the war. The time was still to come when the Royal Navy would be an unchallenged dominant force on the oceans. The jesting lyrics of the mid-18th century would assume a material and patriotic significance by the end of the 19th century.\\r\\n\\"Rule, Britannia!\\" is often written as simply \\"Rule Britannia\\", erroneously omitting both the comma and the exclamation mark, which changes the interpretation of the lyric by altering the grammar. Richard Dawkins recounts in The Selfish Gene that the repeated exclamation \\"Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!\\" is often rendered as \\"Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!\\", changing both the meaning and inflection of the verse. This addition of a terminal 's' to the lyrics is used as an example of a successful meme.[8]\\r\\nMaurice Willson Disher notes that the change from \\"Britannia, rule the waves\\" to \\"Britannia rules the waves\\" occurred in the Victorian era, at a time when the British did rule the waves and no longer needed to be exhorted to rule them. Disher also notes that the Victorians changed \\"will\\" to \\"shall\\" in the line \\"Britons never shall be slaves.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe song assumed extra significance in 1945 at the conclusion of World War II when it was played at the ceremonial surrender of the Japanese imperial army in Singapore. A massed military band of Australian, British and American forces played as Supreme Allied Commander Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma arrived.[10]\\r\\n\\"Rule, Britannia!\\" (in an orchestral arrangement by Sir Malcolm Sargent) is traditionally performed at the BBC's Last Night of the Proms, normally with a guest soloist (past performers have included Jane Eaglen, Bryn Terfel, Thomas Hampson and Felicity Lott). It has always been the last part of Sir Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs, except that for many years up until 2000, the Sargent arrangement has been used. However, in recent years the inclusion of the song and other patriotic tunes has been much criticisednotably by Leonard Slatkinand the presentation has been occasionally amended.[11] For some years the performance at the Last Night of the Proms reverted to Sir Henry Wood's original arrangement. When Bryn Terfel performed it at the Proms in 1994 and 2008 he sang the third verse in Welsh. The text is available at Rule Britannia (in Welsh).\\r\\nThe melody was the theme for a set of variations for piano by Ludwig van Beethoven (WoO 79)[12] and he also used it in \\"Wellington's Victory\\", Op. 91.\\r\\nRichard Wagner wrote a concert overture in D major based on the theme in 1837 (WWV 42).\\r\\nJohann Strauss I quoted the song in full as the introduction to his 1838 waltz \\"Huldigung der K?nigin Victoria von Grossbritannien\\" (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain), Op. 103, where he also quotes the British national anthem \\"God Save the Queen\\" at the end of the piece.\\r\\nThe French organist-composer Alexandre Guilmant included this tune in his Fantaisie sur deux mlodies anglaises for organ Op. 43, where he also makes use of the song \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\".\\r\\nArthur Sullivan, Britain's leading composer during the reign of Queen Victoria, quoted from \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" on at least three occasions in music for his comic operas written with W. S. Gilbert and Bolton Rowe. In Utopia Limited, Sullivan used airs from \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" to highlight references to Great Britain. In The Zoo (written with Rowe) Sullivan applied the tune of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" to an instance in which Rowe's libretto quotes directly from the patriotic march. Finally, to celebrate the jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, Sullivan added a chorus of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" to the finale of HMS Pinafore, which was playing in revival at the Savoy Theatre. Sullivan also quoted the tune in his 1897 ballet Victoria and Merrie England, which traced the \\"history\\" of England from the time of the Druids up to Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, an event the ballet was meant to celebrate.\\r\\nThe part of the tune's refrain on the word \\"never\\" (often corrupted to \\"never, never, never\\"), is among those claimed to have provided the theme on which Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations are based. Elgar also quotes the opening phrase of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" in his choral work The Music Makers, based on Arthur O'Shaughnessy's Ode at the line \\"We fashion an empire's glory\\", where he also quotes \\"La Marseillaise\\".","input":"What is the last word of rule britannia?"},{"output":"Farallon Plate","context":"The Sierra Nevada (/si??r? n??v?d?, -?v?d?/, Spanish:?[?sjera ne?aea], snowy saw range[6]) is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Basin and Range Province. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada. The Sierra Nevada is part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges that consists of an almost continuous sequence of such ranges that form the western \\"backbone\\" of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.\\r\\nThe Sierra runs 400 miles (640?km) north-to-south, and is approximately 70 miles (110?km) across east-to-west. Notable Sierra features include Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at 14,505?ft (4,421?m),[1] the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley, sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite. The Sierra is home to three national parks, twenty wilderness areas, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile National Monument.\\r\\nThe character of the range is shaped by its geology and ecology. More than one hundred million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift four million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada has a significant history. The California Gold Rush occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855. Due to inaccessibility, the range was not fully explored until 1912.[7]:81\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada lies in Central and Eastern California, with a very small but historically important spur extending into Nevada. West-to-east, the Sierra Nevada's elevation increases gradually from 1,000 feet (300?m) in the Central Valley to an average height of about 10,500 feet (3,200?m) at its crest only 50ÿ75 miles (80ÿ121?km) to the east. The east slope forms the steep Sierra Escarpment. Unlike its surroundings, the range receives a substantial amount of snowfall and precipitation due to orographic lift.\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada's irregular northern boundary stretches from the Susan River[8] and Fredonyer Pass[9] to the North Fork Feather River. It represents where the granitic bedrock of the Sierra Nevada dives below the southern extent of Cenozoic igneous surface rock from the Cascade Range.[10] It is bounded on the west by California's Central Valley and on the east by the Basin and Range Province.\\r\\nThe geographical boundary between the Sierra and the Cascades is virtually indistinguishable, with the Fredonyer Pass designation being traditional. Physiographically, the Sierra is a section of the Cascade-Sierra Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System physiographic division. The California Geological Survey states that \\"the northern Sierra boundary is marked where bedrock disappears under the Cenozoic volcanic cover of the Cascade Range.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe range is drained on its western slope by the Central Valley watershed, which discharges into the Pacific Ocean at San Francisco. The northern third of the western Sierra is part of the Sacramento River watershed (including the Feather, Yuba, and American River tributaries), and the middle third is drained by the San Joaquin River (including the Mokelumne, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced River tributaries). The southern third of the range is drained by the Kings, Kaweah, Tule, and Kern rivers, which flow into the endorheic basin of Tulare Lake, which rarely overflows into the San Joaquin during wet years.\\r\\nThe eastern slope watershed of the Sierra is much narrower; its rivers flow out into the endorheic Great Basin of eastern California and western Nevada. From north to south, the Susan River flows into intermittent Honey Lake, the Truckee River flows from Lake Tahoe into Pyramid Lake, the Carson River runs into Carson Sink, the Walker River into Walker Lake; Rush, Lee Vining and Mill Creeks flow into Mono Lake; and the Owens River into dry Owens Lake. Although none of the eastern rivers reach the sea, many of the streams from Mono Lake southwards are diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct which provides water to Southern California.\\r\\nThe height of the mountains in the Sierra Nevada increases gradually from north to south. Between Fredonyer Pass and Lake Tahoe, the peaks range from 5,000 feet (1,500?m) to more than 9,000 feet (2,700?m). The crest near Lake Tahoe is roughly 9,000 feet (2,700?m) high, with several peaks approaching the height of Freel Peak (10,881?ft or 3,317?m). Farther south, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park is Mount Lyell (13,120?ft or 3,999?m). The Sierra rises to almost 14,000 feet (4,300?m) with Mount Humphreys near Bishop, California. Finally, near Lone Pine, Mount Whitney is at 14,505 feet (4,421?m), the highest point in the contiguous United States.\\r\\nSouth of Mount Whitney, the range quickly dwindles. The crest elevation is almost 10,000 feet (3,000?m) near Lake Isabella, but south of the lake, the peaks reach to only a modest 8,000 feet (2,400?m).[12]\\r\\nThere are several notable geographical features in the Sierra Nevada:\\r\\nCommunities in the Sierra Nevada range include Carson City, Paradise, South Lake Tahoe, Truckee, Grass Valley, Mammoth Lakes, Sonora, Nevada City, Portola, Auburn, Colfax and Kennedy Meadows.\\r\\nMuch of the Sierra Nevada consists of federal lands and is either protected from development or strictly managed. The three National Parks (Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia), two National Monuments (Devils Postpile, Giant Sequoia), and 26 wilderness areas lie within the Sierra. These areas protect 15.4% of the Sierra's 63,118?km2 (24,370?sq?mi) from logging and grazing.[4]\\r\\nThe United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management currently control 52% of the land in the Sierra Nevada.[4] Logging and grazing are generally allowed on land controlled by these agencies, under federal regulations that balance recreation and development on the land.\\r\\nThe California Bighorn Sheep Zoological Area near Mount Williamson in the southern Sierra was established to protect the endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. Starting in 1981, hikers were unable to enter the Area from May 15 through December 15, in order to protect the sheep. As of 2010, the restriction has been lifted and access to the Area is open for the whole year.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest rocks in the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest being metasedimentary rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region.[16] These dark-colored hornfels, slates, marbles, and schists are found in the western foothills (notably around Coarsegold, west of the Tehachapi Pass) and east of the Sierra Crest.[17] The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2N.[18] In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny.[19] Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.\\r\\nIn the Cretaceous, a subduction zone formed at the edge of the continent.[20] This means that an oceanic plate started to dive beneath the North American plate. Magma formed through the subduction of the ancient Farallon Plate rose in plumes (plutons) deep underground, their combined mass forming what is called the Sierra Nevada batholith. These plutons formed at various times, from 115?Ma to 87?Ma.[21] The earlier plutons formed in the western half of the Sierra, while the later plutons formed in the eastern half of the Sierra.[18] By 66?Ma, the proto-Sierra Nevada had been worn down to a range of rolling low mountains, a few thousand feet high.\\r\\nTwenty million years ago, crustal extension associated with the Basin and Range Province caused extensive volcanism in the Sierra.[22] About 10?Ma, the Sierra Nevada started to form: a block of crust between the Coast Range and the Basin and Range Province started to tilt to the west.[23] Rivers started cutting deep canyons on both sides of the range. Lava filled some of these canyons, which have subsequently eroded leaving table mountains that follow the old river channels.[24]\\r\\nAbout 2.5?Ma, the Earth's climate cooled, and ice ages started. Glaciers carved out characteristic U-shaped canyons throughout the Sierra. The combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the uppermost portions of the plutons emplaced millions of years before, leaving only a remnant of metamorphic rock on top of some Sierra peaks.\\r\\nUplift of the Sierra Nevada continues today, especially along its eastern side. This uplift causes large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake of 1872.[25]\\r\\nThe climate of the Sierra Nevada is influenced by the Mediterranean climate of California. During the fall, winter and spring, precipitation in the Sierra ranges from 20 to 80?in (510 to 2,030?mm) where it occurs mostly as snow above 6,000?ft (1,800?m). Precipitation is highest on the central and northern portions of the western slope between 5,000 and 8,000 feet (1,500 and 2,400?m) elevation, due to orographic lift.[21]:69 Above 8,000 feet (2,400?m), precipitation diminishes on the western slope up to the crest, since most of the precipitation has been wrung out at lower elevations. Most parts of the range east of the crest are in a rain shadow, and receive less than 25 inches of precipitation per year.[26] While most summer days are dry, afternoon thunderstorms sometimes occur, particularly during the North American Monsoon in mid and late summer. Some of these summer thunderstorms drop over an inch of rain in a short period, and the lightning can start fires. Summer high temperatures average 42ÿ90?F (6ÿ32?C). Winters are comparatively mild, and the temperature is usually only just low enough to sustain a heavy snowpack. For example, Tuolumne Meadows, at 8,600 feet (2,600?m) elevation, has winter daily highs about 40?F (4?C) with daily lows about 10?F (?12?C).[27] The growing season lasts 20 to 230 days, strongly dependent on elevation.[28] The highest elevations of the Sierra have an alpine climate.\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada snowpack is the major source of water and a significant source of electric power generation in California.[29] Many reservoirs were constructed in the canyons of the Sierra throughout the 20th century, Several major aqueducts serving both agriculture and urban areas distribute Sierra water throughout the state. However, the Sierra casts a rain shadow, which greatly affects the climate and ecology of the central Great Basin. This rain shadow is largely responsible for Nevada's being the driest state in the United States.[30]\\r\\nPrecipitation varies substantially from year to year. It is not uncommon for some years to receive precipitation totals far above or below normal.\\r\\nThe height of the range and the steepness of the Sierra Escarpment, particularly at the southern end of the range, produces a wind phenomenon known as the \\"Sierra Rotor\\". This is a horizontal rotation of the atmosphere just east of the crest of the Sierra, set in motion as an effect of strong westerly winds.[31]\\r\\n Because of the large number of airplanes that have crashed in the Sierra Nevada, primarily due to the complex weather and atmospheric conditions such as downdrafts and microbursts caused by geography there, a portion of the area, a triangle whose vertices are Reno, Nevada; Fresno, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada, has been dubbed the \\"Nevada Triangle\\", in reference to the Bermuda Triangle. Some counts put the number of crashes in the triangle at 2,000, including millionaire and record-breaking flyer Steve Fossett. Theories that the crashes are related in some way to the United States Air Force's Area 51, or to the activities of extra-terrestrial aliens, have no evidence to support them.[32][33]\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada is divided into a number of biotic zones, each of which is defined by its climate and supports a number of interdependent species.[21] Life in the higher elevation zones adapted to colder weather, and to most of the precipitation falling as snow. The rain shadow of the Sierra causes the eastern slope to be warmer and drier: each life zone is higher in the east.[21] A list of biotic zones, and corresponding elevations, is presented below:\\r\\nArchaeological excavations placed Martis people of Paleo-Indians in northcentral Sierra Nevada during the period of 3,000?BCE to 500?CE. The earliest identified sustaining indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada were the Northern Paiute tribes on the east side, with the Mono tribe and Sierra Miwok tribe on the western side, and the Kawaiisu and Tubatulabal tribes in the southern Sierra. Today, some historic intertribal trade route trails over mountain passes are known artifact locations, such as Duck Pass with its obsidian arrowheads. The California and Sierra Native American tribes were predominantly peaceful, with occasional territorial disputes between the Paiute and Sierra Miwok tribes in the mountains.[35] Washo and Maidu were also in this area prior to the era of European exploration and displacement.[36][37]\\r\\nUsed in 1542 by Juan Rodrguez Cabrillo to describe a Pacific Coast Range (Santa Cruz Mountains), the term \\"sierra nevada\\" was a general identification of less familiar ranges toward the interior.[40] In 1776, Pedro Font's map applied the name to the range currently known as the Sierra Nevada.[41]\\r\\nThe literal translation is \\"snowy mountains,\\" from sierra \\"a range of hills,\\" 1610s, from Spanish sierra \\"jagged mountain range,\\" lit. \\"saw,\\" from Latin serra \\"a saw\\"; and from fem. of Spanish nevado \\"snowy.\\"[42][43]\\r\\nEuropean-American exploration of the mountain range started in 1827. Although prior to the 1820s there were Spanish missions, pueblos (towns), presidios (forts), and ranchos along the coast of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada.[44] The first European Americans to visit the mountains were amongst a group led by fur trapper Jedediah Smith, crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827, at Ebbetts Pass.[44]\\r\\nIn 1833, a subgroup of the Bonneville Expedition led by Joseph Reddeford Walker was sent westward to find an overland route to California. Eventually the party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada, starting near present-day Bridgeport and descending between the Tuolumne and Merced River drainage. The group may have been the first non-indigenous people to see Yosemite Valley.[45] The Walker party probably visited either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees,[44] but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.[46]\\r\\nIn the winter of 1844, Lt. John C. Frmont, accompanied by Kit Carson, was the first European to see Lake Tahoe. The Frmont party camped at 8,050?ft (2,450?m).[47]\\r\\nThe California Gold Rush began at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma, in the western foothills of the Sierra.[48] On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall, a foreman working for Sacramento pioneer John Sutter, found shiny metal in the tailrace of a lumber mill Marshall was building for Sutter on the American River.[49] Rumors soon started to spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan. Brannan strode through the streets of San Francisco, holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting \\"Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!\\"[49]\\r\\nOn August 19, 1848, the New York Herald was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold. On December 5, 1848, President James Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress.[50]:80 Soon, waves of immigrants from around the world, later called the \\"forty-niners\\", invaded the Gold Country of California or \\"Mother Lode\\". Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.[51] Wherever gold was discovered, hundreds of miners would collaborate to put up a camp and stake their claims.\\r\\nBecause the gold in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply panned for gold in California's rivers and streams.[52]:198ÿ200 However, panning cannot take place on a large scale, and miners and groups of miners graduated to more complex placer mining. Groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.[53]:90\\r\\nBy 1853, most of the easily accessible gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. Hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the gold fields.[50]:89 In hydraulic mining, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds. It is estimated that by the mid-1880s, 11 million ounces (340?t) of gold (worth approximately US$15?billion at December 2010 prices) had been recovered by \\"hydraulicking\\".[54] A byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants went into streams and rivers.[53]:32ÿ36 As of 1999[update], many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life.[53]:116ÿ121\\r\\nIt is estimated that by 1855, at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world.[50]:25 The huge numbers of newcomers brought by the Gold Rush drove Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners, provoking counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered.[53]\\r\\nThe Gold Rush populated the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, but even by 1860, most of the Sierra was unexplored.[7][55] The state legislature authorized the California Geological Survey to officially explore the Sierra (and survey the rest of the state). Josiah Whitney was appointed to head the survey. Men of the survey, including William H. Brewer, Charles F. Hoffmann and Clarence King, explored the backcountry of what would become Yosemite National Park in 1863.[7] In 1864, they explored the area around Kings Canyon. In 1869, John Muir started his wanderings in the Sierra Nevada range,[56] and in 1871, King was the first to climb Mount Langley also that year, fishermen were the first to climb Mount Whitney.[7] From 1892ÿ7 Theodore Solomons made the first attempt to map a route along the crest of the Sierra.[7]\\r\\nOther people finished exploring and mapping the Sierra. Bolton Coit Brown explored the Kings River watershed in 1895ÿ1899. Joseph N. LeConte mapped the area around Yosemite National Park and what would become Kings Canyon National Park. James S. Hutchinson, a noted mountaineer, climbed the Palisades (1904) and Mount Humphreys (1905). By 1912, the USGS published a set of maps of the Sierra Nevada, and the era of exploration was over.[7]:81\\r\\nThe tourism potential of the Sierra Nevada was recognized early in the European history of the range. Yosemite Valley was first protected by the federal government in 1864. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were ceded to California in 1866 and turned into a state park.[45] John Muir perceived overgrazing by sheep and logging of Giant Sequoia to be a problem in the Sierra. Muir successfully lobbied for the protection of the rest of Yosemite National Park: Congress created an Act to protect the park in 1890. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were added to the Park in 1906.[45] In the same year, Sequoia National Park was formed to protect the Giant Sequoia: all logging of the Sequoia ceased at that time.\\r\\nIn 1903, the city of San Francisco proposed building a hydroelectric dam to flood Hetch Hetchy Valley. The city and the Sierra Club argued over the dam for 10 years, until the U.S. Congress passed the Raker Act in 1913 and allowed dam building to proceed. O'Shaughnessy Dam was completed in 1923.[57][58]\\r\\nBetween 1912 and 1918, Congress debated three times to protect Lake Tahoe in a national park. None of these efforts succeeded, and after World War II, towns such as South Lake Tahoe grew around the shores of the lake. By 1980, the permanent population of the Lake Tahoe area grew to 50,000, while the summer population grew to 90,000.[59] The development around Lake Tahoe affected the clarity of the lake water. In order to preserve the lake's clarity, construction in the Tahoe basin is currently regulated by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.[60]\\r\\nAs the 20th century progressed, more of the Sierra became available for recreation; other forms of economic activity decreased. The John Muir Trail, a trail that followed the Sierra crest from Yosemite Valley to Mount Whitney, was funded in 1915 and finished in 1938.[61] Kings Canyon National Park was formed in 1940 to protect the deep canyon of the Kings River.\\r\\nBy 1964, the Wilderness Act protected portions of the Sierra as primitive areas where humans are simply temporary visitors. Gradually, 20 wilderness areas were established to protect scenic backcountry of the Sierra. These wilderness areas include the John Muir Wilderness (protecting the eastern slope of the Sierra and the area between Yosemite and Kings Canyon Parks), and wilderness within each of the National Parks. Because of the Wilderness Act and the rocky terrain in the area, plans to construct two trans-Sierra highways across this portion of the Sierra Escarpment, State Route 168[62] and State Route 190,[63] were abandoned; the two highways each remain split as discontiguous segments on either side of the Sierra.\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada still faces a number of issues that threaten its conservation. Logging occurs on both private and public lands, including controversial clearcut methods and thinning logging on private and public lands.[64] Grazing occurs on private lands as well as on National Forest lands, which include Wilderness areas. Overgrazing can alter hydrologic processes and vegetation composition, remove vegetation that serves as food and habitat for native species, and contribute to sedimentation and pollution in waterways.[65] A recent increase in large wildfires like the Rim Fire in Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest and the King Fire on the Eldorado National Forest, has prompted concerns.[64] A 2015 study indicated that the increase in fire risk in California may be attributable to human-induced climate change.[66] A study looking back over 8,000 years found that warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and more stand-replacing fires and concluded that as climate is such a powerful influence on wildfires, trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future.[67]","input":"What plate is the sierra nevada mountains on?"},{"output":"heavily export-dependent","context":"","input":"What type of economic system does thailand have?"},{"output":"Lords Proprietors","context":"","input":"Who founded the first colony in north carolina?"},{"output":"85,792","context":"Nickname(s): \\"The Garden City\\"[1]\\r\\nVictoria /v?k?t??ri?/ is the capital city of the Canadian province of British Columbia, and is located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island off Canada's Pacific coast. The city has a population of 85,792, while the metropolitan area of Greater Victoria has a population of 383,360, making it the 15th most populous Canadian metropolitan area. The city of Victoria is the 7th most densely populated city in Canada with 4,405.8 people per square kilometre, which is a greater population density than Toronto, Ontario.[6]\\r\\nVictoria is the southernmost major city in Western Canada, and is located about 100 kilometres (60 miles) from BC's largest city of Vancouver on the mainland. The city is about 100?km (60?mi) from Seattle by airplane, ferry, or the Victoria Clipper passenger-only ferry which operates daily, year round between Seattle and Victoria and 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Port Angeles, Washington, by ferry Coho across the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\\r\\nNamed after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and, at the time, British North America, Victoria is one of the oldest cities in the Pacific Northwest, with British settlement beginning in 1843. The city has retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, Legislative buildings (finished in 1897 and home of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia) and the Empress hotel (opened in 1908). The city's Chinatown is the second oldest in North America after San Francisco's. The region's Coast Salish First Nations peoples established communities in the area long before non-native settlement, possibly several thousand years earlier, which had large populations at the time of European exploration.\\r\\nKnown as \\"The Garden City\\", Victoria is an attractive city and a popular tourism destination with a thriving technology sector that has risen to be its largest revenue-generating private industry.[7] Victoria is in the top twenty of world cities for quality-of-life,[8] according to Numbeo. The city has a large non-local student population, who come to attend the University of Victoria, Camosun College, Royal Roads University, the Victoria College of Art, the Sooke Schools International Programme and the Canadian College of Performing Arts. Victoria is very popular with boaters with its beautiful and rugged shorelines and beaches. Victoria is also popular with retirees, who come to enjoy the temperate and usually snow-free climate of the area as well as the usually relaxed pace of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the arrival of European navigators in the late 1700s, the Victoria area was home to several communities of Coast Salish peoples, including the Songhees. The Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of Juan Prez in 1774 and of James Cook. In 1778, although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not penetrated until 1790, Spanish sailors visited Esquimalt Harbour (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.\\r\\nIn 1841 James Douglas was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by George Simpson that a new more northerly post be built in case Fort Vancouver fell into American hands (see Oregon boundary dispute). Douglas founded Fort Victoria, on the site of present-day Victoria, British Columbia in anticipation of the outcome of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, extending the British North America/United States border along the 49th parallel from the Rockies to the Strait of Georgia.[citation needed]\\r\\nErected in 1843 as a Hudson's Bay Company trading post on a site originally called Camosun (the native word was \\"camosack\\", meaning \\"rush of water\\")[citation needed] known briefly as \\"Fort Albert\\", the settlement was renamed Fort Victoria in November 1843, in honour of Queen Victoria.[9][10] The Songhees established a village across the harbour from the fort. The Songhees' village was later moved north of Esquimalt. When the crown colony was established in 1849, a town was laid out on the site and made the capital of the colony. The superintendent of the fort, Chief Factor James Douglas was made the second governor of the Vancouver Island Colony (Richard Blanshard was first governor, Arthur Edward Kennedy was third and last governor), and would be the leading figure in the early development of the city until his retirement in 1864.\\r\\nWhen news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached San Francisco in 1858, Victoria became the port, supply base, and outfitting centre for miners on their way to the Fraser Canyon gold fields, mushrooming from a population of 300 to over 5000 within a few days. Victoria was incorporated as a city in 1862.[12] In 1865, Esquimalt was made the North Pacific home of the Royal Navy, and remains Canada's Pacific coast naval base. In 1866 when the island was politically united with the mainland, Victoria was designated the capital of the new united colony instead of New Westminster ÿ an unpopular move on the Mainland ÿ and became the provincial capital when British Columbia joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871.\\r\\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the Port of Victoria became one of North America's largest importers of opium, serving the opium trade from Hong Kong and distribution into North America. Opium trade was legal and unregulated until 1865, then the legislature issued licences and levied duties on its import and sale. The opium trade was banned in 1908.\\r\\nIn 1886, with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway terminus on Burrard Inlet, Victoria's position as the commercial centre of British Columbia was irrevocably lost to the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. The city subsequently began cultivating an image of genteel civility within its natural setting, aided by the impressions of visitors such as Rudyard Kipling, the opening of the popular Butchart Gardens in 1904 and the construction of the Empress Hotel by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1908. Robert Dunsmuir, a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed Craigdarroch Castle in the Rockland area, near the official residence of the province's lieutenant-governor. His son James Dunsmuir became premier and subsequently lieutenant-governor of the province and built his own grand residence at Hatley Park (used for several decades as Royal Roads Military College, now civilian Royal Roads University) in the present City of Colwood.\\r\\nA real-estate and development boom ended just before World War I, leaving Victoria with a large stock of Edwardian public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city's character. With the economic crash and a surplus of single men, Victoria became a target-rich environment for recruiting. Two militia infantry battalions, the 88th Victoria Fusiliers and the 50th Gordon Highlanders, formed in the immediate pre-war period. Victoria was the home of Sir Arthur Currie. He had been a high-school teacher and real-estate agent prior to the war and was the Commanding Officer of the Gordon Highlanders in the summer of 1914. Before the end of the war he would command the Canadian Corps.[13] A number of municipalities surrounding Victoria were incorporated during this period, including the Township of Esquimalt, the District of Oak Bay, and several municipalities on the Saanich Peninsula.[14]\\r\\nSince World War II the Victoria area has seen relatively steady growth, becoming home to two major universities. Since the 1980s the western suburbs have been incorporated as new municipalities, such as Colwood and Langford, which are known collectively as the Western Communities.\\r\\nGreater Victoria periodically experiences calls for the amalgamation of the thirteen municipal governments within the Capital Regional District.[15] The opponents of amalgamation state that separate governance affords residents a greater deal of local autonomy.[citation needed] The proponents of amalgamation argue that it would reduce duplication of services, while allowing for more efficient use of resources and the ability to better handle broad, regional issues and long-term planning.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe landscape of Victoria was formed by water in various forms. Pleistocene glaciation put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam till. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of sand and gravel. Marine clay settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the British Columbia Coast. Their thick dark topsoils denoted a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming until urbanization.\\r\\nVictoria has a mild warm summer Mediterranean climate (K?ppen Csb)[17] with mild, rainy winters and cool, dry and sunny summers.[18] Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha, place it in the Oceanic zone (Do).[19] Although Victoria is farther north than such \\"winter\\" cities as Ottawa, Quebec City, Minneapolis, and Zurich, westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean keep Victoria's winter temperatures substantially higher, with an average January temperature of 5.0?C (41?F) compared to Ottawa, the nation's capital, with ?10.2?C (14?F).\\r\\nAt the Victoria Gonzales weather station, daily temperatures rise above 30?C (86?F) on average less than one day per year and fall below 0?C (32?F) on average only ten nights per year. Victoria has recorded completely freeze-free winter seasons four times (in 1925/26, 1939/40, 1999/2000, and 2002/03). 1999 is the only calendar year on record without a single occurrence of frost. During this time the city went 718 days without freezing, starting on 23 December 1998 and ending 10 December 2000. The second longest frost-free period was a 686-day stretch covering 1925 and 1926, marking the first and last time the city has gone the entire season without dropping below 1?C (34?F).[20]\\r\\nDuring the winter, the average daily high and low temperatures are 8 and 4?C (46.4 and 39.2?F), respectively. The summer months are also relatively mild, with an average high temperature of 20?C (68?F) and low of 11?C (51.8?F), although inland areas often experience warmer daytime highs. The highest temperature ever recorded at Victoria Gonzales was 36.0?C (96.8?F) on 11 July 2007,[21] however the University of Victoria reached 37.6?C (99.7?F) on 29 July 2009.[22] The coldest temperature on record is ?18.9?C (?2?F) on 31 January 1893.[23] The average annual temperature varies from a high of 11.4?C (52.5?F) that was set in 2004 to a low of 8.6?C (47.5?F) set in 1916.[20]\\r\\nDue to the rain shadow effect of the nearby Olympic Mountains, Victoria is the driest location on the British Columbia coast and one of the driest in the region. Average precipitation amounts in the Greater Victoria area range from 608?mm (23.9?in) at the Gonzales observatory in the City of Victoria to 1,124?mm (44.3?in) in nearby Langford.[24] The Victoria Airport, 25?km (16?mi) north of the city, receives about 45% more precipitation than the city proper. Regional average precipitation amounts range from as low as 406?mm (16.0?in) on the north shore of the Olympic Peninsula[25] to 3,505?mm (138.0?in) in Port Renfrew located just 80?km (50?mi) away on the more exposed southwest coast of Vancouver Island. Vancouver measures 1,589?mm (63?in) annually and Seattle is at 952?mm (37.5?in).\\r\\nOne feature of Victoria's climate is that it has distinct dry and rainy seasons. Nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls during the four wettest months, November to February. Precipitation in December, the wettest month (109?mm or 4.3?in) is nearly eight times as high as in July, the driest month (14?mm or 0.55?in). Victoria experiences the driest summers in Canada (outside of the extreme northern reaches of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).[26]\\r\\nVictoria averages just 26?cm (10.2?in) of snow annually, about half that of Vancouver. Roughly one third of winters see virtually no snow, with less than 5?cm (1.97?in) falling during the entire season. When snow does fall, it rarely lasts long on the ground. Victoria averages just two or three days per year with at least 5?cm (1.97?in) of snow on the ground. Every few decades Victoria receives very large snowfalls, including the record breaking 100?cm (39.4?in) of snow that fell in December 1996. That amount places Victoria 3rd for biggest snowfall among major cities in Canada.\\r\\nWith 2,193 hours of bright sunshine annually during the last available measurement period, Victoria was the second sunniest city in British Columbia after Cranbrook. In July 2013, Victoria received 432.8 hours of bright sunshine, which is the most sunshine ever recorded in any month in British Columbia history.[27]\\r\\nVictoria's equable climate has also added to its reputation as the \\"City of Gardens\\". The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every February there is an annual \\"flower count\\" in what for the rest of the country and most of the province is still the dead of winter.\\r\\nDue to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, Gulf Islands, and parts of the Lower Mainland and Sunshine Coast) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including Quercus garryana (Garry oak), Arctostaphylos columbiana (Hairy manzanita), and Canada's only broad-leaf evergreen tree, Arbutus menziesii (Pacific madrone). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico.\\r\\nNon-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm Trachycarpus fortunei, which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria. One of these Trachycarpus palms stands in front of City Hall.[33]\\r\\nThe following is a list of neighbourhoods in the City of Victoria, as defined by the city planning department.[34] For a list of neighbourhoods in other area municipalities, see Greater Victoria, or the individual entries for those municipalities.\\r\\nInformal neighbourhoods include:\\r\\nThe population of Victoria was 80,017 in 2011. The Victoria Census Metropolitan Area, comprising thirteen municipalities informally referred to as Greater Victoria, has a population of 344,615 and is the largest urban area on Vancouver Island.[36] By population, Greater Victoria is the 15th largest metropolitan area in Canada. The Capital Regional District, which includes additional rural areas, has a total population of 345,164.\\r\\nVictoria is known for its disproportionately large retiree population. Some 6.4 percent of the population of Victoria and its surrounding area are more than 80 years of agethe highest proportion for any of Canada's metropolitan areas. The city also boasts the country's third-highest concentration of people 65 and older (17.8 per cent), behind only Peterborough, Ontario, and Kelowna, British Columbia.[37] Retirees throughout Canada are drawn to Victoria's mild climate, beautiful scenery, year-round golf season, and generally easy-going pace of life. A historically popular clich referring to the city was that it is for \\"the newly wed and nearly dead\\".[38]\\r\\nNote: These categories are those used by Statistics Canada.\\r\\nThe city's chief industries are technology, food products, tourism, education, federal and provincial government administration and services.[citation needed] Other nearby employers include the Canadian Forces (the Township of Esquimalt is the home of the Pacific headquarters of the Royal Canadian Navy), and the University of Victoria (located in the municipalities of Oak Bay and Saanich) and Camosun College (which have over 33,000 faculty, staff and students combined). Other sectors of the Greater Victoria area economy include: investment and banking, online book publishing, various public and private schools, food products manufacturing, light aircraft manufacturing, technology products, various high tech firms in pharmaceuticals and computers, engineering, architecture and telecommunications.\\r\\nAdvanced technology is Victoria's largest revenue producing private industry with $3.15 billion in annual revenues generated by more than 880 tech companies that have over 15,000 direct employees.[44] The annual economic impact of the sector is estimated at more than $4.03 billion per year.[44] With three post secondary institutions, eight federal research labs, and Canada's Pacific Navy Base, Victoria has many of the elements required for a strong technology sector. Victoria has Canada's highest household internet usage and is ranked as \\"Canada's Smartest City\\" by Macleans Magazine.[45]\\r\\nVictoria is a major tourism destination with over 3.5 million overnight visitors per year who add more than a billion dollars to the local economy.[46] As well, an additional 500,000 daytime visitors arrive via cruise ships which dock at Ogden Point near the city's Inner Harbour. Many whale watching tour companies operate from this harbour due to the whales often present near its coast. The city is also close to Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt, the Canadian Navy's primary Pacific Ocean naval base. Downtown Victoria also serves as Greater Victoria's regional downtown, where many night clubs, theatres, restaurants and pubs are clustered, and where many regional public events occur. Canada Day fireworks displays, Symphony Splash, and many other music festivals and cultural events draw tens of thousands of Greater Victorians and visitors to the downtown core. The Rifflandia and Electronic Music Festival are other music events that draw crowds to the downtown core.\\r\\nThe city and metro region has hosted high-profile sports events including the 1994 Commonwealth Games, the 2009 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the 2005 Ford World Men's Curling Championship tournament, and 2006 Skate Canada. Victoria co-hosted the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup at Royal Athletic Park, and is the venue for the Bastion Square Grand Prix Criterium road cycling race. The city is also a destination for conventions, meetings, and conferences, including a 2007 North Atlantic Treaty Organization military chief of staff meeting held at the Hotel Grand Pacific. Every year, the Swiftsure International Yacht Race attracts boaters from around the world to participate in the boat race in the waters off of Vancouver Island, and the Victoria Dragon Boat Festival brings over 90 teams from around North America. The Tall Ships Festival brings sailing ships to the city harbour. Victoria also hosts the start of the Vic-Maui Yacht Race, the longest offshore sailboat race on the West Coast.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Port of Victoria consists of three parts, the Outer Harbour, used by deep sea vessels, the Inner and Upper Harbours, used by coastal and industrial traffic. It is protected by a breakwater with a deep and wide opening. The port is a working harbour, tourist attraction and cruise destination. Esquimalt Harbour is also a well-protected harbour with a large graving dock and shipbuilding and repair facilities.\\r\\nIn January 2005, a volunteer study by the Victoria Cool Aid Society found the homeless population to be approximately 700 individuals.[47] This was the first homeless count in the city. In 2006, a Times-Colonist news article estimated the homeless population to have increased by 30% in just a few weeks due to the anticipated tourism boom of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.[48] In early 2008, an anti-homelessness programme based on a successful Italian programme was introduced to Victoria.[49] As of February 2013, no residents live there yet.[50]\\r\\nDespite Victoria's reputation as a tourist destination, pervasive homelessness and panhandling are serious problems in the downtown area, as is \\"open-air\\" drug use.[51][52][53][54][55]\\r\\nThe homeless survey conducted by the Victoria Cool-Aid Society found 50% of the homeless population identify themselves as being of First Nations origin, and the majority of people living on the streets do not receive income assistance from the government.[47]\\r\\nMayfair Shopping Centre is a mall located in Victoria, British Columbia. Mayfair, one of the first major shopping centres in Victoria, first opened as an outdoor strip mall on 16 October 1963 with 27 stores.[56][60] It was built on the site of a former brickyard in the Maywood district, a then-semi-rural area in the northern part of Victoria.[60][61] Woodward's was Mayfair's original department store anchor upon the mall's opening.[60][62]\\r\\nMayfair was enclosed and renovated into an indoor mall in 1974.[63][64] The mall underwent three later expansions in 1984 (with the addition of Consumers Distributing), 1985 (expansion of the mall food court) and a major expansion in 1990 that saw the addition of more retail space.[63] The Bay (now Hudson's Bay) replaced Woodward's as Mayfair's department store anchor in 1993 following Hudson's Bay Company's acquisition of the Woodward's chain.[65]\\r\\nMayfair now offers 117 stores and services including Hudson's Bay and Toys \\"R\\" Us.[58] It has 454,213 square feet (42,197.8?m2) of retail space and it also provides customers with rooftop parking.[58]\\r\\nThe Victoria Symphony, led by Tania Miller, performs at the Royal Theatre and the Farquhar Auditorium of the University of Victoria from September to May. Every BC Day weekend, the Symphony mounts Symphony Splash, an outdoor event that includes a performance by the orchestra sitting on a barge in Victoria's Inner Harbour. Streets in the local area are closed, as each year approximately 40,000 people attend a variety of concerts and events throughout the day. The event culminates with the Symphony's evening concert, with Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture as the grand finale, complete with cannon fire from Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Gunners from HMCS QUADRA, a pealing carillon and a fireworks display to honour BC Day. Pacific Opera Victoria, Victoria Operatic Society, Victoria Philharmonic Choir, Canadian Pacific Ballet and Ballet Victoria stage two or three productions each year at the Macpherson or Royal Theatres.\\r\\nThe annual multi-day Rifflandia Music Festival is one of Canada's largest modern, rock and pop music festivals.\\r\\nThe Bastion Theatre, a professional dramatic company, functioned in Victoria through the 1970s and 1980s and performed high quality dramatic productions but ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1988. Reborn as The New Bastion Theatre in 1990 the company struggled for two more years before closing operations in 1992.\\r\\nThe Belfry Theatre started in 1974 as the Springridge Cultural Centre in 1974. The venue was renamed the Belfry Theatre in 1976 as the company began producing its own shows. The Belfry's mandate is to produce contemporary plays with an emphasis on new Canadian plays.\\r\\nOther regional theatre venues include: Phoenix Theatre student theatre at the University of Victoria, Kaleidoscope Theatre and Intrepid Theatre, producers of the Victoria Fringe Theatre Festival and The Uno Festival of Solo Performance.\\r\\nThe only Canadian Forces Primary Reserve brass/reed band on Vancouver Island is located in Victoria. The 5th (British Columbia) Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery Band traces its roots back to 1864, making it the oldest, continually operational military band west of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Its mandate is to support the island's military community by performing at military dinners, parades and ceremonies, and other events. The band performs weekly in August at Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Site where the Regiment started manning the guns of the fort in 1896, and also performs every year at the Cameron Bandshell at Beacon Hill Park.\\r\\nThe current major sporting and entertainment complex, for Victoria and Vancouver Island Region, is the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre arena. It replaced the former Victoria Memorial Arena, which was constructed by efforts of World War II veterans as a monument to fallen comrades. World War I, World War II, Korean War, and other conflict veterans are also commemorated. Fallen Canadian soldiers in past, present, and future wars and/or United Nations, NATO missions are noted, or will be noted by the main lobby monument at the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre. The arena was the home of the ECHL (formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League) team, Victoria Salmon Kings, owned by RG Properties Limited, a real estate development firm that built the Victoria Save On Foods Memorial Centre, and Prospera Place Arena in Kelowna. The arena is the home of the Victoria Royals Western Hockey League (WHL) team that replaced the Victoria Salmon Kings (ECHL).\\r\\nA number of well-known musicians and bands are from Victoria, including Nelly Furtado, David Foster, The Moffatts, Frog Eyes, Johnny Vallis, Jets Overhead, Bryce Soderberg, Swollen Members, Armchair Cynics, Nomeansno, The New Colors, Wolf Parade, The Racoons, Dayglo Abortions and Hot Hot Heat. Due to the proximity to Vancouver and a 6% distance location tax credit, Victoria is used as a filming location for many films, television series, and television movies. Some of these films include X2, X-Men: The Last Stand, In the Land of Women, White Chicks, Scary Movie, Final Destination, Excess Baggage and Bird on a Wire. Television series such as Smallville, The Dead Zone and Poltergeist: The Legacy were also filmed there. Canadian director Atom Egoyan was raised in Victoria. Actors Cameron Bright (Ultraviolet, X-Men: The Last Stand, Thank You for Smoking, New Moon) and Ryan Robbins (Stargate Atlantis, Battlestar Galactica, Sanctuary) were born in Victoria. Actor Cory Monteith from the television series Glee was raised in Victoria. Actor, artist, and athlete Duncan Regehr of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was raised in the region.\\r\\nNobel laureate Alice Munro lived in Victoria during the years when she published her first story collections and co-founded Munro's Books. Victoria resident Stanley Evans has written a series of mysteries featuring a Coast Salish character, Silas Seaweed, who works as an investigator with the Victoria Police Department.

Its area of 75 hectares (190 acres) adjacent to Victoria's southern shore includes numerous playing fields, manicured gardens, exotic species of plants and animals such as wild peacocks, a petting zoo, and views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Olympic Mountains in Washington across it. The sport of cricket has been played in Beacon Hill Park since the mid-19th century.[66] Each summer, the City of Victoria presents dozens of concerts at the Cameron Band Shell in Beacon Hill Park. [67]\\r\\nThe extensive system of parks in Victoria also includes a few areas of natural Garry oak meadow habitat, an increasingly scarce ecosystem that once dominated the region.\\r\\nIn the heart of downtown are the British Columbia Parliament Buildings, The Empress Hotel, Victoria Police Department Station Museum, the gothic Christ Church Cathedral, and the Royal British Columbia Museum/IMAX National Geographic Theatre, with large exhibits on local Aboriginal peoples, natural history, and modern history, along with travelling international exhibits. In addition, the heart of downtown also has the Emily Carr House, Victoria Bug Zoo, and Market Square. The oldest (and most intact) Chinatown in Canada is located within downtown. The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria is located close to downtown in the Rockland neighbourhood several city blocks from Craigdarroch Castle built by industrialist Robert Dunsmuir and Government House, the official residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia.\\r\\nNumerous other buildings of historic importance or interest are also located in central Victoria, including: the 1845 St. Ann's Schoolhouse; the 1852 Helmcken House built for Victoria's first doctor; the 1863 Congregation Emanu-El, the oldest synagogue in continuous use in Canada; the 1865 Angela College built as Victoria's first Anglican Collegiate School for Girls, now housing retired nuns of the Sisters of St. Ann; the 1871 St. Ann's Academy built as a Catholic school; the 1874 Church of Our Lord, built to house a breakaway congregation from the Anglican Christ Church cathedral; the 1890 St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church;[68] the 1890 Metropolitan Methodist Church (now the Victoria Conservatory of Music), [69] which is publicly open for faculty, student, and guest performances, also acts as Camosun College Music Department; the 1892 St. Andrew's Cathedral; and the 1925 Crystal Gardens, originally a saltwater swimming pool, restored as a conservatory and most recently a tourist attraction called the B.C.

There are mountain biking trails at Mount Work Regional Park,[72] and Victoria is quickly becoming a bike tourism destination.[73]\\r\\nCycling advocacy groups including Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition (GVCC) and the Bike To Work Society have worked to improve Victoria's cycling infrastructure and facilities, and to make cycling a viable transportation alternative, attracting 5% of commuters in 2005.[74]\\r\\nThe Jordan River Diversion Dam is Vancouver Island's main hydroelectric power station. It was built in 1911.[75]\\r\\nThe city's water is supplied by the Capital Regional District's Water Services Department from its Sooke Lake Reservoir. The lake is connected to a treatment plant at Japan Gulch by the 8.8?km (5.5?mi) Kapoor Tunnel. The lake water is very soft and requires no filtering. It is treated with chlorine, ammonia and ultraviolet light to control micro-organisms. [76] Until the tunnel was completed in 1967, water flowed from the lake through the circuitous, leaky and much smaller 44?km (27?mi) Sooke Flowline.\\r\\nThe Hartland landfill is the waste disposal site for Greater Victoria area. Since 1985, it has been run by the Capital Regional District environmental services. It is located on top of a hill, between Victoria and Sidney, at the end of Hartland Avenue.483217N 1232748W? / ?48.538148N 123.463368W? / 48.538148; -123.463368 There is a recycling centre, a sewer solid waste collection, hazardous waste collection, and an electricity generating station. This generating station now creates 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough for 1,600 homes.[77] The site has won international environmental awards.[78] The CRD conducts public tours of the facility. It is predicted to be full by 2045.\\r\\nVictoria discharges 81.7 megalitres (2,890,000 cubic feet)[79] per day of screened wastewater that has undergone preliminary treatment into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The wastewater treatment facilities at Clover Pt. and Macaulay Pt. serve seven municipalities composing the core area of the CRD. At these two facilities, wastewater is screened to exclude objects larger than 6?mm (0.24?in) then pumped through diffusers at the end of deep marine outfalls.[80] The CRD is currently building an upgrade of its wastewater treatment infrastructure to full tertiary level.\\r\\nThe Saanich Peninsula wastewater treatment plant serves North Saanich, Central Saanich and the Town of Sidney as well as the Victoria International Airport, the Institute of Ocean Sciences and the Tseycum and Pauquachin First Nations communities. This is a secondary level treatment plant which produces Class A biosolids.[80]\\r\\nLocal public transportation is run by the Victoria Regional Transit System, which is part of BC Transit. Since 2000, double decker buses have been introduced to the fleet and have become an icon for the city. Rider fare payments can be made in cash, monthly bus passes, disability yearly passes, day passes purchased from the driver or tickets purchased from a store. As of April 1, 2016 bus drivers do not provide transfers as proof of payment as they were a source of disagreement and delay on the bus due to improper transfer use and disagreements over expired transfers or transfers used for return trips.[81] Instead a day pass was added that can be purchased from the bus driver for $5 or two bus tickets (purchased from a retailer) for the equivalent of $4.50.[81] To improve bus reliability and reduce delays a bike and bus priority lane was opened in 2014 during peak traffic periods with fines for motorists operating in the bus/bike lane who are not turning in the same block.[82] The dedicated bike and bus lane on Douglas street is being expanded from Downtown to near Uptown and may be changed to be restricted to only buses and bikes 24/7 rather than just during peak traffic periods depending on direction of travel.[83] Most buses operating in the Greater Victoria area have a bike rack installed at the front of the bus that can accommodate two bicycles.[84]\\r\\nCoach bus service between downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver or the Vancouver International Airport that includes the ferry fare is called the BC Ferries Connector run by Wilson's Transportation Limited. The coach bus travels on the ferry to Vancouver with separate trips for the bus to downtown and a bus to the Vancouver International Airport (YVR). Average travel time between the two cities is under 4 hours with an hour and half of that time spent on the ferry crossing.\\r\\nBus service from Victoria to points up island is run by Island Link Bus or Tofino Bus. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal located at 700 Douglas Street, behind the Fairmont Empress Hotel and offer trips to destinations further up island and the west coast of the island.\\r\\nPassenger rail service previously operated by Via Rail provided a single daily return trip along between Victoria ÿ Courtenay, along the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, to the cities of Nanaimo, Courtenay, and points between. The service was discontinued along this line indefinitely on 19 March 2011, due to needed track replacement work.[85][86] Prior to further inspection of the track, service along the segment between Nanaimo and Victoria was originally planned to resume on 8 April, but lack of funding has prevented any of the work from taking place and it is unclear when or if the service will resume.\\r\\nThe Victoria International Airport has non-stop flights to and from Toronto, San Francisco, Seattle and many cities throughout Western Canada. Multiple scheduled helicopter and seaplane flights are available daily from Victoria's Inner Harbour to Vancouver International Airport, Vancouver Harbour, and Seattle.\\r\\nDirect flights between Victoria and the San Francisco Bay Area (San Francisco, Oakland, Silicon Valley) began service on 5 June 2008.[87] Trips will be 2 hours instead of the usual 6 hours because there will be no stop overs in Seattle, as with other flights. The service will be operated by United Airlines, using Bombardier CRJ-200 aircraft. The same newspaper article also mentions the Victoria Airport Authority's plans for further capacity expansions at the Victoria International Airport. These are expected to offer extended economic benefits to the region, especially the Tourism and High Tech industries. West Jet started a direct flight service to Las Vegas, Nevada, three times per week, on 9 September 2008 (Victoria Times Colonist, 29 May 2008).\\r\\nVictoria is also home to the world's largest all-seaplane airline, Harbour Air.[88] Harbour air offers flights during daylight hours at least every 30 minutes between Victoria's inner harbour and Vancouver's downtown terminal or YVR south terminal. Harbour Air also operate scenic tour flights over the Victoria harbour and gulf islands area.[89]\\r\\nLocal roadways, although showing signs of increasing congestion due to increasing population, are relatively easy to travel via a variety of means. However, roads in Victoria are not based on a grid system as in Vancouver or Edmonton, and even most major streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is little distinction between \\"streets\\" and \\"avenues\\" in Victoria as there is in other cities such as Vancouver or Edmonton where \\"streets\\" run north-south and \\"avenues\\" run east-west, and Victorians are unlikely to use the terms \\"north\\", \\"south\\", \\"east\\", or \\"west\\" when giving directions.\\r\\nThe compact size of the city lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as scooters, as areas with significantly steep hills, such as one would find in San Francisco, are very few. Victoria is also in the process of making the use of such methods of transportation more desirable (in a push towards a more \\"green\\", eco-friendly environment), by offering incentives to use such modes of transport, such as parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designed for vehicles \\"3?m (9?ft 10?in) or less\\" in wheelbase size, thus fostering the desirability for ownership of vehicles such as Smart Cars, motorcycles and small displacement scooters. Generally speaking, one can expect to reach most destinations within Greater Victoria within a time span of 20 ÿ 30 minutes, perhaps approximately 60 minutes, dependent on traffic conditions, road construction or other reasons for blockage, where you are coming from, going to, and mode of transport. Travel time is longer during rush hour times due to large volume of traffic entering the downtown core in the morning and departing at evening rush hour.\\r\\nVictoria also serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada's Trans-Canada Highway, the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero is located in the southern part of the city at the corner of Douglas Street and Dallas Road, where there is a small sign to mark the spot and a statue to honour Terry Fox.\\r\\nWithin the Greater Victoria area, private cars, SUVs, and light trucks together make up the majority of trips. However, the city boasts an excellent public transit system using a fleet of modern buses, and is beginning to plan for a rapid transit link to the suburban/rural western communities of Langford, Colwood, Metchosin and Sooke.\\r\\nDue to Victoria's mild year round weather with mostly rainy winters, commuting by bicycle is practical year-round as compared to other Canadian cities. For this reason, the Greater Victoria area had the highest rate of bicycle commuting to work of any census metropolitan region in Canada in the 2011 census.[90] Greater Victoria also has an expanding system designed to facilitate bicycles and electrically assisted bicycles via bike lanes on many roads as well as separated multi-use paths for bicycles and pedestrians known as the Galloping Goose Regional Trail, Lochside Regional Trail and the E&N rail trail. These multi-use trails are designed exclusively for foot traffic and cyclists and pass through many communities in the Greater Victoria area, beginning at the downtown core and extending into areas such as Langford and Central and North Saanich.\\r\\nBike to Work Week Victoria[91][92][93] is a bi-annual event held in communities throughout greater Victoria, British Columbia. It is organized by the Greater Victoria Bike to Work Society with a Spring bike to work week scheduled in late May every year and a Fall bike to work week scheduled in October. The purpose of the event is to encourage bicycle commuting. Bike to Work Week began in 1995 in Victoria and has expanded to include other communities in BC through their local bicycle advocacy groups all supported by the Bike to Work BC Society. In 2008, the Bike to Work BC Society was formed as a legal entity to run the event in other communities around BC. Since its inception ridership in the yearly event has steadily increased, and in 2011 over 7000 people participated in Greater Victoria. Bike to Work Week is first a marketing initiative and secondarily a cycling event that aims to attract new daily riders to commuting by bicycle. The behaviour change (public health) model, relying on research conducted by both the provincial and federal governments that identified barriers to cycling and reasons for choosing cycling, was applied as a way to accomplish the goal of recruiting employees to bicycle to work.[94]\\r\\nVictoria is building a protected bike lane network with the first lane to open in Spring 2017 on Pandora Avenue, between Store Street and Cook Street in the downtown core.[95] The final protected lane will make for an easy cycling connection for commuters across the soon to be constructed, new Johnson Street bridge, to the Gallopping Goose trail and E&N rail trail when connected fully.\\r\\nVictoria is served by several ferries with the Lower Mainland, Gulf Islands and the United States. BC Ferries provides service between Swartz Bay, up the Saanich peninsula from Victoria, to Tsawwassen on the Lower Mainland for cars, bus, trucks, pedestrians and cyclists. The Coho ferry operates as a car and pedestrian/cyclist ferry between the inner harbour of Victoria and Port Angeles, Washington.The Victoria Clipper is a passenger-only (no vehicles) ferry which operates daily, year-round between downtown Seattle and the inner harbour of Victoria. The Washington State Ferries runs a ferry for cars, pedestrians and cyclists between Friday Harbour, Orcas Island and Anacortes in Washington State from the port at Sidney, up the Saanich peninsula from Victoria.[96]\\r\\nThe city of Victoria lies entirely within the Greater Victoria School District. There is one public high school located within the city boundaries, Victoria High School, founded in 1876, making it the oldest High School in North America north of Portland, Oregon and west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Most of the elementary schools in Victoria now offer the popular French immersion programmes in addition to programmes in English. The educational needs of the Francophone community in Victoria are served by cole Victor-Brodeur in the adjacent municipality of Esquimalt. In addition, within the city proper there are several smaller schools serving segments of the community such as the Chinese School in Chinatown and Christ Church Cathedral School. The senior campus of Glenlyon-Norfolk School is located in the Oak Bay neighbourhood.\\r\\nThe Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, operates one Francophone school in the Victoria area: cole Victor-Brodeur in Esquimalt. It is a M-12 primary and secondary school.[97]\\r\\nVictoria is served by three public post secondary educational institutions located outside the city in the Greater Victoria area: University of Victoria (UVic), Camosun College, and Royal Roads University (RRU). The University of Victoria is located on the Saanich, Oak Bay border. Camosun College has two campuses, both of which are located in Saanich. Royal Roads University is located in Colwood.\\r\\nLester B. Pearson College of the Pacific is an international school, in Metchosin, a municipality to the west of Victoria. There are also several private vocational and English (ESL) training schools available for people who want to learn the English language or upgrade new job market skills. Sprott Shaw College is a private career training institution that has had a campus in Victoria since 1913.\\r\\nVictoria is the only Canadian provincial capital without a local CBC Television station, owned-and-operated or affiliate, although it does host a small CBC Radio station in the 700 block of Kings Road. The region is considered to be a part of the Vancouver television market, receiving most stations that broadcast from across the Strait of Georgia, including the CBC, CTV, City and Global affiliates. The two television stations based in Victoria are CHEK-DT (an independent station) and CIVI-DT (a CTV Two affiliate).\\r\\nVictoria has four Sister Cities:[100]\\r\\nCoordinates: 482519N 1232154W? / ?48.422N 123.365W? / 48.422; -123.365?

It is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about 800 meters south-east of the Duomo. The site, when first chosen, was in marshland outside the city walls. It is the burial place of some of the most illustrious Italians, such as Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli, the poet Foscolo, the philosopher Gentile and the composer Rossini, thus it is known also as the Temple of the Italian Glories (Tempio dell'Itale Glorie).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basilica is the largest Franciscan church in the world. Its most notable features are its sixteen chapels, many of them decorated with frescoes by Giotto and his pupils, and its tombs and cenotaphs. Legend says that Santa Croce was founded by St Francis himself. The construction of the current church, to replace an older building, was begun on 12 May 1294,[1] possibly by Arnolfo di Cambio, and paid for by some of the city's wealthiest families. It was consecrated in 1442 by Pope Eugene IV. The building's design reflects the austere approach of the Franciscans. The floorplan is an Egyptian or Tau cross (a symbol of St Francis), 115 metres in length with a nave and two aisles separated by lines of octagonal columns. To the south of the church was a convent, some of whose buildings remain.\\r\\nThe Primo Chiostro, the main cloister, houses the Cappella dei Pazzi, built as the chapter house, completed in the 1470s. Filippo Brunelleschi (who had designed and executed the dome of the Duomo) was involved in its design which has remained rigorously simple and unadorned.\\r\\nIn 1560, the choir screen was removed as part of changes arising from the Counter-Reformation and the interior rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari. As a result, there was damage to the church's decoration and most of the altars previously located on the screen were lost.\\r\\nThe bell tower was built in 1842, replacing an earlier one damaged by lightning. The neo-Gothic marble fa?ade dates from 1857-1863. The Jewish architect Niccolo Matas from Ancona, designed the church's fa?ade, working a prominent Star of David into the composition. Matas had wanted to be buried with his peers but because he was Jewish, he was buried under the threshold and honored with an inscription.\\r\\nIn 1866, the complex became public property, as a part of government suppression of most religious houses, following the wars that gained Italian independence and unity.[2][3]\\r\\nThe Museo dell'Opera di Santa Croce is housed mainly in the refectory, also off the cloister. A monument to Florence Nightingale stands in the cloister, in the city in which she was born and after which she was named. Brunelleschi also built the inner cloister, completed in 1453.\\r\\nIn 1966, the Arno River flooded much of Florence, including Santa Croce. The water entered the church bringing mud, pollution and heating oil. The damage to buildings and art treasures was severe, taking several decades to repair.\\r\\nToday the former dormitory of the Franciscan friars houses the Scuola del Cuoio (Leather School).[4] Visitors can watch as artisans craft purses, wallets, and other leather goods which are sold in the adjacent shop.\\r\\nArtists whose work is present in the church include:\\r\\nOnce present in the church's Medici Chapel, but now split between the Florentine Galleries and the Bagatti Valsecchi Museum in Milan, is a polyptych by Lorenzo di Niccol.\\r\\nThe Basilica became popular with Florentines as a place of worship and patronage and it became customary for greatly honoured Florentines to be buried or commemorated there. Some were in chapels \\"owned\\" by wealthy families such as the Bardi and Peruzzi. As time progressed, space was also granted to notable Italians from elsewhere. For 500 years monuments were erected in the church including those to:\\r\\nA Room with a View (1908), E.M.

One of the most successful sports car lines ever produced, the trend-setting S30 was designed by a team led by Yoshihiko Matsuo, the head of Nissan's Sports Car Styling Studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeking to compete head-to-head with established European sports cars, Datsun priced the new 240Z within $200 of the British MGB-GT in the United States, a five year-old design that showed its age. The 240Z's sleek styling, modern engineering, relatively low price, and impressive performance struck a major chord with the public. Positive response from both buyers and the motoring press was immediate, and dealers soon had long waiting lists for the \\"Z\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a \\"halo\\" car, the 240Z broadened the acceptance of Japanese car-makers beyond their econobox image. Datsun's growing dealer network compared to limited production imported sports cars manufactured by Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, Alfa Romeo, and Fiat ensured both easy purchase and ready maintenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll variants of the S30 have four-wheel independent suspension consisting of MacPherson struts in front (borrowed from the Nissan Laurel C30) and Chapman struts in back. Front disc brakes and rear drums were standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 240Z used twin SU-style Hitachi one-barrel side-draft carburetors. These were replaced on the 260Z with Hitachi one-barrel side-draft carburetors beginning with model year 1973 to comply with emissions regulations, resulting in diminished overall performance. A Bosch designed L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection was added to US market 280Zs in 1975 to compensate.\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuing through the 1975ÿ1978 model years, other non-US markets still received the 260Z coupe and the 260Z 2+2 hatchback  the two-door, four-seat model. The S30 240Z is unrelated to the later 240SX, which is sold as the Silvia in Japan, although initial advertising for the 240SX mentioned the S30.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1970 240Z was introduced to the American market by Yutaka Katayama, president of Nissan Motors USA operations, widely known as \\"Mister K\\". The 1970 through the mid-1971 model year 240Z was referred to as the Series I. These early cars had many subtle but notable features differing from later cars. The most easily visible difference is that these early cars had a chrome 240Z badge on the sail pillar, and two horizontal vents in the rear hatch below the glass molding providing flow through ventilation. In mid-1971, for the Series II 240Z-cars, the sail pillar emblems were restyled with just the letter Z placed in a circular vented emblem, and the vents were eliminated from the hatch panel of the car. Design changes for the US model 240Z occurred throughout production, including interior modifications for the 1972 model year, and a change in the location of the bumper over-riders, as well as the addition of some emission control devices and the adoption of a new style of emissions reducing carburetors for the 1973 model year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japan, it was exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealerships called Nissan Bluebird Stores, and was first introduced in Japan in 1969.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1970 models were introduced in October 1969, received the L24 2.4-liter engine with a manual choke and a four-speed manual. A less common three-speed automatic transmission was optional from 1971 on, and had a \\"Nissan full automatic\\" badge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, Sports Car International named this car number two on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, a 240Z, in the hands of Shekhar Mehta, won the 21st East African Safari Rally.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 260Z was sold in the United States for the 1974 model year only, but was available in other countries until 1978. The engine was enlarged .2 L to 2.6?L by lengthening its stroke. In the US, federal emissions regulations forced a reduction in ignition timing and compression ratio, resulting in a lower power output (140?hp)[citation needed] for the 260Z despite the additional displacement, whereas in other countries the power output increased to 165?bhp (123?kW; 167?PS). There was also a 1974.5 model sold through the second half of 1974 in the US that had the full 165?bhp (123?kW; 167?PS) with the addition of the larger 5?mph safety bumpers, that would become the standard for the 280Z.\\r\\n\\r\\nA four-speed or 5 speed (non US) manual remained standard equipment, with a three-speed automatic transmission optional.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2+2 model built on a 11.9?in (302?mm) longer wheelbase was introduced, with larger opening quarter panel windows and a slightly notched roofline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 260Z claimed a few updates and improvements over the 240Z. The climate controls were more sensibly laid out and easier to work, and those cars with air conditioning now had the A/C system integrated into the main climate control panel. There was also additional stiffness in the chassis due to a redesign of the chassis rails which were larger and extended further back than previous models. A rear sway bar was added as well. The 260Z debuted a redesigned dashboard and console, as well as new seat trim, and door panels for the interior.  The tail lights were updated, moving the back up lights from the main tail light housing to the back panel.  Early 1974 US 260Z models had bumpers that resembled those of the earlier 240Z, though increased slightly in size, pushed away from the body somewhat, and wearing black rubber bumper guards rather that the previous chrome bumper guards with rubber strips.  These early cars still had the front turn signals located below the bumpers. Late 1974 U.S. 260Z models (often referred to as 1974.5 models) carried the heavier bumpers that would remain on the 1975-76 model years of the 280Z so as to be in compliance with United States bumper legislation in 1973. These late cars had the front turn signals relocated to the outer edges of the front grill, above the bumper.\\r\\n\\r\\nNissan released the Datsun 280Z model for the U.S. market in the 1975 model year. In a further effort to keep the S30 models sporting in the face of increasingly stringent U.S. emission and safety requirements, engine size was again increased, this time to 2.8 L.  The L26 engine was bored out .2 L to create the L28, and a Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection system was added.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1975 and 1976 models continued to be fitted with the U.S. federally-required 5?mph (8.0?km/h) impact absorbing bumpers that were introduced for the mid-1974 model year of the 260Z. These bumpers were smooth surfaced, and blended into smooth black rubber extensions as they met the body of the car. The 1977 and 1978 models received bumpers with recessed channels added that blended into corrugated- or accordion-style black rubber extension trim. Also new for the 1977 model year, 280Zs no longer received the full-size spare tire, and instead had a \\"space saver\\" spare and a larger fuel tank. This resulted in a raised rear deck area made of fiberboard, reducing cargo space. In 1977ÿ78 an optional five-speed manual transmission was available alongside the four-speed manual and the three-speed automatic options. It included a \\"5-speed\\" emblem on the left bottom edge of the rear hatch.  For 1977 there was also an update from the charcoal painted hubcap style (with a chrome Z floating in the amber center emblems) to a hubcap that resembled an alloy wheel, bearing a center cap with a chrome Z floating in a black circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977 and 1978 respectively, Datsun offered two special edition models. The \\"Zap\\" edition was offered in 1977 as a \\"special decor package\\". Zap cars were finished in \\"sunshine yellow\\" paint, and sported black stripes down the center and sides, with yellow, red, and orange chevrons at the front ends of the stripes. An estimated 1,000 \\"Zap Z\\" cars were offered in 1977. The \\"Zap Z\\" model was also used as the pace car in the 1977 Long Beach Gran Prix. The Black Pearl edition (produced in 1978) came with black pearlescent paint and a \\"special appearance package\\" (SAP), which consisted of dual racing mirrors, rear window louvers, and a unique red and silver stripe. It is estimated that between 750-1,500 of these cars were produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo-seat coupe 280Zs remained available throughout the 1975ÿ1978 model year run of the 280Z. The S30 series was replaced in 1979 by the Nissan S130.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fairlady Z was introduced in late 1969 as a 1970 model, with the L20 2.0-litre straight-6 SOHC engine, rear-wheel drive, and a stylish coupe body. The engine, based on the Datsun 510's 4-cylinder, produced 130?hp (96?kW) and came with a 4-speed manual transmission\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japan-only HS30-H Nissan Fairlady ZG was released in Japan in October 1971 to homologate the 240Z for Group 4 racing. Differences between the Fairlady ZG and an export market Datsun 240Z include an extended fiberglass aero-dyna nose, wider over-fenders riveted to the body, a rear spoiler, acrylic glass headlight covers and fender-mounted rear-view mirrors. The Fairlady ZG was available in three colours: Grande Prix Red, Grande Prix White and Grande Prix Maroon. The \\"G\\" in Fairlady ZG stands for \\"Grande.\\" Although the ZG was not sold in the USA and was never sold outside Japan, in order for it to be eligible for competition in the U.S., Nissan sold the nose kit as a dealer's option which is known as the \\"G-nose\\". With the nose added, these 240Zs are often referred to as 240ZGs, outside Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nPackaging the 160?hp (119?kW) S20 engine (originally designed by the former Prince engineers) from the Skyline GT-R created a faster Fairlady. The Z432 (PS30) referred to 4 valves per cylinder, 3 Mikuni carburetors, and 2 camshafts. Approximately 420 were built.[6] Some were used by the police in Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Japan-only model Fairlady Z equipped with the twin cam 2.0?L inline 6-cylinder \\"S20\\" engine shared with the KPGC10 Skyline GT-R was released in the JDM Market for homologation purposes (the car was a rally car). The Z432R was orange with black aluminum wheels and a low luster black hood. Z432R had lighter front guards, doors, and bonnet, as well as further engine enhancements compared to the Z432.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Z was very successful in SCCA racing in the 1970s: Bob Sharp Racing out of Wilton, Connecticut with Sharp, Elliot Forbes-Robinson and later Paul Newman as some of his drivers; and Brock Racing Enterprises (BRE) in the western US with John Morton driving a Datsun 510 and 240Z (#46). Other drivers, such as Clearwater Florida (and later Maryland) racer Don Kearney had much success with the Z-car between 1970 and 1978. The Z is also credited as a catalyst for the import performance parts industry. Nissan also supported and was associated with Bob Bondurant's race driving school from its inception.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 Nissan claimed its 97th SCCA national championship victory with Greg Ira at the wheel of his orange #2 RevTech 240Z.[7] On his way to his championship Ira set several road course records in SCCA's E Production class, beginning in 2006, including:\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\tDaytona International Speedway, Florida[8]\\r\\n?\\tHeartland Park, Kansas\\r\\n?\\tHomestead-Miami Speedway, Florida\\r\\n?\\tPalm Beach International Raceway, Florida\\r\\n?\\tRoad America, Wisconsin\\r\\n?\\tSebring International Raceway, Florida\\r\\n?\\tVirginia International Raceway, Virginia[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIra was awarded SCCA's prestigious Kimberly Cup in 2008.[10] Previous Kimberly Cup recipients include Bob Holbert, Roger Penske, Mark Donohue, and Peter Revson.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 27, 2015, Greg Ira won his second (and Nissan's 98th) SCCA National Championship, in his EP2 Revtech/Ztrix.com 240Z, at Daytona International Speedway.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1997 to 2002, Nissan did not offer the Z-car line except in Japan where they sold the 300ZX (Z32) until 2000 as the Fairlady Z. In 1998, Nissan launched a program to bring back the Z-car line by first purchasing original 240Zs, then restoring them to factory specifications, and finally selling them to dealerships for $24,000. This was an effort to keep Z-car interest alive. Nissan over-estimated the market for the cars and low demand (and the high price) meant that less than fifty cars were re-manufactured and sold.  Furthermore, in 1999, a concept car was shown to the public in a plan to return to the fundamentals that made the 240Z a market success.","input":"What was the first year of the datsun 280z?"},{"output":"Massachusetts","context":"","input":"What state did lexington and concord take place?"},{"output":"Jesuit Pedro Pez","context":"The Nile River (Arabic: ??????, Egyptian Arabic?en-Nؐl, Standard Arabic?an-Nؐl; Coptic: ?????, P(h)iaro; Ancient Egyptian:??'pؐ and Jtrw; Biblical Hebrew: ?????????, Ha-Ye'or or ???????????, Ha-Shi?or) is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa, and is commonly regarded as the longest river in the world,[1] though some sources cite the Amazon River as the longest.[2] The Nile, which is 6,853?km (4,258?miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan and Egypt.[3] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.[4]\\r\\nThe Nile River has two major tributaries, the White Nile and Blue Nile. The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile (Amharic: ???, ?bay[5][6]) begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[7] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[8]\\r\\nThe northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan, and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along riverbanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the ancient Egyptian language, the Nile is called ?'pؐ or Iteru (Hapy), meaning \\"river\\". In Coptic, the word ?????, pronounced piaro (Sahidic) or phiaro (Bohairic), means \\"the river\\" (lit. p(h).iar-o \\"the.canal-great\\"), and comes from the same ancient name.\\r\\nThe English name Nile and the Arabic names en-N?l and an-N?l both derive from the Latin Nilus and the Ancient Greek ??.[9][10] Beyond that, however, the etymology is disputed.[10][11] Hesiod at his Theogony refers that Nilus (??) was one of the Potamoi (river gods), son of Oceanus and Tethys.[12] Another possible etymology derives it from a Semitic Nahal, meaning \\"river\\".[13] The standard English names \\"White Nile\\" and \\"Blue Nile\\", to refer to the river's source, derive from Arabic names formerly applied only to the Sudanese stretches which meet at Khartoum.[14]\\r\\nAbove Khartoum, the Nile River is also known as the White Nile, a term also used in a limited sense to describe the section between Lake No and Khartoum. At Khartoum the river is joined by the Blue Nile. The White Nile starts in equatorial East Africa, and the Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia. Both branches are on the western flanks of the East African Rift.\\r\\nThe drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591?sq?mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[16] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the mainstem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\\r\\nThe source of the Nile River is sometimes considered to be Lake Victoria, but the lake has feeder rivers of considerable size. The Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera and hence the most distant source of the Nile River itself.[17] It is either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi,[18] or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.[19] The two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda-Tanzania border.\\r\\nIn 2010, an exploration party[20] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[21] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758?km (4,199?mi).\\r\\nGish Abay is reportedly the place where the \\"holy water\\" of the first drops of the Blue Nile develop.[22]\\r\\nThe Nile River leaves Lake Nyanza (Victoria) at Ripon Falls near Jinja, Uganda, as the Victoria Nile. It flows north for some 130 kilometers (81?mi), to Lake Kyoga. The last part of the approximately 200 kilometers (120?mi) river section starts from the western shores of the lake and flows at first to the west until just south of Masindi Port, where the river turns north, then makes a great half circle to the east and north until Karuma Falls. For the remaining part it flows merely westerly through the Murchison Falls until it reaches the very northern shores of Lake Albert where it forms a significant river delta. The lake itself is on the border of DR Congo, but the Nile River is not a border river at this point. After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the Albert Nile.\\r\\nThe Nile river flows into South Sudan just south of Nimule, where it is known as the Bahr al Jabal (\\"Mountain River\\"[23]). Just south of the town it has the confluence with the Achwa River. The Bahr al Ghazal, itself 716 kilometers (445?mi) long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called Lake No, after which the Nile becomes known as the Bahr al Abyad, or the White Nile, from the whitish clay suspended in its waters. When the Nile floods it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the Aswan Dam in 1970. An anabranch river, the Bahr el Zeraf, flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\\r\\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at Mongalla, South Sudan is almost constant throughout the year and averages 1,048?m3/s (37,000?cu?ft/s). After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the Sudd region of South Sudan. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to evaporation and transpiration. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about 510?m3/s (18,000?cu?ft/s). From here it soon meets with the Sobat River at Malakal. On an annual basis, the White Nile upstream of Malakal contributes about fifteen percent of the total outflow of the Nile River.[24]\\r\\nThe average flow of the White Nile at Lake Kawaki Malakal, just below the Sobat River, is 924?m3/s (32,600?cu?ft/s); the peak flow is approximately 1,218?m3/s (43,000?cu?ft/s) in October and minimum flow is about 609?m3/s (21,500?cu?ft/s) in April. This fluctuation is due to the substantial variation in the flow of the Sobat, which has a minimum flow of about 99?m3/s (3,500?cu?ft/s) in March and a peak flow of over 680?m3/s (24,000?cu?ft/s) in October.[25] During the dry season (January to June) the White Nile contributes between 70 percent and 90 percent of the total discharge from the Nile.\\r\\nBelow Renk the White Nile enters Sudan, it flows north to Khartoum and meets the Blue Nile.\\r\\nThe course of the Nile in Sudan is distinctive. It flows over six groups of cataracts, from the sixth at Sabaloka just north of Khartoum northward to Abu Hamed. Due to the tectonic uplift of the Nubian Swell, the river is then diverted to flow for over 300?km south-west following the structure of the Central African Shear Zone embracing the Bayuda Desert. At Al Dabbah it resumes its northward course towards the first Cataract at Aswan forming the 'S'-shaped Great Bend of the Nile[26] already mentioned by Eratosthenes.[27]\\r\\nIn the north of Sudan the river enters Lake Nasser (known in Sudan as Lake Nubia), the larger part of which is in Egypt.\\r\\nBelow the Aswan High Dam, at the northern limit of Lake Nasser, the Nile resumes its historic course.\\r\\nNorth of Cairo, the Nile splits into two branches (or distributaries) that feed the Mediterranean: the Rosetta Branch to the west and the Damietta to the east, forming the Nile Delta.\\r\\nBelow the confluence with the Blue Nile the only major tributary is the Atbara River, roughly halfway to the sea, which originates in Ethiopia north of Lake Tana, and is around 800 kilometers (500?mi) long. The Atbara flows only while there is rain in Ethiopia and dries very rapidly. During the dry period of January to June, it typically dries up. It joins the Nile approximately 300 kilometers (200?mi) north of Khartoum.\\r\\nThe Blue Nile (Ge'ez ??? ??? ?iqr ?bby (Black Abay) to Ethiopians; Arabic: ????? ???????; transliterated: an-Nؐl al-Azraq) springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[29] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[30] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekez, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season in the summer, however, when rainfall is especially high on the Ethiopian Plateau; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile (Sobat, Blue Nile, Tekez, and Atbarah) have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts the blue Nile dries out completely.[31]\\r\\nThe flow of the Blue Nile varies considerably over its yearly cycle and is the main contribution to the large natural variation of the Nile flow. During the dry season the natural discharge of the Blue Nile can be as low as 113?m3/s (4,000?cu?ft/s), although upstream dams regulate the flow of the river. During the wet season the peak flow of the Blue Nile often exceeds 5,663?m3/s (200,000?cu?ft/s) in late August (a difference of a factor of 50).\\r\\nBefore the placement of dams on the river the yearly discharge varied by a factor of 15 at Aswan. Peak flows of over 8,212?m3/s (290,000?cu?ft/s) occurred during late August and early September, and minimum flows of about 552?m3/s (19,500?cu?ft/s) occurred during late April and early May.\\r\\nThe Bahr al Ghazal and the Sobat River are the two most important tributaries of the White Nile in terms of discharge.\\r\\nThe Bahr al Ghazal's drainage basin is the largest of any of the Nile's sub-basins, measuring 520,000 square kilometers (200,000?sq?mi) in size, but it contributes a relatively small amount of water, about 2?m3/s (71?cu?ft/s) annually, due to tremendous volumes of water being lost in the Sudd wetlands.\\r\\nThe Sobat River, which joins the Nile a short distance below Lake No, drains about half as much land, 225,000?km2 (86,900?sq?mi), but contributes 412 cubic meters per second (14,500?cu?ft/s) annually to the Nile.[32] When in flood the Sobat carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the White Nile's color.[33]\\r\\nThe Yellow Nile is a former tributary that connected the Ouadda? Highlands of eastern Chad to the Nile River Valley c. 8000 to c. 1000 BC.[34] Its remains are known as the Wadi Howar. The wadi passes through Gharb Darfur near the northern border with Chad and meets up with the Nile near the southern point of the Great Bend.\\r\\nThe Nile (iteru in Ancient Egyptian) has been the lifeline of civilization in Egypt since the Stone Age, with most of the population and all of the cities of Egypt resting along those parts of the Nile valley lying north of Aswan. However, the Nile used to run much more westerly through what is now Wadi Hamim and Wadi al Maqar in Libya and flow into the Gulf of Sidra.[35] As sea level rose at the end of the most recent ice age, the stream which is now the northern Nile pirated the ancestral Nile near Asyut,[36] this change in climate also led to the creation of the current Sahara desert, around 3400 BC.[37]\\r\\nThe present Nile is at least the fifth river that has flowed north from the Ethiopian Highlands. Satellite imagery was used to identify dry watercourses in the desert to the west of the Nile. An Eonile canyon, now filled by surface drift, represents an ancestral Nile called the Eonile that flowed during the later Miocene (23ÿ5.3 million years before present). The Eonile transported clastic sediments to the Mediterranean; several natural gas fields have been discovered within these sediments.\\r\\nDuring the late-Miocene Messinian salinity crisis, when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so, the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred metres below world ocean level at Aswan and 2,400?m (7,900?ft) below Cairo.[38] This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment when the Mediterranean was recreated. At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris.\\r\\nLake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda. The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia.\\r\\nThere are two theories about the age of the integrated Nile. One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age, and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.[39]\\r\\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile and the Atbara and Takazze flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into Tertiary times.[40]\\r\\nSalama suggested that during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 million to 2.588 million years ago) a series of separate closed continental basins each occupied one of the major parts of the Sudanese Rift System: Mellut rift, White Nile rift, Blue Nile rift, Atbara rift and Sag El Naam rift.[41] The Mellut Rift Basin is nearly 12 kilometers (7.5?mi) deep at its central part. This rift is possibly still active, with reported tectonic activity in its northern and southern boundaries. The Sudd swamps which form the central part of the basin may still be subsiding. The White Nile Rift System, although shallower than the Bahr el Arab rift, is about 9 kilometers (5.6?mi) deep. Geophysical exploration of the Blue Nile Rift System estimated the depth of the sediments to be 5ÿ9 kilometers (3.1ÿ5.6?mi). These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased, and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them. The Egyptian Nile connected to the Sudanese Nile, which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial headwaters during the current stages of tectonic activity in the Eastern, Central and Sudanese Rift Systems.[42] The connection of the different Niles occurred during cyclic wet periods. The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000ÿ80,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago.\\r\\nThe Greek historian Herodotus wrote that \\"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\\". An unending source of sustenance, it provided a crucial role in the development of Egyptians civilization. Silt deposits from the Nile made the surrounding land fertile because the river overflowed its banks annually. The Ancient Egyptians cultivated and traded wheat, flax, papyrus and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries, and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times.\\r\\nWater buffalo were introduced from Asia, and Assyrians introduced camels in the 7th century BC. These animals were killed for meat, and were domesticated and used for ploughingor in the camels' case, carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods. The Nile was an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. Hapy was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the pharaoh were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god Ra, the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.\\r\\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the 3 cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called Akhet, Peret, and Shemu. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.[43] Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.[43]\\r\\nOwing to their failure to penetrate the sudd wetlands of South Sudan, the upper reaches of the Nile remained largely unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Various expeditions failed to determine the river's source. Agatharcides records that in the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, a military expedition had penetrated far enough along the course of the Blue Nile to determine that the summer floods were caused by heavy seasonal rainstorms in the Ethiopian Highlands, but no European of antiquity is known to have reached Lake Tana.\\r\\nThe Tabula Rogeriana depicted the source as three lakes in 1154.\\r\\nEuropeans began to learn about the origins of the Nile in the 15th and 16th centuries, when travelers to Ethiopia visited Lake Tana and the source of the Blue Nile in the mountains south of the lake. Although James Bruce claimed to be the first European to have visited the headwaters,[45] modern writers give the credit to the Jesuit Pedro Pez. Pez's account of the source of the Nile[46] is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia. It was published in full only in the early 20th century, although it was featured in works of Pez's contemporaries, including Baltazar Tllez,[47] Athanasius Kircher[48] and by Johann Michael Vansleb.[49]\\r\\nEuropeans had been resident in Ethiopia since the late 15th century, and one of them may have visited the headwaters even earlier without leaving a written trace. The Portuguese Jo?o Bermudes published the first description of the Tis Issat Falls in his 1565 memoirs, compared them to the Nile Falls alluded to in Cicero's De Republica.[50] Jer܇nimo Lobo describes the source of the Blue Nile, visiting shortly after Pedro Pez. Telles also used his account.\\r\\nThe White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the Niger River represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example, Pliny the Elder wrote that the Nile had its origins \\"in a mountain of lower Mauretania\\", flowed above ground for \\"many days\\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the Masaesyli, then sank again below the desert to flow underground \\"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\\"[51] A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile's water attracted game such as buffalo.\\r\\nLake Victoria was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when the British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while traveling with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \\"vast expanse of open water\\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after the then Queen of the United Kingdom. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary David Livingstone pushed too far west and entered the Congo River system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the Lake's northern shore.\\r\\nEuropean involvement in Egypt goes back to the time of Napoleon. Laird Shipyard of Liverpool sent an iron steamer to the Nile in the 1830s. With the completion of the Suez Canal and the British takeover of Egypt in the 1870s, more British river steamers followed.\\r\\nThe Nile is the area's natural navigation channel, giving access to Khartoum and Sudan by steamer. The Siege of Khartoum was broken with purpose-built sternwheelers shipped from England and steamed up the river to retake the city. After this came regular steam navigation of the river. With British Forces in Egypt in the First World War and the inter-war years, river steamers provided both security and sightseeing to the Pyramids and Thebes. Steam navigation remained integral to the two countries as late as 1962. Sudan steamer traffic was a lifeline as few railways or roads were built in that country. Most paddle steamers have been retired to shorefront service, but modern diesel tourist boats remain on the river.\\r\\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river, and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the Aswan High Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers's flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile, which are sections of faster-flowing water with many small islands, shallow water, and rocks, which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd wetlands in Sudan also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impede water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to canalize (the Jonglei Canal) to bypass the swamps.[53][54]\\r\\nNile cities include Khartoum, Aswan, Luxor (Thebes), and the Giza?ÿ Cairo conurbation. The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as feluccas. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at Edfu and Kom Ombo along the way. Security concerns have limited cruising on the northernmost portion for many years.\\r\\nA computer simulation study to plan the economic development of the Nile was directed by H. A. W. Morrice and W. N. Allan, for the Ministry of Hydro-power of the Republic of the Sudan, during 1955ÿ1957[55][56][57] Morrice was their Hydrological Adviser, and Allan his predecessor. M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on hydrology transport models, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.\\r\\nDespite the development of many reservoirs, drought during the 1980s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in Lake Nasser. Drought has proven to be a major cause of fatality in the Nile River basin. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group around 170 million people have been affected by droughts in the last century with half a million lives lost.[58] From the 70 incidents of drought which took place between 1900 and 2012, 55 incidents took place in Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania.[58]\\r\\nThe Nile's water has affected the politics of East Africa and the Horn of Africa for many decades. Countries including Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya have complained about Egyptian domination of its water resources. The Nile Basin Initiative promotes a peaceful cooperation among those states.[59][60]\\r\\nSeveral attempts have been made to establish agreements between the countries sharing the Nile waters. It is very difficult to have all these countries agree with each other given the self-interest of each country and their political, strategic, and social differences. On 14 May 2010 at Entebbe, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda signed a new agreement on sharing the Nile water even though this agreement raised strong opposition from Egypt and Sudan. Ideally, such international agreements should promote equitable and efficient usage of the Nile basin's water resources. Without a better understanding about the availability of the future water resources of the Nile River, it is possible that conflicts could arise between these countries relying on the Nile for their water supply, economic and social developments.[4]\\r\\nIn 1951, the American John Goddard together with two French explorers became the first to successfully navigate the entire Nile river from its source in Burundi at the potential headsprings of the Kagera River in Burundi to its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea, a journey of approximately 6800 kilometers. Their 9-month journey is described in the book Kayaks down the Nile.[61] [62]\\r\\nThe White Nile Expedition, led by South African national Hendrik Coetzee, navigated the White Nile's entire length of approximately 3,700 kilometres (2,300?mi). The expedition began at the White Nile's beginning at Lake Victoria in Uganda, on 17 January 2004 and arrived safely at the Mediterranean in Rosetta, four and a half months later.[63] On the 30th of April 2005 a team led by South Africans Peter Meredith and Hendrik Coetzee, following again in the footsteps of John Goddard, navigated the major remote source of the White Nile, the Akagera river that starts as the Ruvyironza in Bururi Province, Burundi, and ends at Lake Victoria, Uganda.\\r\\nIn April 2006, the Ascend the Nile Expedition including two explorers from Britain and one from New Zealand ascended the river from its mouth at Rosetta to one of its sources in Rwanda's Nyungwe Forest. The Team including Cam McLeay, Neil McGrigor and Garth MacIntyre spent 70 days travelling to the Rwandese source of the Nile covering approximately 6800 kilometres. During the Expedition they were ambushed by the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army) lead by the notorious Joseph Kony, however post-attack six months later they returned to complete the expedition. They measured the length of the river with the help of GPS and claimed to have found the furthest source. Due to the unscientific approach of their expedition, their reluctance to release the GPS data, and not having measured the other contender for the true source of the Nile in Burundi, controversy has ensued.\\r\\nThe Blue Nile Expedition, led by geologist Pasquale Scaturro and his partner, kayaker and documentary filmmaker Gordon Brown became the first people to descend the entire Blue Nile, from Lake Tana in Ethiopia to the beaches of Alexandria on the Mediterranean. Their approximately 5,230 kilometres (3,250?mi) journey took 114 days: from 25 December 2003 to 28 April 2004. Though their expedition included others, Brown and Scaturro were the only ones to complete the entire journey.[64] Although they descended whitewater manually the team used outboard motors for much of their journey.\\r\\nOn 29 January 2005 Canadian Les Jickling and New Zealander Mark Tanner completed the first human powered transit of Ethiopia's Blue Nile. Their journey of over 5,000 kilometres (3,100?mi) took five months. They recount that they paddled through two war zones, regions notorious for bandits, and were arrested at gunpoint.[65]\\r\\n[clarification needed] The following bridges cross the Blue Nile and connect Khartoum to Khartoum North:\\r\\nThe following bridges cross the White Nile and connect Khartoum to Omdurman:\\r\\nthe following bridges cross from Omdurman: to Khartoum North:\\r\\nThe following bridges cross to Tuti from Khartoum states three cities\\r\\nOther bridges\\r\\nRiverboat on the Nile, Egypt 1900\\r\\nMarsh along the Nile\\r\\nA river boat crossing the Nile in Uganda\\r\\nMurchison Falls in Uganda, between Lake Victoria and Lake Kyoga\\r\\nThe Nile in Luxor\\r\\nThe river Nile flows through Cairo, here contrasting ancient customs of daily life with the modern city of today.\\r\\nThe following is an annotated bibliography of key written documents for the Western exploration of the Nile.\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n18th century\\r\\n1800ÿ1850\\r\\n1850ÿ1900","input":"Who discovered the source of the nile river?"},{"output":"Hershey, Pennsylvania","context":"The Hershey Company, known until April 2005 as the Hershey Foods Corporation[4] and commonly called Hershey's, is an American company and one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world.

This candy shop was only open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel.[7] After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where in 1886 he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company. The use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful,[8] and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000[8] (equal to $28,788,000 today), and began to concentrate on chocolate manufacturing, stating to people who questioned him, \\"Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing.\\"\\r\\nIn 1896, Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.\\r\\nIn 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, which later came to be known as Hershey, Pennsylvania.[8] The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live. Milton treated the people well and provided leisure activities to make sure the citizens enjoyed themselves. The milk chocolate bars manufactured at this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.\\r\\nIn 1907, he introduced a new candy, bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical-shaped pieces of chocolate that he named \\"Hershey's Kiss\\". Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of aluminum foil, and the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon to the top of the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product.[8] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).\\r\\nLabor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers. A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence, as loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant. By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.\\r\\nShortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War 2. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors.[9]\\r\\nIn June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing \\"Ice Breakers Pacs\\", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.[10]\\r\\nIn September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of \\"milk chocolate\\", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were \\"milk chocolate\\" and \\"made with chocolate\\" to \\"chocolate candy\\" and \\"chocolaty.\\"[11]\\r\\nIn April 2014, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.[12]\\r\\nA 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was scuttled because of objections by the Hershey Trust.[13]\\r\\nHarry Burnett Reese worked at Hershey, beginning in 1917, as a dairyman for the Hershey Farms. In 1921, he went to work in the factory, and by 1925, he had developed an assortment of candies which he sold to department stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, advertised as \\"made in Hershey\\". In 1926, he built his own factory, and in 1941, with the wartime rationing of sugar, Reese focused all of his production resources on his own confectionery specialty, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which required less sugar than most other confections of the time. In 1956, Reese died, leaving the company to his six sons. In June 1963, Hershey Chocolate Corporation acquired Reese's company for $23.3 million at a time when Reese's sales were $14 million annually.[14]\\r\\nIn 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelz International). In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers.[15][16]\\r\\nIn 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.[17] Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012.[18] Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.[19] In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that their Smiths Falls[20][21] and Oakdale[22][23] plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008.[24] Hershey chocolate factory in S?o Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002.\\r\\nHershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.\\r\\nVisitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened,[25] and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.[23]\\r\\nOn September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.[26]\\r\\nIn 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestl, owners of the Rowntree brand. That license would be revoked and revert to Nestl if Hershey is sold.[13] In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer),[27] and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands.[28] Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtam?ki.\\r\\nIn 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).\\r\\nOn July 25, 2002, it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan.[29] Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company. If Hershey was to be sold, the rights to make and market Kit Kat and Rolo products in the U.S. would have reverted to Nestl.\\r\\nIn December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.[30]\\r\\nIn July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger.[31] In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.\\r\\nIn December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[32]\\r\\nIn 2015, Hershey announced that they had acquired Krave Jerky, marking the company's first foray outside of the confectionery market in more than a decade.[33]\\r\\nIn 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company which expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.[34][35]\\r\\nHershey's chocolate is available across the United States, due to their wide network of distribution.[36] They have three mega distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems.[37]\\r\\nHershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program.[41] The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.\\r\\nIn 2015, Hershey announced a commitment with Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.[42]\\r\\nHershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchase, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.[43] Regarding Hershey's corporate practices, the Global Exchange report comments that:\\r\\nHershey has no policies in place to purchase cocoa that has been produced without the use of labor exploitation, and the company has consistently refused to provide public information about its cocoa sources. Additionally, Hershey has made no move to shift to third-party certification for the cocoa that it sources from West Africa. No information is available from Hershey about how the money it has invested in various programs in West Africa has actually impacted reductions in forced, trafficked, and child labor among the suppliers of its cocoa. Finally, Hershey's efforts to further cut costs in its cocoa production has led to a reduction in good jobs in the United States.[44]\\r\\nThe \\"Raise the Bar, Hershey!\\" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America. the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign is to pressure Hershey to commit \\"to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor  from Hershey's cocoa supply\\"; \\"to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified? cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars  making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified? every two years thereafter\\"; and that \\"the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified? by 2022.\\" Pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012 that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line.[45] The Campaign stated that \\"Whole Foods decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain.\\"[45] The same day, Hershey's announced, \\"it will source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa.\\"[46]","input":"Where is the hershey's chocolate factory located?"},{"output":"27 BC","context":"","input":"When did rome cease to be a republic?"},{"output":"Thespis","context":"Thespis (/?Ĳ?sp?s/; Greek: ??; fl. 6th century BC) of Icaria (present-day Dionysos, Greece), according to certain Ancient Greek sources and especially Aristotle, was the first person ever to appear on stage as an actor playing a character in a play (instead of speaking as him or herself).  In other sources, he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThespis was a singer of dithyrambs (songs about stories from mythology with choric refrains). He is credited with introducing a new style in which one singer or actor performed the words of individual characters in the stories, distinguishing between the characters with the aid of different masks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new style was called tragedy, and Thespis was the most popular exponent of it. Eventually, in 534 BC competitions to find the best tragedy were instituted at the City Dionysia in Athens, and Thespis won the first documented competition.  Capitalising on his success, Thespis also invented theatrical touring;[2] he would tour various cities while carrying his costumes, masks and other props in a horse-drawn wagon.\\r\\n\\r\\nTitles of some plays have been attributed to Thespis. But most modern scholars, following the suggestion of Diogenes La?rtius, consider them to be forgeries, some forged by the philosopher Heraclides Ponticus, others by or altered by Christian writers:[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFragments (probably spurious) in A Nauck, Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta (1887).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is implied that Thespis invented acting in the Western world, and that prior to his performances, no one had ever assumed the resemblance of another person for the purpose of storytelling. In fact, Thespis is the first known actor in written plays. He may thus have had a substantial role in changing the way stories were told and inventing theatre as we know it today. In reverence to Thespis, actors in the English-speaking part of the world have been referred to as thespians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThespis was the title character in an 1871 comic opera by W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, the first collaboration between the two men, although the musical score has mostly been lost. The story involves Thespis and his troupe of actors temporarily replacing the Gods of Olympus, while the latter come down to earth to \\"mingle\\" with humanity.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThespis is a 2014 UK film, produced by ACT 2 CAM.\\r\\n\\r\\nA branch of the National Theatre of Greece expressly instituted in 1939 to tour the country is named \\"The Wagon of Thespis\\" (Greek: ?ϫ ?Ѵ?, rma Thspidos) in his honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nA first season episode of the TV series Sports Night was named \\"Thespis\\" and referenced him.","input":"Who was the first known actor to act alone?"},{"output":"the Soviet Union","context":"Since the first human spaceflight by the Soviet Union, citizens of 40 countries have flown in space.

The original format ran for 24 years up to December 2001. A revamped format of the show began nearly one year later, in October 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Top Gear started as a monthly television series produced by BBC Midlands, based at the Pebble Mill Studios, Birmingham and ran in its original format until the end of 2001. The 30 minute programmes had a magazine format, and were transmitted at first to viewers in the Midlands region only. Top Gear and its title were conceived by executive producer Derek Smith.[2] The programme covered motoring related issues, such as new car road tests, fuel economy, safety, the police, speeding, insurance, second hand cars and holiday touring.\\r\\nThe first programme was broadcast on 22 April 1977, on BBC 1 Midlands at 10:15pm.[3][4] It was presented by Angela Rippon and Tom Coyne, who was front man of the local evening news programme, Midlands Today. In the first edition, Angela Rippon drove from Shepherd's Bush in London, to the Pebble Mill studios in Birmingham, reporting on driving conditions en route. Other items covered in the first programme were speed traps, fuel economy, strange new road signs and an interview with the transport minister. There were nine programmes in that initial series.[2]\\r\\nThe BBC network took Top Gear[5][6] and it became a weekly 30 minute BBC Two programme on 13 July 1978. Derek Smith remained as executive producer, as did Angela Rippon as presenter along with co-presenter Barrie Gill. In the first network series, seven of the 10 programmes were sub titled Rippon On The Road, featuring items such as holiday driving, police driver training, the MOT test and a search for a female rally driver. Other items in that series covered drink driving, traffic jams, rust and corrosion, tachographs in lorries, the Le Mans 24 Hour race and the Motor Show.\\r\\nFor the second network series, again of 10 programmes, Angela Rippon continued as main presenter. Reporters included Mike Dornan, Judith Jackson and Barrie Gill. Subjects covered included child car safety, tyres, CB radio, weighing lorries and junior grass track racing. Each week Noel Edmonds tested new cars, while Alec Jones, chief instructor of the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) set a driving problem. In one of the programmes, Edmonds drove his Ford GT40 car round Silverstone.\\r\\nIn 1980, Noel Edmonds took over from Angela Rippon as presenter for two series. From 1980 on, a variety of reporters were regularly used in addition to the three main co presenters Sue Baker, Frank Page, and Chris Goffey. Other reporters included Gill Pyrah and Julia Bradbury. In 1981, William Woollard, formerly of BBC1's science series Tomorrow's World became the programme's main presenter. Phil Franklin and Brian Strachan joined the production team at this time.\\r\\nThe Top Gear team was also responsible for a number of other special programmes including coverage of the bi-annual British Motor Show, London Motorfair, and the Lombard RAC Rally. Its coverage of rallying was the only sport not controlled by BBC Sport in London for many years.\\r\\nThere continued to be two series a year through the 1980s of between seven and nine programmes each. In 1986, after Phil Franklin and executive producer Dennis Adams left the programme Tom Ross took over.\\r\\nIn the five years, Tom Ross ran the programme first as executive producer and then as editor[7] Jon Bentley (more recently a presenter on the Channel 5 technology show The Gadget Show) and Ken Pollock became the show's producers.\\r\\nFrom 1986 to 1991, faced with repeated threats from various channel controllers from the BBC to cancel the programme, Top Gear embarked on subtle changes designed to raise its profile, increase its audience and cover a much wider range of motoring topics. In this period, many new presenters were added, including former Formula One driver Tiff Needell, Tom Boswell and rallying's Tony Mason.\\r\\nTowards the end of 1988, Jeremy Clarkson, was introduced to the presenting list, coming from Performance Car Magazine.[8]\\r\\nTop Gear Rally Report followed the Lombard RAC Rally each November, presented by William Woollard with Sue Baker, Barrie Gill, Steve Lee, Alan Douglas and Tony Mason. Between 1988 and 1991, the programme organised a Rally Quest competition each year in conjunction with Radio Times, to find a new rally driver with the prize being entry into that year's RAC Rally.[9]\\r\\nDespite enduring criticism that it was overly macho, encouraged irresponsible driving behaviour[10] and ignored the environment, the show pulled in huge audiences regularly becoming BBC Two's most viewed programme with audiences over five million from 1988. New features introduced in these years were consumer issues, classic cars, motorbikes, and a wide range of motorsport.\\r\\nIt became hugely influential with motor manufacturers, since a critical word from the Top Gear team could have a severe negative effect on sales. One such example is the original Vauxhall Vectra, of which Clarkson said, \\"I know it's the replacement for the Cavalier. I know. But I'm telling you it's just a box on wheels.\\"[11] However, even more critical statements never affected sales of the Toyota Corolla, and extreme praise did not help the Renault Alpine GTA/A610.\\r\\nBy the end of the spring season of 1991, the editor Tom Ross and the main presenter, William Woollard, left the show. The autumn season of 1991 saw former used car dealer Quentin Willson join the team, and later Michele Newman, who had previously appeared on ITV's Pulling Power.\\r\\nOther presenters of the era included Steve Berry, whose speciality was motorbikes, Janet Trewin, who typically presented hard hitting safety and consumer affairs pieces, and racing driver Vicki Butler-Henderson, who made a one off appearance in 1994, and started presenting the show full time from 1997. In 1999, journalist James May was introduced, and presented the show for its last two years, before transitioning to the new format for its second series in 2003.\\r\\nFollowing many well-known presenters' departures during 1999 to 2000, the Top Gear audience fell from a peak of six million to under three million.[citation needed] In January 1999, following the departure of Clarkson, the programme was jointly presented by Quentin Willson and Kate Humble, who ran an ongoing test[clarification needed] throughout the programme between reports.[12] In July 1999, Brendan Coogan, who had joined a year earlier, left the show after being convicted of drunk driving.[13][14]\\r\\nIn 2000, Jason Barlow, from Channel 4's Driven, joined the existing line up for the final 53 episodes.[15] The programme ran almost continuously between September 2000 to October 2001, and despite regularly being the most watched show on BBC Two, the channel decided the format needed to be dramatically refreshed. However, a special of Top Gear with Jason Barlow being the only remaining presenter  Vicki Butler-Henderson, Tiff Needell and Adrian Simpson having moved to Fifth Gear  was broadcast in 2002, with coverage of the 2002 Birmingham Motor Show from the NEC.\\r\\nIn December 2001, the show was cancelled by BBC bosses in London, and in April 2002 Channel 5 launched Fifth Gear, a car show featuring many of the former Top Gear presenters, including Tiff Needell, Quentin Willson and Vicki Butler-Henderson. The show was produced by former Top Gear producer Jon Bentley. While most of the production team moved from the BBC to Channel 5 to create Fifth Gear. The name change to Fifth Gear was required, as in November 2001, the BBC would not relinquish the rights to the name of Top Gear (the corporation was publishing Top Gear Magazine).[16]\\r\\nJason Barlow was still under contract to the BBC and went on to front the new programme Wrong Car, Right Car, which ran for two series and 23 episodes.\\r\\nAfter the first series of Fifth Gear was completed, the BBC decided to relaunch Top Gear, but in a new studio based format as opposed to the magazine format used until the cancellation. The idea came from producer Andy Wilman and Jeremy Clarkson, who presented the relaunched show with Richard Hammond and Jason Dawe. James May replaced Dawe from the second series onwards of the current format. The pre-cancellation show is referred to as \\"Old Top Gear\\", when mentioned on the new show due to the differences in style.\\r\\nTop Gear was a title sponsor of the 1987 and 1988 Formula One \\"Winter Series\\", the 1990 and 1991 Historic Rally Championships and the 1992 and 1993 British Rally Championships.[9] Due to the success of the main show, other motoring shows on the BBC also carried the Top Gear name including coverage of the British Motor Show, a show dedicated to motorsport, presented by Tiff Needell, Top Gear Motorsport and the Lombard RAC Rally highlights show, presented by William Woollard, Sue Baker and Tony Mason, Top Gear Rally Report.\\r\\nIn September 1993, a spin off magazine, Top Gear Magazine, was launched, featuring articles and columns from the presenters and additional contributors. The magazine soon became the United Kingdom's best selling car magazine. During the 1990s, Top Gear had a radio spin off, the Top Gear Radio Show, presented by Steve Berry, and available on BBC Radio Five Live.[17] In 1991, when joyriding among British youths was at its peak, Top Gear featured a Joy Riding special.[18]\\r\\nIt included an interview with Tyneside woman Joan McVittie, who was actively involved in campaigns against joyriding[19] after her sixteen year old son Mark Wren was killed, when the stolen car in which he was passenger crashed in October 1990.\\r\\nSince the early 1990s, the annual Top Gear J. D. Power Top 100 survey has consulted thousands of residents within the United Kingdom on their car ownership satisfaction. For legal reasons concerning the non commercial nature of the BBC, the actual consultation is now restricted to the magazine format, although the results are still used on the show. The survey is now conducted by Experian.\\r\\nThe video game Top Gear, developed for the Super NES, was unrelated to the television series, and the BBC won a court case blocking its creators from obtaining a trademark for it.[9] After Top Gear's success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of competing programmes were introduced, including Channel 4's driven, ITV's Pulling Power, Granada's Vroom Vroom and BBC World's India's Wheels. Some of the presenters on Driven would go on to present Top Gear.\\r\\nThe show's opening theme music from the very first programme in 1977 was the Allman Brothers Band instrumental \\"Jessica\\" from the album Brothers and Sisters (1973), although remixed versions were used after 1999. For much of the series' lifespan, Elton John's instrumental \\"Out of the Blue\\" from the album Blue Moves (1976) played over the closing credits.\\r\\nThe opening and closing titles music were suggested to executive producer Derek Smith by his son Graham, who had the two albums at home. He played the tracks to his father and was asked to write down the details, so they could be sourced from the record library in the BBC.\\r\\nEach year, Top Gear announced its Car of the Year. Winners have included:\\r\\nNote: The BMW Z3 M Coup was voted \\"Driver's Car of the Year\\", and the Mercedes-Benz S500 was voted \\"Executive Car of the Year\\" for 2000.\\r\\nIn November 1987, the Audi Quattro officially became the Top Gear Car of the Decade.[20]\\r\\nFrom 1994, the magazine conducted a customer satisfaction survey that was published every April, to reveal how satisfying certain cars were to own. The results were announced on the programme, though the full details were only included in the magazine. The Toyota Corolla was winner of the first four surveys, with the Subaru Impreza winning the survey in 1998 and 1999, and the Subaru Legacy in 2000 and 2001.\\r\\nThe lowest ranking cars in the surveys were the Vauxhall Frontera in 1994, Ford Escort in 1995, Lada Samara in both 1996 and 1997, Vauxhall Vectra in 1998, Ford Galaxy in 1999, and the Vauxhall Sintra in 2000 and 2001.\\r\\nIn April 1998, ?koda was rated as the most satisfying brand of car in the survey, and these findings made the headlines  just a few years earlier, the brand had been the butt of many jokes about the sub standard design and quality of earlier cars. The Japanese manufacturers  particularly Subaru, Toyota, Honda and Mazda  also received high ratings in surveys of Top Gear.\\r\\nSimilar praise went to BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Volvo. In contrast, many marques received heavy criticism in the surveys  particularly Lada, Fiat, Vauxhall, Peugeot, Ford and Alfa Romeo.","input":"When was the first episode of top gear aired?"},{"output":"in tropical oceanic waters around the world, excluding the Atlantic Ocean","context":"Hydrophis platurus, commonly known as the yellow-bellied sea snake, yellowbelly sea snake or pelagic sea snake, is a species of snake from the subfamily Hydrophiinae (the sea snakes) found in tropical oceanic waters around the world, excluding the Atlantic Ocean. It was the only member of the genus Pelamis but recent molecular evidence suggests that it is more closely related to the species of the genus Hydrophis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSea snakes are a subfamily (Hydrophiinae) of the venomous Australasian snakes of the family Elapidae. Traditionally, sea snakes and sea kraits were considered to be a part of a single family (Hydrophiidae), but sea kraits have since been placed into a separate subfamily (Laticaudinae) due to their independent evolution into aquatic habitats (i.e., convergent evolution).[4][5]\\r\\nIn 1766, Linnaeus published the original description of the yellow-bellied sea snake, naming it Anguis platura (Anguis meaning snake). In 1803, Daudin created the new genus Pelamis and assigned this species to it, referring to it as Pelamis platuros. In 1842, Gray described what he thought was a new species and called it Pelamis ornata (subsequently P. ornata became a synonym of P. platura). The commonly used genus name Pelamis is derived from the Ancient Greek word for \\"tunny fish\\", which presumably refers to the habitat or what Daudin thought they ate. The specific name platurus is a combination of the Ancient Greek words platys \\"flat\\" and oura \\"tail\\", referring to the flattened tail. The word Pelamis is a feminine noun and means young or small tunny fish. In 1872, Stoliczka introduced the name Pelamis platurus (still the most used scientific name by scientists today), but used the incorrect ending -us instead of -a which a feminine noun requires.[6] A few recent examples exist of scientists' beginning to use the grammatically correct name Pelamis platura, e.g., Bohme 2003 and the Reptile Database with its page headed Pelamis platura (Linnaeus, 1766), which includes an extensive synonymy of the different scientific names which have been used for the yellow-bellied sea snake.[7] The same rules apply for the most recent taxonomic name of Hydrophis platura.\\r\\nTo further complicate the nomenclature, the taxonomic status of sea snakes is still under review, with recent authors suggesting a dismantling of monotypic genera, such as Pelamis, in favour of a single genus, Hydrophis, in order to reduce paraphyly and better reflect phylogenetic relationships.[8]\\r\\nSea snakes are a monophyletic group (Hydrophiinae) that diverged from the front-fanged Australasian venomous snakes (Elapidae) about 10 million years ago.[9][10] The yellow-bellied sea snake is a part of the rapidly radiating Hydrophis group.[11]\\r\\nThe yellow-bellied sea snake, as the name implies, has a distinctive bicolor pattern with a yellow underbelly and brown back, making it easily distinguishable from other sea snake species. Yellow-bellied sea snakes, like many other species of sea snake, are fully adapted to living their whole lives at sea: mating, eating and giving birth to live young (ovoviviparous). Adaptations to aquatic life include the reduced ventral scale size, laterally compressed body and paddle-tail for swimming,[12][13] valved nostrils and palatine seal for excluding seawater, and cutaneous gas exchange for prolonging dive times.[13][14][15] This species can uptake up to 33% of its oxygen requirements through the skin while diving and swimming at the surface of the water.[16] Sea snakes also have a special salt gland located in the lower jaw that was formerly believed to filter out salt from the surrounding seawater[17] but has been found not to be used for that purpose, as sea snakes drink fresh water only.[18]\\r\\nThe body of this snake is compressed, with the posterior less than half the diameter of the neck; the body scales are juxtaposed, subquadrangular in shape, and in 23ÿ47 rows around the thickest part of the body; ventral scales, 264ÿ406 in number, are very small and, if distinct, divided by a longitudinal groove, but usually are indistinguishable from adjacent body scales. The head is narrow, with an elongated snout; head shields are entire, nostrils are superior, and nasal shields are in contact with one another; the prefrontal scale is in contact with second upper labial; one or two preoculars, two or three postoculars, and two or three small anterior temporals are present; seven or eight upper labials are found, with four or five below the eye, but separated from the border by a subocular. Colors of the snake are variable, but most often distinctly bicolored, black above, yellow or brown below, with the dorsal and ventral colors sharply demarcated from one another; ventrally, there may be a series of black spots or bars on the yellow or brown background, or the yellow may extend dorsally so there is only a narrow middorsal black stripe, or a series of black crossbars.[19] Total length for males is up to 720?mm (28?in), for females up to 880?mm (35?in); tail length for males is up to 80?mm (3.1?in), females up to 90?mm (3.5?in).\\r\\nThe yellow-bellied sea snake is one of the most widely distributed snakes in the world.[4] It is completely pelagic and is often observed on oceanic drift lines, using surface currents and storms to move around the ocean.[20] Their distribution appears to be largely determined by favourable water temperatures, oceanic currents and recent formation of land bridges that have blocked farther dispersal.\\r\\nThe yellow-bellied sea snake has an extensive distribution covering the entire tropical Indo-Pacific, as well as extending to Costa Rica, southern California, and northern Peru.[21][22] It is the only sea snake to have reached the Hawaiian Islands.[23] They have also been reported to occur in the Agulhas Current, with specimens found along the coasts of South Africa and Namibia.[24][25]\\r\\nThe sea snake has also been reported in colder waters such as the coasts of southern California, Tasmania, and New Zealand,[26] a country that would otherwise be free of snakes were it not for the infrequent visits of yellow-bellied sea snake and banded sea kraits.[27] These cold water occurrences are believed to be linked with el Ni?o events or severe storms.[28][29][30] They require a minimum of 16ÿ18?C (60.8 to 64.4?F) to survive long term.[31] In October 2015, they were reported and photographed on beaches in Ventura County, California, well outside their normal range, for the first time in 30 years.[28]\\r\\nDespite the warmer waters, yellow-bellied sea snakes are not found around eastern coast of America or the Caribbean. This is due to the land bridge between North and South America (Isthmus of Panama), which formed from about 10 million years ago to 3 million years ago [32] (i.e., continental drift), acting as a dispersal barrier and preventing entry into the Caribbean Sea from the Pacific Ocean. The man-made Panama Canal has not made a crossing of the isthmus possible presumably because it is fresh water. They do not live in the Red Sea because of its excessive salinity .\\r\\nDue to the wide distribution of the species and relative lack of dispersal barriers, it has been assumed that individuals from different localities represent a single breeding population (i.e., high gene flow). However, a study that used haplotype networks in two populations from Costa Rica suggests that shallow genetic population structure exists, which reflects variation in colour patterns (brown and yellow in Golfo de Papagayo and completely yellow in Golfo Dulce).[33]\\r\\nContrary to past beliefs, sea snakes require fresh water to survive and the yellow-bellied sea snake drinks precipitation that forms on the surface of sea water.[34] This species has been reported to survive severe dehydration of up to 7 months during seasonal drought.[35]\\r\\nThey breed in warm waters; they are ovoviviparous with a gestation period around 6 months. According to Ditmars, females bear live young in tidal pools.[36] They move poorly on land due to their smaller belly scales that form a ventral keel.[14] They are sometimes observed in large aggregations of thousands on the surface of the water in oceanic drift lines, which has been proposed as a strategy to catch prey.[37] They hunt by floating on the surface of the water to attract pelagic fish that are seeking shelter; prey are captured via a backwards swimming motion and rapid lunge of the jaws.[20] Heatwole proposed that these snakes find their prey by sensing the vibration generated by fish movement.[38] Fish are subdued by neurotoxic venom and swallowed whole.\\r\\nThe venom of this species is highly potent, like other sea snakes.[39] The subcutaneous LD50 of the venom is 0.067?mg/kg and the venom yield per bite is 1.0ÿ4.0?mg.[40][41]\\r\\nSea snake venom can cause damage to skeletal muscle with consequent myoglobinuria, neuromuscular paralysis or direct renal damage. The venoms of significant species of sea snake are neutralised with Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd (of Melbourne, Australia) sea snake (Enhydrina schistosa) antivenom.[42][43] If that preparation is not available, tiger snake or polyvalent antivenom should be used. No deaths have been recorded from bites in Australian waters.[44][45] The E. schistosa antivenom was tested specifically on Pelamus platurus, and it effectively neutralised the venom.[46]","input":"Where does the yellow bellied sea snake live?"},{"output":"the 1860s","context":"A sewing machine is a machine used to stitch fabric and other materials together with thread. Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790,[1] the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type. In a modern sewing machine the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles and thimbles and other such tools used in hand sewing, automating the process of stitching and saving time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Fredrick Wiesenthal, a German-born engineer working in England was awarded the first British patent for a mechanical device to aid the art of sewing, in 1755. His invention consisted of a double pointed needle with an eye at one end.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1790, the English inventor Thomas Saint invented the first sewing machine design, but he did not successfully advertise or market his invention.[3] His machine was meant to be used on leather and canvas material. It is likely that Saint had a working model but there is no evidence of one; he was a skilled cabinet maker and his device included many practically functional features: an overhanging arm, a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather), a vertical needle bar, and a looper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sewing machine used the chain stitch method, in which the machine uses a single thread to make simple stitches in the fabric. A stitching awl would pierce the material and a forked point rod would carry the thread through the hole where it would be hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, where the cycle would be repeated, locking the stitch.[4] Saint's machine was designed to aid the manufacture of various leather goods, including saddles and bridles, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing ship sails. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it could become a practical proposition. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint's drawings in the London Patent Office, made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the London Science Museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1804, a sewing machine was built by the Englishmen Thomas Stone and James Henderson, and a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan in Scotland.[5] An Austrian tailor, Josef Madersperger, began developing his first sewing machine in 1807. He presented his first working machine in 1814. Having received financial support from his government, the Austrian tailor worked on the development of his machine until 1839 but he couldnt create anything worthwhile. Perhaps the tailor didnt have the technical wit, perhaps technical knowledge, and perhaps ÿ simple luck. But the fact remains that state money was wasted. However, in 1839 he built a machine imitating the weaving process using the chain stitch. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first practical and widely used sewing machine was invented by Barthlemy Thimonnier, a French tailor, in 1829. His machine sewed straight seams using chain stitch like Saint's model, and in 1830, he signed a contract with Auguste Ferrand, a mining engineer, who made the requisite drawings and submitted a patent application. The patent for his machine was issued on 17 July 1830, and in the same year, he opened (with partners) the first machine-based clothing manufacturing company in the world to create army uniforms for the French Army. However, the factory was burned down, reportedly by workers fearful of losing their livelihood following the issuing of the patent.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA model of the machine is exhibited at the London Science Museum. The machine is made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop. The first American lockstitch sewing machine was invented by Walter Hunt in 1832.[7] His machine used an eye-pointed needle (with the eye and the point on the same end) carrying the upper thread and a falling shuttle carrying the lower thread. The curved needle moved through the fabric horizontally, leaving the loop as it withdrew. The shuttle passed through the loop, interlocking the thread. The feed let the machine down, requiring the machine to be stopped frequently and reset up. Hunt eventually lost interest in his machine and sold individual machines without bothering to patent his invention, and only patenting it at a late date of 1854.  In 1842, John Greenough patented the first sewing machine in the United States. The British partners Newton and Archibold introduced the eye-pointed needle and the use of two pressing surfaces to keep the pieces of fabric in position, in 1841.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first machine to combine all the disparate elements of the previous half-century of innovation into the modern sewing machine was the device built by English inventor John Fisher in 1844,  thus a little earlier than the very similar machines  built by  Isaac Merritt Singer  in 1851, and  the lesser known Elias Howe, in 1845. However, due to the botched filing of Fisher's patent at the Patent Office, he did not receive due recognition for the modern sewing machine in the legal disputations of priority with Singer, and it was Singer who won the benefits of the patent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElias Howe's lockstitch machine, invented in 1845\\r\\n\\r\\nElliptic sewing machine with elliptic hook and stationary bobbin, American Institute Fair, 1862\\r\\n\\r\\nSinger treadle machine\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 1880 machine from the Wheeler and Wilson Company\\r\\n\\r\\nElias Howe, born in Spencer, Massachusetts, created his sewing machine in 1845, using a similar method to Fisher's except that the fabric was held vertically. An important improvement on his machine was to have the needle running away from the point, starting from the eye.[9] After a lengthy stay in England trying to attract interest in his machine, he returned to America to find various people infringing his patent, among them Isaac Merritt Singer.[10] He eventually won a case for patent infringement in 1854 and was awarded the right to claim royalties from the manufacturers using ideas covered by his patent, including Singer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSinger had seen a rotary sewing machine being repaired in a Boston shop. As an engineer, he thought it was clumsy and decided to design a better one. The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a presser foot to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic tension system. This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe's machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851, and it was suggested[by whom?] he patent the foot pedal or treadle, used to power some of his machines; unfortunately, the foot pedal had been in use too long for a patent to be issued. When Howe learned of Singer's machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a lump sum for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe's patent and paid him $1.15 per machine before entering into a joint partnership with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first hire-purchase arrangement to allow people to buy their machines through payments over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Allen B. Wilson developed a shuttle that reciprocated in a short arc, which was an improvement over Singer and Howe's. However, John Bradshaw had patented a similar device and threatened to sue, so Wilson decided to try a new method. He went into partnership with Nathaniel Wheeler to produce a machine with a rotary hook instead of a shuttle. This was far quieter and smoother than other methods, with the result that the Wheeler & Wilson Company produced more machines in the 1850s and 1860s than any other manufacturer. Wilson also invented the four-motion feed mechanism that is still seen on every sewing machine today. This had a forward, down, back and up motion, which drew the cloth through in an even and smooth motion. Charles Miller patented the first machine to stitch buttonholes.[11] Throughout the 1850s more and more companies were being formed, each trying to sue the others for patent infringement.  This triggered a patent thicket known as the Sewing Machine War.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1856, the Sewing Machine Combination was formed, consisting of Singer, Howe, Wheeler, Wilson, Grover and Baker. These four companies pooled their patents, with the result that all other manufacturers had to obtain a license and pay $15 per machine. This lasted until 1877 when the last patent expired. \\r\\n\\r\\nJames Edward Allen Gibbs (1829ÿ1902), a farmer from Raphine in Rockbridge County, Virginia patented the first chain stitch single-thread sewing machine on June 2, 1857. In partnership with James Willcox, Gibbs became a principal partner in Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine Company. Willcox & Gibbs commercial sewing machines are still used in the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Jones started making sewing machines in 1859 and in 1860 formed a partnership with Thomas Chadwick. As Chadwick & Jones, they manufactured sewing machines at Ashton-under-Lyne, England until 1863. Their machines used designs from Howe and Wilson produced under licence.[14] Thomas Chadwick later joined Bradbury & Co. William Jones opened a factory in Guide Bridge, Manchester in 1869.[15] In 1893 a Jones advertising sheet claimed that this factory was the \\"Largest Factory in England Exclusively Making First Class Sewing Machines\\".[16] The firm was renamed as the Jones Sewing Machine Co. Ltd and was later acquired by Brother Industries of Japan, in 1968.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nClothing manufacturers were the first sewing machine customers, and used them to produce the first ready-to-wear clothing and shoes. In the 1860s consumers began purchasing them, and the machinesranging in price from S6 to S15 in Britain depending on featuresbecame very common in middle-class homes. Owners were much more likely to spend free time with their machines to make and mend clothing for their families than to visit friends, and women's magazines and household guides such as Mrs Beeton's offered dress patterns and instructions. A sewing machine could produce a man's shirt in about one hour, compared to 14 1/2 hours by hand.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1877 the world's first crochet machine was invented and patented by Joseph M. Merrow, then-president of what had started in the 1840s as a machine shop to develop specialized machinery for the knitting operations. This crochet machine was the first production overlock sewing machine. The Merrow Machine Company went on to become one of the largest American Manufacturers of overlock sewing machines and continues to be a global presence in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1885 Singer patented the Singer Vibrating Shuttle sewing machine, which used Allen B. Wilson's idea for a vibrating shuttle and was a better lockstitcher than the oscillating shuttles of the time. Millions of the machines, perhaps the world's first really practical sewing machine for domestic use, were produced until finally superseded by rotary shuttle machines in the 20th century. Sewing machines continued being made to roughly the same design, with more lavish decoration appearing until well into the 1900s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first electric machines were developed by Singer Sewing Co. and introduced in 1889.[19] By the end of the First World War, Singer was offering hand, treadle and electric machines for sale. At first, the electric machines were standard machines with a motor strapped on the side, but as more homes gained power, they became more popular and the motor was gradually introduced into the casing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSewing machines can make a great variety of plain or patterned stitches. Ignoring strictly decorative aspects, over three dozen distinct stitch formations are formally recognized by the ISO 4915:1991 standard, involving one to seven separate threads to form the stitch.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlain stitches fall into four general categories: chainstitch, lockstitch, overlock, and coverstitch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChainstitch was used by early sewing machines and has two major drawbacks:\\r\\nA better stitch was found in the lockstitch. The chainstitch is still used today in clothing manufacture, though due to its major drawback it is generally paired with an overlock stitch along the same seam.\\r\\n\\r\\nLockstitch is the familiar stitch performed by most household sewing machines and most industrial \\"single needle\\" sewing machines from two threads, one passed through a needle and one coming from a bobbin or shuttle. Each thread stays on the same side of the material being sewn, interlacing with the other thread at each needle hole by means of a bobbin driver. As a result, a lockstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn; it does not need to be near an edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverlock, also known as \\"serging\\" or \\"serger stitch\\", can be formed with one to four threads, one or two needles, and one or two loopers. Overlock sewing machines are usually equipped with knives that trim or create the edge immediately in front of the stitch formation. Household and industrial overlock machines are commonly used for garment seams in knit or stretchy fabrics, for garment seams where the fabric is light enough that the seam does not need to be pressed open, and for protecting edges against raveling. Machines using two to four threads are most common, and frequently one machine can be configured for several varieties of overlock stitch. Overlock machines with five or more threads usually make both a chainstitch with one needle and one looper, and an overlock stitch with the remaining needles and loopers. This combination is known as a \\"safety stitch\\". A similar machine used for stretch fabrics is called a mock safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoverstitch is formed by two or more needles and one or two loopers. Like lockstitch and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a bottom cover stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper threads covers raw seam edges, much as the overlock stitch does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.\\r\\n\\r\\nA zigzag stitch is a variant geometry of the lockstitch. It is a back-and-forth stitch used where a straight stitch will not suffice, such as in preventing raveling of a fabric, in stitching stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen creating a zigzag stitch, the back-and-forth motion of the sewing machine's needle is controlled by a cam. As the cam rotates, a fingerlike follower, connected to the needle bar, rides along the cam and tracks its indentations. As the follower moves in and out, the needle bar is moved from side to side.[22] Very old sewing machines lack this hardware and so cannot natively produce a zigzag stitch, but there are often shank-driven attachments available which enable them to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the basic motion of needles, loopers and bobbins, the material being sewn must move so that each cycle of needle motion involves a different part of the material. This motion is known as feed, and sewing machines have almost as many ways of feeding material as they do of forming stitches. For general categories, there are: drop feed, needle feed, walking foot, puller, and manual. Often, multiple types of feed are used on the same machine. Besides these general categories, there are also uncommon feed mechanisms used in specific applications like edge joining fur, making seams on caps, and blindstitching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drop feed mechanism is used by almost all household machines and involves a mechanism below the sewing surface of the machine. When the needle is withdrawn from the material being sewn, a set of \\"feed dogs\\" is pushed up through slots in the machine surface, then dragged horizontally past the needle. The dogs are serrated to grip the material, and a \\"presser foot\\" is used to keep the material in contact with the dogs. At the end of their horizontal motion, the dogs are lowered again and returned to their original position while the needle makes its next pass through the material. While the needle is in the material, there is no feed action. Almost all household machines and the majority of industrial machines use drop feed. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferential feed is a variation of drop feed with two independent sets of dogs, one before and one after the needle. By changing their relative motions, these sets of dogs can be used to stretch or compress the material in the vicinity of the needle. This is extremely useful when sewing stretchy material, and overlock machines (heavily used for such materials) frequently have differential feed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA needle feed, used only in industrial machines, moves the material while the needle is in the material. In fact, the needle may be the primary feeding force. Some implementations of needle feed rock the axis of needle motion back and forth, while other implementations keep the axis vertical while moving it forward and back. In both cases, there is no feed action while the needle is out of the material. Needle feed is often used in conjunction with a modified drop feed, and is very common on industrial two needle machines. Household machines do not use needle feed as a general rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nA walking foot replaces the stationary presser foot with one that moves along with whatever other feed mechanisms the machine already has. As the walking foot moves, it shifts the workpiece along with it. It is most useful for sewing heavy materials where needle feed is mechanically inadequate, for spongy or cushioned materials where lifting the foot out of contact with the material helps in the feeding action, and for sewing many layers together where a drop feed will cause the lower layers to shift out of position with the upper layers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome factory machines and a few household machines are set up with an auxiliary puller feed, which grips the material being sewn (usually from behind the needles) and pulls it with a force and reliability usually not possible with other types of feed. Puller feeds are seldom built directly into the basic sewing machine. Their action must be synchronized with the needle and feed action built into the machine to avoid damaging the machine. Pullers are also limited to straight seams, or very nearly so. Despite their additional cost and limitations, pulling feeds are very useful when making large heavy items like tents and vehicle covers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA manual feed is used primarily in freehand embroidery, quilting, and shoe repair. With manual feed, the stitch length and direction is controlled entirely by the motion of the material being sewn. Frequently some form of hoop or stabilizing material is used with fabric to keep the material under proper tension and aid in moving it around. Most household machines can be set for manual feed by disengaging the drop feed dogs. Most industrial machines can not be used for manual feed without actually removing the feed dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSewing machines use special needles tailored to their needs and to the character of the material being sewn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial sewing machines are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task. Industrial machines, unlike domestic machines, perform a single dedicated task and are capable of long hours of usage and as such have larger moving parts and comparatively much larger motors. Industrial machines are also more generic; a motor for almost any type of machine can work on any brand. Sewing feet and bobbins between brands are interchangeable. However, with domestic machines the motor, and to a lesser extent bobbins and sewing feet, are brand specific.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motors on industrial machines, as with most of their components, lights, etc., are separate, usually mounted to the underside of the table. Domestic machines have their OEM motors mounted inside the machine. There are two different types of motor available for industrial machines: a servo motor (which uses less electricity and is silent when not in use), and the more traditional clutch motor (which is always spinning; even when not in use).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore sewing machines were invented women spent much of their time maintaining their family's clothing. Middle-class housewives, even with the aid of a hired seamstress, would devote several days of each month to this task. It took an experienced seamstress at least 14 hours to make a dress shirt for a man; a woman's dress took 10 hours;[24] and a pair of summer pants took nearly three hours.[25] Most individuals would have only two sets of clothing: a work outfit and a Sunday outfit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSewing machines reduced the time for making a dress shirt to an hour and 15 minutes; the time to make a dress to an hour;[24] and the time for a pair of summer pants to 38 minutes.[25] This reduced labor resulted in women having a diminished role in household management, and allowed more hours for their own leisure as well as the ability to seek more employment.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial use of sewing machines further reduced the burden placed upon housewives, moving clothing production from housewives and seamstresses to large-scale factories.[24] The movement to large-scale factories also resulted in a decrease in the amount of time clothing production took, which caused the prices for clothing to drop significantly. This is because manufacturers were able to decrease the number of workers needed to produce the same amount of clothing, resulting in reduced costs. Increased supply also lowered the cost.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial effects of sewing machines on workers were both positive and negative, however in the long run the negative effects decreased. Many of the women who had previously been busy at home could now seek employment in factories, increasing the income for their family. This allowed for families to be able to afford more sets of clothing and items than they previously could.[25] For seamstresses, home sewing machines allowed them to produce clothing for the average person during periods when demand for fitted clothes was low, effectively increasing their earnings. When industrial sewing machines initially became popular many seamstresses working in factories, as well as those working at home, lost their jobs as it meant that fewer workers could produce the same output.[24] In the long run these now unemployed workers along with thousands of men and children would eventually be able to gain employment in jobs created as the clothing industry grew.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sewing machine's effects on the clothing industry resulted in major changes for other industries as well. Cotton production needed to increase in order to match the demand of the new clothing factories. As a result, cotton became planted in new areas where it hadn't previously been farmed. Other industries involved in the process benefited as well such as metal companies who provided for parts of the machines and shippers to move the increased amounts of goods.[26] In addition to being important for clothing production, sewing machines also became important in the manufacturing of furniture with upholstery, curtains and towels, toys, books, and many other products.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew home 1917 sewing machine in cabinet","input":"When were sewing machines first used in the home?"},{"output":"symbolise fire (the sun, representing courage), earth (representing dedication) and water (representing purity and equality)","context":"The flag of Trinidad and Tobago was adopted upon independence from the United Kingdom on 31 August 1962.

Ұץ; post-reform Russian: 񳭷?  Ұ, translit.?Voyn i mir [v?j?na i ?m?ir]) is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, which is regarded as a central work of world literature and one of Tolstoy's finest literary achievements.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805,[4] were serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869.[5]\\r\\nTolstoy said War and Peace is \\"not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle\\". Large sections, especially the later chapters, are a philosophical discussion rather than narrative.[6] Tolstoy also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel. The Encyclop?dia Britannica states: \\"It can be argued that no single English novel attains the universality of the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWar and Peace is perhaps best known as one of the longest novels ever written.[citation needed]\\r\\nTolstoy began writing War and Peace in the year [when?] that he finally married and settled down at his country estate. The first half of the book was written under the name \\"1805\\". During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged Schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations. However, Tolstoy developed his own views of history and the role of the individual within it.[8]\\r\\nThe first draft of the novel was completed in 1863. In 1865, the periodical Russkiy Vestnik (The Russian Messenger) published the first part of this draft under the title 1805 and published more the following year. Tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version, although he allowed several parts of it to be published with a different ending in 1867. He heavily rewrote the entire novel between 1866 and 1869.[5][8] Tolstoy's wife, Sophia Tolstaya, copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before Tolstoy considered it again ready for publication.[8] The version that was published in Russkiy Vestnik had a very different ending from the version eventually published under the title War and Peace in 1869. Russians who had read the serialized version were anxious to buy the complete novel, and it sold out almost immediately. The novel was translated almost immediately after publication into many other languages.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is unknown why Tolstoy changed the name to War and Peace. He may have borrowed the title from the 1861 work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: La Guerre et la Paix (\\"The War and the Peace\\" in French).[4] The title may also be another reference to Titus, described as being a master of \\"war and peace\\" in The Twelve Caesars, written by Suetonius in 119 CE. The completed novel was then called Voyna i mir (񳭷  Ұ in new-style orthography; in English War and Peace).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1805 manuscript was re-edited and annotated in Russia in 1983 and since has been translated into English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Albanian, Korean, and Czech. The existence of so many versions make this work one of the best insights into the mental processes of a great novelist.[citation needed]\\r\\nTolstoy was instrumental in bringing a new kind of consciousness to the novel. His narrative structure is noted for its \\"god-like\\" ability to hover over and within events, but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed a particular character's point of view. His use of visual detail is often cinematic in scope, using the literary equivalents of panning, wide shots and close-ups. These devices, while not exclusive to Tolstoy, are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid-19th century and of which Tolstoy proved himself a master.[9]\\r\\nThe standard Russian text of War and Peace is divided into four books (comprising fifteen parts) and an epilogue in two parts. Roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters, whereas the latter parts, as well as the second part of the epilogue, increasingly consist of essays about the nature of war, power, history, and historiography. Tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in a way that defies previous fictional convention. Certain abridged versions remove these essays entirely, while others, published even during Tolstoy's life, simply moved these essays into an appendix.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe novel is set 60 years before Tolstoy's day, but he had spoken with people who lived through the 1812 French invasion of Russia. He read all the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars and had read letters, journals, autobiographies and biographies of Napoleon and other key players of that era. There are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in War and Peace.[10]\\r\\nHe worked from primary source materials (interviews and other documents), as well as from history books, philosophy texts and other historical novels.[8] Tolstoy also used a great deal of his own experience in the Crimean War to bring vivid detail and first-hand accounts of how the Russian army was structured.[11]\\r\\nTolstoy was critical of standard history, especially military history, in War and Peace. He explains at the start of the novel's third volume his own views on how history ought to be written. His aim was to blur the line between fiction and history, to get closer to the truth, as he states in Volume II.\\r\\nAlthough the book is mainly in Russian, significant portions of dialogue are in French. It has been suggested[12] that the use of French is a deliberate literary device, to portray artifice while Russian emerges as a language of sincerity, honesty, and seriousness. It could, however, also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book is written, since French was the common language of the Russian aristocracy at the time.[13] In fact, the Russian nobility often knew only enough Russian to command their servants; Tolstoy illustrates this by showing that Julie Karagina, a character in the novel, is so unfamiliar with her native tongue that she has to take Russian lessons.\\r\\nThe use of French diminishes as the book progresses. It is suggested that this is to demonstrate Russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination,[12] and to show that a once-friendly nation has turned into an enemy. By midway through the book, several of the Russian aristocracy are anxious to find Russian tutors for themselves.\\r\\nThe novel spans the period 1805 to 1820. The era of Catherine the Great was still fresh in the minds of older people. Catherine had made French the language of her royal court.[14] For the next one hundred years, it became a social requirement for members of the Russian nobility to speak French and understand French culture.[14] This historical and cultural context in the aristocracy is reflected in War and Peace. Catherine's grandson, Alexander I, came to the throne in 1801 at the age of 24. In the novel, his mother, Marya Feodorovna, is the most powerful woman in the Russian court.\\r\\nThe novel tells the story of five familiesthe Bezukhovs, the Bolkonskys, the Rostovs, the Kuragins, and the Drubetskoys.\\r\\nThe main characters are:\\r\\nIn addition several real-life historical characters (such as Napoleon) and Prince Mikhail Kutuzov play a prominent part in the book. Many of Tolstoy's characters were based on real people. His grandparents and their friends were the models for many of the main characters; his great-grandparents would have been of the generation of Prince Vassily or Count Ilya Rostov.\\r\\nThe novel begins in July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soire given by Anna Pavlovna Schererthe maid of honour and confidante to the dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters are introduced as they enter the salon. Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a wealthy count, who is dying after a series of strokes. Pierre is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance. Educated abroad at his father's expense following his mother's death, Pierre is kindhearted but socially awkward, and finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at the soire that Pierre is his father's favorite of all the old counts illegitimate progeny.\\r\\nAlso attending the soire is Pierre's friend, Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, a charming society favourite. He is disillusioned with Petersburg society and with married life, feeling that his wife is empty and superficial, and decides to escape to become aide-de-camp to Prince Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov in the coming war against Napoleon.\\r\\nThe plot moves to Moscow, Russia's former capital, contrasting its provincial, more Russian ways to the more European society of Petersburg. The Rostov family are introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov and Countess Natalya Rostova are an affectionate couple but forever worried about their disordered finances. They have four children. Thirteen-year-old Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris Drubetskoy, a young man who is about to join the army as an officer. Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia Alexandrovna), his fifteen-year-old cousin, an orphan who has been brought up by the Rostovs. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage in a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) at nine is the youngest; like his brother, he is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age.\\r\\nAt Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys' country estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich and devoutly religious sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya, who refuses to marry the son of a wealthy aristocrat on account of her devotion to her father.\\r\\nThe second part opens with descriptions of the impending Russian-French war preparations. At the Sch?ngrabern engagement, Nikolai Rostov, now an ensign in the Hussars, has his first taste of battle. Boris Drubetskoy introduces him to Prince Andrei, whom Rostov insults in a fit of impetuousness. He is deeply attracted by Tsar Alexander's charisma. Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich Denisov, and befriends the ruthless, and perhaps, psychopathic Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov. Bolkonsky, Rostov and Denisov are involved in the disastrous Battle of Austerlitz, in which Prince Andrei is badly wounded as he attempts to rescue a Russian standard.\\r\\nThe Battle of Austerlitz is a major event in the book. As the battle is about to start, Prince Andrei thinks the approaching \\"day [will] be his Toulon, or his Arcola\\",[15] references to Napoleon's early victories. Later in the battle, however, Andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero, Napoleon. But his previous enthusiasm has been shattered; he no longer thinks much of Napoleon, \\"so petty did his hero with his paltry vanity and delight in victory appear, compared to that lofty, righteous and kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended\\".[16] Tolstoy portrays Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a victory at Borodino during the 1812 invasion.\\r\\nBook Two begins with Nikolai Rostov briefly returning on leave to Moscow accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from his Pavlograd Regiment. He spends an eventful winter at home. Natasha has blossomed into a beautiful young girl. Denisov falls in love with her, proposes marriage but is rejected. Although his mother pleads with Nikolai to marry a wealthy heiress to rescue the family from its dire financial straits, Nikolai refuses. Instead he promises to marry his childhood sweetheart and orphaned cousin, the dowry-less Sonya.\\r\\nPierre Bezukhov, upon finally receiving his massive inheritance, is suddenly transformed from a bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in the Russian Empire. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage with Prince Kuragin's beautiful and immoral daughter Hlne (Elena Vasilyevna Kuragina). Hlne, who is rumoured to be involved in an incestuous affair with her brother Anatol, tells Pierre that she will never have children with him. Hlne is also rumoured to have an affair with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and challenges Dolokhov to a duel. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. Hlne denies her affair, but Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his moral and spiritual confusion, Pierre joins the Freemasons. Much of Book Two concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He attempts to liberate his serfs, but ultimately achieves nothing of note.\\r\\nPierre is contrasted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Andrei recovers from his near-fatal wound in a military hospital and returns home, only to find his wife Lise dying in childbirth. He is stricken by his guilty conscience for not treating her better. His child, Nikolai, survives.\\r\\nBurdened with nihilistic disillusionment, Prince Andrei does not return to the army but remains on his estate, working on a project that would codify military behavior to solve problems of disorganization responsible for the loss of life on the Russian side. Pierre visits him and brings new questions: where is God in this amoral world? Pierre is interested in panentheism and the possibility of an afterlife.\\r\\nPierre's wife, Hlne, begs him to take her back, and trying to abide by the Freemason laws of forgiveness, he agrees. Hlne establishes herself as an influential hostess in Petersburg society.\\r\\nPrince Andrei feels impelled to take his newly written military notions to Petersburg, naively expecting to influence either the Emperor himself or those close to him. Young Natasha, also in Petersburg, is caught up in the excitement of her first grand ball, where she meets Prince Andrei and briefly reinvigorates him with her vivacious charm. Andrei believes he has found purpose in life again and, after paying the Rostovs several visits, proposes marriage to Natasha. However, Andrei's father dislikes the Rostovs and opposes the marriage, and he insists the couple wait a year before marrying. Prince Andrei leaves to recuperate from his wounds abroad, leaving Natasha initially distraught. Count Rostov takes her and Sonya to Moscow in order to raise funds for her trousseau.\\r\\nNatasha visits the Moscow opera, where she meets Hlne and her brother Anatole. Anatole has since married a Polish woman whom he has abandoned in Poland. He is very attracted to Natasha and determined to seduce her, and conspires with his sister to do so. Anatole succeeds in making Natasha believe he loves her, eventually establishing plans to elope. Natasha writes to Princess Maria, Andrei's sister, breaking off her engagement. At the last moment, Sonya discovers her plans to elope and foils them. Natasha learns from Pierre of Anatole's marriage. Devastated, Natasha makes a suicide attempt and is left seriously ill.\\r\\nPierre is initially horrified by Natasha's behavior, but realizes he has fallen in love with her. As the Great Comet of 1811ÿ12 streaks the sky, life appears to begin anew for Pierre. Prince Andrei coldly accepts Natasha's breaking of the engagement. He tells Pierre that his pride will not allow him to renew his proposal.\\r\\nWith the help of her family, and the stirrings of religious faith, Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through this dark period. Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation between Napoleon's troops and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself through gematria that Napoleon is the Antichrist of the Book of Revelation. Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French marauders are coming for his estate. No organized help from any Russian army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria.\\r\\nBack in Moscow, the patriotic Petya joins a crowd in audience of Czar Alexander and manages to snatch a biscuit thrown from the balcony window of the Cathedral of the Assumption by the Czar. He is nearly crushed by the throngs in his effort. Under the influence of the same patriotism, his father finally allows him to enlist.\\r\\nNapoleon himself is a main character in this section, and the novel presents him in vivid detail, both personally and as both a thinker and would-be strategist. Also described are the well-organized force of over 400,000 French Army (only 140,000 of them actually French-speaking) that marches through the Russian countryside in the late summer and reaches the outskirts of the city of Smolensk. Pierre decides to leave Moscow and go to watch the Battle of Borodino from a vantage point next to a Russian artillery crew. After watching for a time, he begins to join in carrying ammunition. In the midst of the turmoil he experiences first-hand the death and destruction of war; Eugne's artillery continues to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. The battle becomes a hideous slaughter for both armies and ends in a standoff. The Russians, however, have won a moral victory by standing up to Napoleon's reputedly invincible army. The Russian army withdraws the next day, allowing Napoleon to march on to Moscow. Among the casualties are Anatole Kuragin and Prince Andrei. Anatole loses a leg, and Andrei suffers a grenade wound in the abdomen. Both are reported dead, but their families are in such disarray that no one can be notified.\\r\\nThe Rostovs have waited until the last minute to abandon Moscow, even after it is clear that Kutuzov has retreated past Moscow and Muscovites are being given contradictory instructions on how to either flee or fight. Count Rostopchin, the commander in chief of Moscow, is publishing posters, rousing the citizens to put their faith in religious icons, while at the same time urging them to fight with pitchforks if necessary. Before fleeing himself, he gives orders to burn the city. The Rostovs have a difficult time deciding what to take with them, but in the end, Natasha convinces them to load their carts with the wounded and dying from the Battle of Borodino. Unknown to Natasha, Prince Andrei is amongst the wounded.\\r\\nWhen Napoleon's Grand Army finally occupies an abandoned and burning Moscow, Pierre takes off on a quixotic mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos, shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha and some of her family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and smiles at him, and he in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her.\\r\\nPierre saves the life of a French officer who fought at Borodino, yet is taken prisoner by the retreating French during his attempted assassination of Napoleon, after saving a woman from being raped by soldiers in the French Army.\\r\\nPierre becomes friends with a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who is utterly without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning in life simply by interacting with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the harsh Russian winter. After months of trial and tribulationduring which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the FrenchPierre is finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov, after a small skirmish with the French that sees the young Petya Rostov killed in action.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Andrei has been taken in and cared for by the Rostovs, fleeing from Moscow to Yaroslavl. He is reunited with Natasha and his sister Maria before the end of the war. Having lost all will to live, he forgives Natasha in a last act before dying.\\r\\nAs the novel draws to a close, Pierre's wife Hlne dies from an overdose of an abortifacient (Tolstoy does not state it explicitly but the euphemism he uses is unambiguous). Pierre is reunited with Natasha, while the victorious Russians rebuild Moscow. Natasha speaks of Prince Andrei's death and Pierre of Karataev's. Both are aware of a growing bond between them in their bereavement. With the help of Princess Maria, Pierre finds love at last and marries Natasha.\\r\\nThe first part of the epilogue begins with the wedding of Pierre and Natasha in 1813. Count Rostov dies soon after, leaving his eldest son Nikolai to take charge of the debt-ridden estate. Nikolai finds himself with the task of maintaining the family on the verge of bankruptcy. His abhorrence at the idea of marrying for wealth almost gets in his way, but finally he marries the now-rich Maria Bolkonskaya and in so doing saves his family from financial ruin (though manages to do so without selling any of his wife's property).\\r\\nNikolai and Maria then move to Bald Hills with his mother and Sonya, whom he supports for the rest of their lives. They also raise Prince Andrei's orphaned son, Nikolai Andreyevich (Nikolenka) Bolkonsky.\\r\\nAs in all good marriages, there are misunderstandings, but the couplesPierre and Natasha, Nikolai and Mariaremain devoted to their spouses. Pierre and Natasha visit Bald Hills in 1820. There is a hint in the closing chapters that the idealistic, boyish Nikolenka and Pierre would both become part of the Decembrist Uprising. The first epilogue concludes with Nikolenka promising he would do something with which even his late father \\"would be satisfied\\" (presumably as a revolutionary in the Decembrist revolt).\\r\\nThe second part of the epilogue contains Tolstoy's critique of all existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-century Great Man Theory claims that historical events are the result of the actions of \\"heroes\\" and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved (he compares this to calculus, and the sum of infinitesimals). He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free-will, necessity being based on reason and therefore explainable by historical analysis, and free-will being based on \\"consciousness\\" and therefore inherently unpredictable.\\r\\nThe novel that made its author \\"the true lion of the Russian literature\\" (according to Ivan Goncharov)[17][18] enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later Tolstoy scholars.[18] Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper Golos (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: \\"What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?.. Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?\\"[18]\\r\\nWriter and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing in Vsemirny Trud (#6, 1867) suggested that War and Peace was \\"neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel\\", but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it. \\"The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century\\", was his suggestion. \\"It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation's life\\", wrote Ivan Turgenev in his bid to define War and Peace in the foreword for his French translation of \\"The Two Hussars\\" (published in Paris by Le Temps in 1875).\\r\\nIn general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the \\"author's inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel\\", as critic Varfolomey Zaytsev put it.[19] Articles by D. Minayev, V. Bervi-Flerovsky and N. Shelgunov in Delo magazine characterized the novel as \\"lacking realism\\", showing its characters as \\"cruel and rough\\", \\"mentally stoned\\", \\"morally depraved\\" and promoting \\"the philosophy of stagnation\\". Still, Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin, who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with \\"how strongly this Count has stung our higher society\\".[20] Dmitry Pisarev in his unfinished article \\"Russian Gentry of Old\\" (Staroye barstvo, Otechestvennye Zapiski, #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy's realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, 'idealized' the old nobility, expressing \\"unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards\\" the Russian dvoryanstvo. On the opposite front, the conservative press and \\"patriotic\\" authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the \\"patriotic feelings of our fathers\\" and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.[18]\\r\\nOne of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue of Vestnik Evropy. The critic praised Tolstoy's masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. \\"The dazzling side of the novel\\", according to Annenkov, was \\"the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them.\\" Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two \\"great raznotchintsys\\", Speransky and Arakcheev, and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel \\"this relatively rough but original element\\". In the end the critic called the novel \\"the whole epoch in the Russian fiction\\".[18]\\r\\nSlavophiles declared Tolstoy their \\"bogatyr\\" and pronounced War and Peace \\"the Bible of the new national idea\\". Several articles on War and Peace were published in 1869ÿ70 in Zarya magazine by Nikolai Strakhov. \\"War and Peace is the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before\\", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. \\"It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the War and Peace was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning\\", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of \\"meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind\\" (using Apollon Grigoriev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book The World as a Whole, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of \\"Russian meekness vs. Western bestiality\\") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.[21]\\r\\nAmong the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in the war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of the Russky Invalid newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the Battle of Sch?ngrabern scenes \\"bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness\\" and totally agreed with the author's view on the Battle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer Mikhail Dragomirov, in an article published in Oruzheiny Sbornik (The Military Almanac, 1868ÿ70), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the \\"spontaneity\\" of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use War and Peace as their desk book, describing its battle scenes as \\"incomparable\\" and \\"serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art.\\"[18]\\r\\nUnlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoyevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring War and Peace the masterpiece of the Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878 letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish War and Peace, adding: \\"This is positively what might be called a Russian Iliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever.[22] In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen Anna Karenina to start with, Goncharov insisted: \\"War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel's] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life.\\"[23] In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works have now been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of War and Peace. \\"Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]\\", he remarked.[24]\\r\\nFyodor Dostoyevsky (in a May 30, 1871 letter to Strakhov) described War and Peace as \\"the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that\\". In a draft version of The Raw Youth he described Tolstoy as \\"a historiograph of the dvoryanstvo, or rather, its cultural elite\\". \\"The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools\\", he added.[25] In 1876 Dostoyevsky wrote: \\"My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledgenot only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy.\\"[26]\\r\\nNikolai Leskov, then an anonymous reviewer in Birzhevy Vestnik (The Stock Exchange Herald), wrote several articles praising highly War and Peace, calling it \\"the best ever Russian historical novel\\" and \\"the pride of the contemporary literature\\". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for \\"having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved\\". \\"While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers\\", Leskov wrote.[18]\\r\\nAfanasy Fet, in a January 1, 1870 letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. \\"You've managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it\\", he added.[27]\\r\\nIvan Turgenev gradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novels historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper Le XIXe Sicle, Turgenev described Tolstoy as \\"the most popular Russian writer\\" and War and Peace as \\"one of the most remarkable books of our age\\".[28] \\"This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it theres true, real Russia\\", Turgenev wrote.[29] It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the War and Peace (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.[18]\\r\\nSince then many world famous authors have praised War and Peace as a masterpiece of the world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: \\"This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed.\\"[30] Later John Galsworthy called War and Peace \\"the best novel that had ever been written\\". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: \\"this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement.\\"[31] Thomas Mann thought War and Peace to be \\"the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature.\\"[32] Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he'd been taking lessons on how to \\"write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way.\\" \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did\\", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time anthology.[18]\\r\\nIsaak Babel said, after reading War and Peace, \\"If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.\\"[33] Tolstoy \\"gives us a unique combination of the 'naive objectivity' of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation.\\"[34]\\r\\nWar and Peace has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English on several occasions, starting with Clara Bell working from a French translation. The translators Constance Garnett and Louise and Aylmer Maude knew Tolstoy personally. Translations have to deal with Tolstoys often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions. About 2 per cent of War and Peace is in French; Tolstoy removed the French in a revised 1873 edition, only to restore it later.[12] Most translators follow Garnett retaining some French, Briggs uses no French, while Pevear-Volokhonsky and Amy Mandelker's revision of the Maude translation both retain the French fully.[12] (For a list of translations see below.)\\r\\nIn the Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English, academic Zoja Pavlovskis-Petit has this to say about the translations of War and Peace available in 2000: \\"Of all the translations of War and Peace, Dunnigan's (1968) is the best. ... Unlike the other translators, Dunnigan even succeeds with many characteristically Russian folk expressions and proverbs. ... She is faithful to the text and does not hesitate to render conscientiously those details that the uninitiated may find bewildering: for instance, the statement that Boris's mother pronounced his name with a stress on the o ÿ an indication to the Russian reader of the old lady's affectation.\\"\\r\\nOn the Garnett translation Pavlovskis-Petit writes: \\"her ...War and Peace is frequently inexact and contains too many anglicisms. Her style is awkward and turgid, very unsuitable for Tolstoi.\\" On the Maudes' translation she comments: \\"this should have been the best translation, but the Maudes' lack of adroitness in dealing with Russian folk idiom, and their style in general, place this version below Dunnigan's.\\" She further comments on Edmonds's revised translation, formerly on Penguin: \\"[it] is the work of a sound scholar but not the best possible translator; it frequently lacks resourcefulness and imagination in its use of English. ... a respectable translation but not on the level of Dunnigan or Maude.\\"[35]","input":"How many war and peace books are there?"},{"output":"drought","context":"The Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) or Harappan Civilisation was a Bronze Age civilisation (3300ÿ1300 BCE; mature period 2600ÿ1900 BCE) mainly in the northwestern regions of South Asia, extending from what today is northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India.[1] Along with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia it was one of three early civilisations of the Old World, and of the three, the most widespread[2][note 1]\\r\\nIt flourished in the basins of the Indus River, which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial, mostly monsoon-fed, rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the seasonal Ghaggar-Hakra river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.[3][4][5][note 2] Aridification of this region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial spur for the urbanisation associated with the civilisation, but eventually also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward.[6][7][5][8][note 3]\\r\\nAt its peak, the Indus Civilisation may have had a population of over five million.[9] Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley developed new techniques in handicraft (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). The Indus cities are noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, and clusters of large non-residential buildings.[10]\\r\\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation is also named the Harappan civilisation after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s in what was then the Punjab province of British India and now Pakistan.[11] The discovery of Harappa, and soon afterwards, Mohenjo-daro, was the culmination of work beginning in 1861 with the founding of the Archaeological Survey of India in the British Raj.[12] Excavation of Harappan sites has been ongoing since 1920, with important breakthroughs occurring as recently as 1999.[13] This Harappan civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from the cultures immediately preceding and following it. Of these, the earlier is often called the Early Harappan culture, while the later one may be referred to as the Late Harappan, both of which existed in the same area as the Mature Harappan Civilisation. The early Harappan cultures were preceded by local Neolithic agricultural villages, from where the river plains were populated.[14][15] As of 1999, over 1,056 cities and settlements had been found, of which 96 have been excavated,[16] mainly in the general region of the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra Rivers and their tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa, Mohenjo-daro (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Dholavira, Ganeriwala and Rakhigarhi.[17]\\r\\nThe Harappan language is not directly attested and its affiliation is uncertain since the Indus script is still undeciphered. A relationship with the Dravidian or Elamo-Dravidian language family is favoured by a section of scholars.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) encompassed much of Pakistan, western India, and northeastern Afghanistan; extending from Pakistani Balochistan in the west to Uttar Pradesh in the east, northeastern Afghanistan to the north and Maharashtra to the south.[20] The geography of the Indus Valley put the civilisations that arose there in a highly similar situation to those in Egypt and Peru, with rich agricultural lands being surrounded by highlands, desert, and ocean. Recently, Indus sites have been discovered in Pakistan's northwestern Frontier Province as well. Other IVC colonies can be found in Afghanistan while smaller isolated colonies can be found as far away as Turkmenistan and in Maharashtra. The largest number of colonies are in the Punjab, Sindh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujrat belt Coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor[21] in Western Baluchistan to Lothal[22] in Gujarat. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan,[23] in the Gomal River valley in northwestern Pakistan,[24] at Manda, Jammu on the Beas River near Jammu,[25] India, and at Alamgirpur on the Hindon River, only 28?km from Delhi.[26] Indus Valley sites have been found most often on rivers, but also on the ancient seacoast,[27] for example, Balakot,[28] and on islands, for example, Dholavira.[29]\\r\\nIt flourished in the basins of the Indus River, which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial, mostly monsoon-fed, rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the seasonal Ghaggar-Hakra river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.[3][4][5][note 2] There is evidence of dry river beds overlapping with the Hakra channel in Pakistan and the seasonal Ghaggar River in India. Many Indus Valley sites have been discovered along the Ghaggar-Hakra beds.[30] Among them are: Rupar, Rakhigarhi, Sothi, Kalibangan, and Ganwariwala.[31]\\r\\nAccording to some archaeologists, more than 500 Harappan sites have been discovered along the dried up river beds of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries,[32] in contrast to only about 100 along the Indus and its tributaries;[33] consequently, in their opinion, the appellation Indus Ghaggar-Hakra civilisation is justified. However, these arguments are disputed by other archaeologists who state that the Ghaggar-Hakra desert area has been left untouched by settlements and agriculture since the end of the Indus period and hence shows more sites than those found in the alluvium of the Indus Valley; second, that the number of Harappan sites along the Ghaggar-Hakra river beds has been exaggerated.[34] \\"Harappan Civilisation\\" remains the commonly used name, according to the archaeological norm of naming a civilisation after its first findspot.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe ruins of Harappa were described in 1842 by Charles Masson in his Narrative of Various Journeys in Balochistan, Afghanistan, and the Punjab, where locals talked of an ancient city extending \\"thirteen cosses\\" (about 25 miles or 41 km).[note 4]\\r\\nIn 1856, Alexander Cunningham, later director-general of the archaeological survey of northern India, visited Harappa where the British engineers John and William Brunton were laying the East Indian Railway Company line connecting the cities of Karachi and Lahore. John wrote, \\"I was much exercised in my mind how we were to get ballast for the line of the railway\\". They were told of an ancient ruined city near the lines, called Harappa. Visiting the city, he found it full of hard well-burnt bricks, and, \\"convinced that there was a grand quarry for the ballast I wanted\\", the city of Harappa was reduced to ballast.[36] A few months later, further north, John's brother William Brunton's \\"section of the line ran near another ruined city, bricks from which had already been used by villagers in the nearby village of Harappa at the same site. These bricks now provided ballast along 93 miles (150?km) of the railroad track running from Karachi to Lahore\\".[36]\\r\\nIn 1872ÿ75, Cunningham published the first Harappan seal (with an erroneous identification as Brahmi letters).[37] More Harappan seals were discovered in 1912 by John Faithfull Fleet, prompting an archaeological campaign under Sir John Hubert Marshall. Marshall, Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni and Madho Sarup Vats began excavating Harappa in 1921, finding buildings and artefacts indicative of an ancient civilisation. These were soon complemented by discoveries at Mohenjo-daro by Rakhal Das Banerjee, Ernest J. H. Mackay, and Marshall. By 1931, much of Mohenjo-daro had been excavated, but excavations continued, such as that led by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, director of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1944. Among other archaeologists who worked on IVC sites before the independence in 1947 were Ahmad Hasan Dani, Brij Basi Lal, Nani Gopal Majumdar, and Sir Marc Aurel Stein.[citation needed]\\r\\nFollowing independence, the bulk of the archaeological finds were inherited by Pakistan where most of the IVC was based, and excavations from this time include those led by Wheeler in 1949, archaeological adviser to the Government of Pakistan. Outposts of the Indus Valley civilisation were excavated as far west as Sutkagan Dor in Pakistani Balochistan, as far north as at Shortugai on the Amu Darya (the river's ancient name was Oxus) in current Afghanistan, as far east as at Alamgirpur, Uttar Pradesh, India and as far south as at Malwan, in modern-day Surat, Gujarat, India.[38]\\r\\nIn 2010, heavy floods hit Haryana in India and damaged the archaeological site of Jognakhera, where ancient copper smelting furnaces were found dating back almost 5,000 years. The Indus Valley Civilisation site was hit by almost 10 feet of water as the Sutlej Yamuna link canal overflowed.[39]\\r\\nThe cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation had \\"social hierarchies, their writing system, their large planned cities and their long-distance trade [which] mark them to archaeologists as a full-fledged 'civilisation.'\\"[40] The mature phase of the Harappan civilisation lasted from c. 2600 to 1900 BCE. With the inclusion of the predecessor and successor cultures  Early Harappan and Late Harappan, respectively  the entire Indus Valley Civilisation may be taken to have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th centuries BCE. It is part of the Indus Valley Tradition, which also includes the pre-Harappan occupation of Mehrgarh, the earliest farming site of the Indus Valley.[15][41]\\r\\nSeveral periodisations are employed for the periodisation of the IVC.[15][41] The most commonly used classifies the Indus Valley Civilisation into Early, Mature and Late Harappan Phase.[42] An alternative approach by Shaffer divides the broader Indus Valley Tradition into four eras, the pre-Harappan \\"Early Food Producing Era,\\" and the Regionalisation, Integration, and Localisation eras, which correspond roughly with the Early Harappan, Mature Harappan, and Late Harappan phases.[14][43]\\r\\nAccording to Rao, Hakra Ware has been found at Bhirrana, and is pre-Harappan, dating to the 8th-7th millennium BCE.[44][45][46] Hakra Ware culture is a material culture which is contemporaneous with the early Harappan Ravi phase culture (3300-2800 BCE) of the Indus Valley.[47][48] According to Dikshit and Rami, the estimation for the antiquity of Bhirrana as pre-Harappan is based on two calculations of charcoal samples, giving two dates of respectively 7570-7180 BCE, and 6689-6201 BCE.[44][45]\\r\\nMehrgarh is a Neolithic (7000?BCE to c. 2500?BCE) site to the west of the Indus River valley, near the capital of the Kachi District in Pakistan, on the Kacchi Plain of Balochistan, near the Bolan Pass.[58] According to Ahmad Hasan Dani, professor emeritus at Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, the discovery of Mehrgarh \\"changed the entire concept of the Indus civilisation [] There we have the whole sequence, right from the beginning of settled village life.\\"[40] Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia.[59][60][note 6] According to Parpola, the culture migrated into the Indus Valley and became the Indus Valley Civilisation.[70]\\r\\nMehrgarh was influenced by the Near Eastern Neolithic,[71] with similarities between \\"domesticated wheat varieties, early phases of farming, pottery, other archaeological artefacts, some domesticated plants and herd animals.\\"[72] Gallego Romero et al. (2011) notice that \\"[t]he earliest evidence of cattle herding in south Asia comes from the Indus River Valley site of Mehrgarh and is dated to 7,000 YBP.\\"[73][note 7]\\r\\nLukacs and Hemphill suggest an initial local development of Mehrgarh, with a continuity in cultural development but a change in population. According to Lukacs and Hemphill, while there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic (Copper Age) cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic population of Mehrgarh,[75] which \\"suggests moderate levels of gene flow.\\"[75][note 8] Masacernhas et al. (2015) note that \\"new, possibly West Asian, body types are reported from the graves of Mehrgarh beginning in the Togau phase (3800 BCE).\\"[76]\\r\\nThe Early Harappan Ravi Phase, named after the nearby Ravi River, lasted from c.?3300 BCE until 2800 BCE. It is related to the Hakra Phase, identified in the Ghaggar-Hakra River Valley to the west, and predates the Kot Diji Phase (2800ÿ2600 BCE, Harappan 2), named after a site in northern Sindh, Pakistan, near Mohenjo-daro. The earliest examples of the Indus script date to the 3rd millennium BCE.[77][78]\\r\\nThe mature phase of earlier village cultures is represented by Rehman Dheri and Amri in Pakistan.[79] Kot Diji represents the phase leading up to Mature Harappan, with the citadel representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life. Another town of this stage was found at Kalibangan in India on the Hakra River.[80]\\r\\nTrade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials, including lapis lazuli and other materials for bead-making. By this time, villagers had domesticated numerous crops, including peas, sesame seeds, dates, and cotton, as well as animals, including the water buffalo. Early Harappan communities turned to large urban centres by 2600 BCE, from where the mature Harappan phase started. The latest research shows that Indus Valley people migrated from villages to cities.[81][82]\\r\\nAccording to Giosan et al. (2012), the slow southward migration of the monsoons across Asia initially allowed the Indus Valley villages to develop by taming the floods of the Indus and its tributaries. Flood-supported farming led to large agricultural surpluses, which in turn supported the development of cities. The IVC residents did not develop irrigation capabilities, relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods.[5] Brooke further notes that the development of advanced cities coincides with a reduction in rainfall, which may have triggered a reorganisation into larger urban centers.[8][note 3]\\r\\nAccording to J. G. Shaffer and D. A. Lichtenstein,[83] the Mature Harappan Civilisation was \\"a fusion of the Bagor, Hakra, and Kot Diji traditions or 'ethnic groups' in the Ghaggar-Hakra valley on the borders of India and Pakistan\\".[30]\\r\\nBy 2600 BCE, the Early Harappan communities turned into large urban centres. Such urban centres include Harappa, Ganeriwala, Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan, and Dholavira, Kalibangan, Rakhigarhi, Rupar, and Lothal in modern-day India.[84] In total, more than 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Indus Rivers and their tributaries.[citation needed]\\r\\nA sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture is evident in the Indus Valley Civilisation making them the first urban centre in the region. The quality of municipal town planning suggests the knowledge of urban planning and efficient municipal governments which placed a high priority on hygiene, or, alternatively, accessibility to the means of religious ritual.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs seen in Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and the recently partially excavated Rakhigarhi, this urban plan included the world's first known urban sanitation systems: see hydraulic engineering of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from wells. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets. Houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes. The house-building in some villages in the region still resembles in some respects the house-building of the Harappans.[85]\\r\\nThe ancient Indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in many areas of Pakistan and India today. The advanced architecture of the Harappans is shown by their impressive dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick platforms, and protective walls. The massive walls of Indus cities most likely protected the Harappans from floods and may have dissuaded military conflicts.[86]\\r\\nThe purpose of the citadel remains debated. In sharp contrast to this civilisation's contemporaries, Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, no large monumental structures were built. There is no conclusive evidence of palaces or templesor of kings, armies, or priests. Some structures are thought to have been granaries. Found at one city is an enormous well-built bath (the \\"Great Bath\\"), which may have been a public bath. Although the citadels were walled, it is far from clear that these structures were defensive. They may have been built to divert flood waters.[citation needed]\\r\\nMost city dwellers appear to have been traders or artisans, who lived with others pursuing the same occupation in well-defined neighbourhoods. Materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals, beads and other objects. Among the artefacts discovered were beautiful glazed fa?ence beads. Steatite seals have images of animals, people (perhaps gods), and other types of inscriptions, including the yet un-deciphered writing system of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods and most probably had other uses as well.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough some houses were larger than others, Indus Civilisation cities were remarkable for their apparent, if relative, egalitarianism. All the houses had access to water and drainage facilities. This gives the impression of a society with relatively low wealth concentration, though clear social levelling is seen in personal adornments. [clarification needed]\\r\\nToilets that used water were used in the Indus Valley Civilisation. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.[87]\\r\\nArchaeological records provide no immediate answers for a centre of power or for depictions of people in power in Harappan society. But, there are indications of complex decisions being taken and implemented. For instance, the majority of the cities were constructed in a highly uniform and well-planned grid pattern, suggesting they were planned by a central authority; extraordinary uniformity of Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery, seals, weights and bricks; presence of public facilities and monumental architecture; heterogeneity in the mortuary symbolism and in grave goods (items included in burials).[citation needed]\\r\\nThese are the major theories:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe people of the Indus Civilisation achieved great accuracy in measuring length, mass, and time. They were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measures. A comparison of available objects indicates large scale variation across the Indus territories. Their smallest division, which is marked on an ivory scale found in Lothal in Gujarat, was approximately 1.704?mm, the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the Bronze Age. Harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes, including the measurement of mass as revealed by their hexahedron weights.[88]\\r\\nThese chert weights were in a ratio of 5:2:1 with weights of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 units, with each unit weighing approximately 28?grams, similar to the English Imperial ounce or Greek uncia, and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of 0.871. However, as in other cultures, actual weights were not uniform throughout the area. The weights and measures later used in Kautilya's Arthashastra (4th century BCE) are the same as those used in Lothal.[89]\\r\\nHarappans evolved some new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin. The engineering skill of the Harappans was remarkable, especially in building docks.[90]\\r\\nIn 2001, archaeologists studying the remains of two men from Mehrgarh, Pakistan, discovered that the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, from the early Harappan periods, had knowledge of proto-dentistry. Later, in April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal Nature that the oldest (and first early Neolithic) evidence for the drilling of human teeth in vivo (i.e., in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh. Eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults were discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Mehrgarh that dates from 7,500ÿ9,000 years ago. According to the authors, their discoveries point to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region.[91]\\r\\nA touchstone bearing gold streaks was found in Banawali, which was probably used for testing the purity of gold (such a technique is still used in some parts of India).[92]\\r\\nVarious sculptures, seals, bronze vessels pottery, gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in terracotta, bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.[93]\\r\\nA number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form. These terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.[94]\\r\\nSir John Marshall reacted with surprise when he saw the famous Indus bronze statuette of a slender-limbed dancing girl in Mohenjo-daro:\\r\\n\\"When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric; they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art, and culture. Modeling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the Hellenistic age of Greece, and I thought, therefore, that some mistake must surely have been made; that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years older than those to which they properly belonged?.... Now, in these statuettes, it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling; that makes us wonder whether, in this all-important matter, Greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a far-off age on the banks of the Indus\\".[95]\\r\\nMany crafts including, \\"shell working, ceramics, and agate and glazed steatite bead making\\" were practised and the pieces were used in the making of necklaces, bangles, and other ornaments from all phases of Harappan culture. Some of these crafts are still practised in the subcontinent today.[96] Some make-up and toiletry items (a special kind of combs (kakai), the use of collyrium and a special three-in-one toiletry gadget) that were found in Harappan contexts still have similar counterparts in modern India.[97] Terracotta female figurines were found (ca. 2800ÿ2600 BCE) which had red colour applied to the \\"manga\\" (line of partition of the hair).[97]\\r\\nSeals have been found at Mohenjo-daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a yoga-like pose (see image, the so-called Pashupati, below).[citation needed] This figure, sometimes known as a Pashupati, has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.[98] If this can be validated, it would be evidence that some aspects of Hinduism predate the earliest texts, the Veda.[citation needed]\\r\\nA harp-like instrument depicted on an Indus seal and two shell objects found at Lothal indicate the use of stringed musical instruments. The Harappans also made various toys and games, among them cubical dice (with one to six holes on the faces), which were found in sites like Mohenjo-Daro.[99]\\r\\nThe Indus civilisation's economy appears to have depended significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The IVC may have been the first civilisation to use wheeled transport.[100] These advances may have included bullock carts that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can see on the Indus River today; however, there is secondary evidence of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and what they regard as a docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal in western India (Gujarat state). An extensive canal network, used for irrigation, has however also been discovered by H.-P. Francfort.[101]\\r\\nDuring 4300ÿ3200 BCE of the chalcolithic period (copper age), the Indus Valley Civilisation area shows ceramic similarities with southern Turkmenistan and northern Iran which suggest considerable mobility and trade. During the Early Harappan period (about 3200ÿ2600 BCE), similarities in pottery, seals, figurines, ornaments, etc. document intensive caravan trade with Central Asia and the Iranian plateau.[102]\\r\\nJudging from the dispersal of Indus civilisation artefacts, the trade networks, economically, integrated a huge area, including portions of Afghanistan, the coastal regions of Persia, northern and western India, and Mesopotamia. Studies of tooth enamel from individuals buried at Harappa suggest that some residents had migrated to the city from beyond the Indus Valley.[103] There is some evidence that trade contacts extended to Crete and possibly to Egypt.[104]\\r\\nThere was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations as early as the middle Harappan Phase, with much commerce being handled by \\"middlemen merchants from Dilmun\\" (modern Bahrain and Failaka located in the Persian Gulf).[105] Such long-distance sea trade became feasible with the development of plank-built watercraft, equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeveral coastal settlements like Sotkagen-dor (astride Dasht River, north of Jiwani), Sokhta Koh (astride Shadi River, north of Pasni), and Balakot (near Sonmiani) in Pakistan along with Lothal in western India, testify to their role as Harappan trading outposts. Shallow harbours located at the estuaries of rivers opening into the sea allowed brisk maritime trade with Mesopotamian cities.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome post-1980 studies indicate that food production was largely indigenous to the Indus Valley. It is known that the people of Mehrgarh used domesticated wheats and barley,[106] and the major cultivated cereal crop was naked six-row barley, a crop derived from two-row barley (see Shaffer and Liechtenstein 1995, 1999). Archaeologist Jim G. Shaffer (1999: 245) writes that the Mehrgarh site \\"demonstrates that food production was an indigenous South Asian phenomenon\\" and that the data support interpretation of \\"the prehistoric urbanisation and complex social organisation in South Asia as based on indigenous, but not isolated, cultural developments\\".\\r\\nIt has often been suggested that the bearers of the IVC corresponded to proto-Dravidians linguistically, the break-up of proto-Dravidian corresponding to the break-up of the Late Harappan culture.[107] Finnish Indologist Asko Parpola concludes that the uniformity of the Indus inscriptions precludes any possibility of widely different languages being used, and that an early form of Dravidian language must have been the language of the Indus people.[108] Today, the Dravidian language family is concentrated mostly in southern India and northern and eastern Sri Lanka, but pockets of it still remain throughout the rest of India and Pakistan (the Brahui language), which lends credence to the theory.\\r\\nAccording to Heggarty and Renfrew, Dravidian languages may have spread into the Indian subcontinent with the spread of farming.[109] According to David McAlpin, the Dravidian languages were brought to India by immigration into India from Elam.[note 9] In earlier publications, Renfrew also stated that proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent,[110][111][112][note 10] but more recently Heggarty and Renfrew note that \\"a great deal remains to be done in elucidating the prehistory of Dravidian.\\" They also note that \\"McAlpin's analysis of the language data, and thus his claims, remain far from orthodoxy.\\"[109] Heggarty and Renfrew conclude that several scenarios are compatible with the data, and that \\"the linguistic jury is still very much out.\\"[109][note 12]\\r\\nBetween 400 and as many as 600 distinct Indus symbols[117] have been found on seals, small tablets, ceramic pots and more than a dozen other materials, including a \\"signboard\\" that apparently once hung over the gate of the inner citadel of the Indus city of Dholavira.\\r\\nTypical Indus inscriptions are no more than four or five characters in length, most of which (aside from the Dholavira \\"signboard\\") are tiny; the longest on a single surface, which is less than 1?inch (2.54?cm) square, is 17 signs long; the longest on any object (found on three different faces of a mass-produced object) has a length of 26 symbols.\\r\\nWhile the Indus Valley Civilisation is generally characterised as a literate society on the evidence of these inscriptions, this description has been challenged by Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel (2004)[118] who argue that the Indus system did not encode language, but was instead similar to a variety of non-linguistic sign systems used extensively in the Near East and other societies, to symbolise families, clans, gods, and religious concepts. Others have claimed on occasion that the symbols were exclusively used for economic transactions, but this claim leaves unexplained the appearance of Indus symbols on many ritual objects, many of which were mass-produced in moulds. No parallels to these mass-produced inscriptions are known in any other early ancient civilisations.[119]\\r\\nIn a 2009 study by P. N. Rao et al. published in Science, computer scientists, comparing the pattern of symbols to various linguistic scripts and non-linguistic systems, including DNA and a computer programming language, found that the Indus script's pattern is closer to that of spoken words, supporting the hypothesis that it codes for an as-yet-unknown language.[120][121]\\r\\nFarmer, Sproat, and Witzel have disputed this finding, pointing out that Rao et al. did not actually compare the Indus signs with \\"real-world non-linguistic systems\\" but rather with \\"two wholly artificial systems invented by the authors, one consisting of 200,000 randomly ordered signs and another of 200,000 fully ordered signs, that they spuriously claim represent the structures of all real-world non-linguistic sign systems\\".[122] Farmer et al. have also demonstrated that a comparison of a non-linguistic system like medieval heraldic signs with natural languages yields results similar to those that Rao et al. obtained with Indus signs. They conclude that the method used by Rao et al. cannot distinguish linguistic systems from non-linguistic ones.[123]\\r\\nThe messages on the seals have proved to be too short to be decoded by a computer. Each seal has a distinctive combination of symbols and there are too few examples of each sequence to provide a sufficient context. The symbols that accompany the images vary from seal to seal, making it impossible to derive a meaning for the symbols from the images. There have, nonetheless, been a number of interpretations offered for the meaning of the seals. These interpretations have been marked by ambiguity and subjectivity.[123]:69\\r\\nPhotos of many of the thousands of extant inscriptions are published in the Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions (1987, 1991, 2010), edited by Asko Parpola and his colleagues. The final, third, volume, republished photos taken in the 1920s and 1930s of hundreds of lost or stolen inscriptions, along with many discovered in the last few decades. Formerly, researchers had to supplement the materials in the Corpus by study of the tiny photos in the excavation reports of Marshall (1931), MacKay (1938, 1943), Wheeler (1947), or reproductions in more recent scattered sources.\\r\\nEdakkal caves in Wayanad district of Kerala contain drawings that range over periods from as early as 5000 BCE to 1000 BCE. The youngest group of paintings have been in the news for a possible connection to the Indus Valley Civilisation.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe religion and belief system of the Indus Valley people have received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of Indian religions that later developed in the area. However, due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, and the fact that the Indus script remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later Hindu perspective.[124][125] An early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harapan sites[126] was that of John Marshall, who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus (linga) and vulva (yoni); and, use of baths and water in religious practice. Marshall's interpretations have been much debated, and sometimes disputed over the following decades.[127][128]\\r\\nOne Indus Valley seal shows a seated figure with a horned headdress, possibly tricephalic and possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals. Marshall identified the figure as an early form of the Hindu god Shiva (or Rudra), who is associated with asceticism, yoga, and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three eyes. The seal has hence come to be known as the Pashupati Seal, after Pashupati (lord of all animals), an epithet of Shiva.[127][129] While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. Doris Srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in Vedic literature Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.[130][131] Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with Mahisha, the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with vahanas (vehicles) of deities for the four cardinal directions.[132][133] Writing in 2002, Gregory L. Possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would be going too far.[129] Despite the criticisms of Marshall's association of the seal with a proto-Shiva icon, it has been interpreted as the Tirthankara Rishabhanatha by Jains and Vilas Sangave[134] or an early Buddha by Buddhists.[126] Historians such as Heinrich Zimmer and Thomas McEvilley believe that there is a connection between first Jain Tirthankara Rishabhanatha and the Indus Valley civilisation.[135][136]\\r\\nMarshall hypothesised the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines, and thought that this was a precursor of the Hindu sect of Shaktism. However the function of the female figurines in the life of Indus Valley people remains unclear, and Possehl does not regard the evidence for Marshall's hypothesis to be \\"terribly robust\\".[137] Some of the baetyls interpreted by Marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead, while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise yoni were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars, although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated.[138] Many Indus Valley seals show animals, with some depicting them being carried in processions, while others show chimeric creations. One seal from Mohenjo-daro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger, which may be a reference to the Sumerian myth of such a monster created by goddess Aruru to fight Gilgamesh.[139]\\r\\nIn contrast to contemporary Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations, Indus Valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge.[140][141] This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is widely thought to have been so used, as a place for ritual purification.[137][142] The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation are marked by their diversity, with evidence of supine burial, fractional burial (in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment), and even cremation.[143][144]\\r\\nAround 1800 BCE signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around 1700 BCE most of the cities had been abandoned. Recent examination of human skeletons from the site of Harappa has demonstrated that the end of the Indus civilisation saw an increase in inter-personal violence and in infectious diseases like leprosy and tuberculosis.[145][146]\\r\\nIn 1953 Sir Mortimer Wheeler proposed that the invasion of an Indo-European tribe from Central Asia, the \\"Aryans\\", caused the decline of the Indus Civilisation. As evidence, he cited a group of 37 skeletons found in various parts of Mohenjo-daro, and passages in the Vedas referring to battles and forts. However, scholars soon started to reject Wheeler's theory, since the skeletons belonged to a period after the city's abandonment and none were found near the citadel. Subsequent examinations of the skeletons by Kenneth Kennedy in 1994 showed that the marks on the skulls were caused by erosion, and not by violence.[147]\\r\\nSuggested contributory causes for the localisation of the IVC include changes in the course of the river,[148] and climate change that is also signalled for the neighbouring areas of the Middle East.[149][150] As of 2016[update] many scholars believe that drought and a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia caused the collapse of the Indus Civilisation.[151]\\r\\nThe Ghaggar-Hakra system was rain-fed,[5][note 2][152][note 13][153][note 14] and water-supply depended on the monsoons. The Indus Valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about 1800 BCE, linked to a general weakening of the monsoon at that time.[5] The Indian monsoon declined and aridity increased, with the Ghaggar-Hakra retracting its reach towards the foothills of the Himalaya,[5][154][155] leading to erratic and less extensive floods that made inundation agriculture less sustainable.\\r\\nAridification reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise, and to scatter its population eastward.[6][7][8][note 3] According to Giosan et al. (2012), the IVC residents did not develop irrigation capabilities, relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods. As the monsoons kept shifting south, the floods grew too erratic for sustainable agricultural activities. The residents then migrated towards the Ganges basin in the east, where they established smaller villages and isolated farms. The small surplus produced in these small communities did not allow development of trade, and the cities died out.[156]\\r\\nArchaeological excavations indicate that the decline of Harappa drove people eastward.[157] According to Possehl, after 1900 BCE the number of sites in today's India increased from 218 to 853. According to Andrew Lawler, \\"excavations along the Gangetic plain show that cities began to arise there starting about 1200 BCE, just a few centuries after Harappa was deserted and much earlier than once suspected.\\"[151] According to Jim Shaffer there was a continuous series of cultural developments, just as in most areas of the world. These link \\"the so-called two major phases of urbanisation in South Asia\\".[158]\\r\\nAt sites such as Bhagwanpura (in Haryana), archaeological excavations have discovered an overlap between the final phase of Late Harappan pottery and the earliest phase of Painted Grey Ware pottery, the latter being associated with the Vedic Culture and dating from around 1200 BCE. This site provides evidence of multiple social groups occupying the same village but using different pottery and living in different types of houses: \\"over time the Late Harappan pottery was gradually replaced by Painted Grey ware pottery,\\" and other cultural changes indicated by archaeology include the introduction of the horse, iron tools, and new religious practices.[159]\\r\\nThere is also a Harappan site called Rojdi in Rajkot district of Saurashtra. Its excavation started under an archaeological team from Gujarat State Department of Archaeology and the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania in 1982ÿ83. In their report on archaeological excavations at Rojdi, Gregory Possehl and M.H. Raval write that although there are \\"obvious signs of cultural continuity\\" between the Harappan Civilization and later South Asian cultures, many aspects of the Harappan \\"sociocultural system\\" and \\"integrated civilization\\" were \\"lost forever,\\" while the Second Urbanization of India (beginning with the Northern Black Polished Ware culture, c. 600 BCE) \\"lies well outside this sociocultural environment\\".[160]\\r\\nPreviously, scholars believed that the decline of the Harappan civilisation led to an interruption of urban life in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Indus Valley Civilisation did not disappear suddenly, and many elements of the Indus Civilisation appear in later cultures. The Cemetery H culture may be the manifestation of the Late Harappan over a large area in the south, and the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture its successor. David Gordon White cites three other mainstream scholars who \\"have emphatically demonstrated\\" that Vedic religion derives partially from the Indus Valley Civilisations.[161]\\r\\nAs of 2016[update], archaeological data suggests that the material culture classified as Late Harappan may have persisted until at least c. 1000ÿ900 BCE and was partially contemporaneous with the Painted Grey Ware culture.[158] Harvard archaeologist Richard Meadow points to the late Harappan settlement of Pirak, which thrived continuously from 1800 BCE to the time of the invasion of Alexander the Great in 325 BCE.[151]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the Indus Civilisation's localisation, regional cultures emerged, to varying degrees showing the influence of the Indus Civilisation. In the formerly great city of Harappa, burials have been found that correspond to a regional culture called the Cemetery H culture. At the same time, the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture expanded from Rajasthan into the Gangetic Plain. The Cemetery H culture has the earliest evidence for cremation; a practice dominant in Hinduism today.\\r\\nThe mature (Harappan) phase of the IVC is contemporary to the Early and Middle Bronze Age in the Ancient Near East, in particular the Old Elamite period, Early Dynastic to Ur III Mesopotamia, Prepalatial Minoan Crete and Old Kingdom to First Intermediate Period Egypt.\\r\\nThe IVC has been compared in particular with the civilisations of Elam (also in the context of the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis) and with Minoan Crete (because of isolated cultural parallels such as the ubiquitous goddess worship and depictions of bull-leaping).[162] The IVC has been tentatively identified with the toponym Meluhha known from Sumerian records; the Sumerians called them Meluhhaites.[163]\\r\\nShahr-i-Sokhta, located in southeastern Iran shows trade route with Mesopotamia.[164][165] A number of seals with Indus script have been also found in Mesopotamian sites.[165][166][167]\\r\\nAfter the discovery of the IVC in the 1920s, it was immediately associated with the indigenous Dasyu inimical to the Rigvedic tribes in numerous hymns of the Rigveda. Mortimer Wheeler interpreted the presence of many unburied corpses found in the top levels of Mohenjo-daro as the victims of a warlike conquest, and famously stated that \\"Indra stands accused\\" of the destruction of the IVC. The association of the IVC with the city-dwelling Dasyus remains alluring because the assumed timeframe of the first Indo-Aryan migration into India corresponds neatly with the period of decline of the IVC seen in the archaeological record. The discovery of the advanced, urban IVC however changed the 19th-century view of early Indo-Aryan migration as an \\"invasion\\" of an advanced culture at the expense of a \\"primitive\\" aboriginal population to a gradual acculturation of nomadic \\"barbarians\\" on an advanced urban civilisation, comparable to the Germanic migrations after the Fall of Rome, or the Kassite invasion of Babylonia. This move away from simplistic \\"invasionist\\" scenarios parallels similar developments in thinking about language transfer and population movement in general, such as in the case of the migration of the proto-Greek speakers into Greece, or the Indo-Europeanisation of Western Europe.\\r\\nProto-Munda (or Para-Munda) and a \\"lost phylum\\" (perhaps related or ancestral to the Nihali language)[168] have been proposed as other candidates for the language of the IVC. Michael Witzel suggests an underlying, prefixing language that is similar to Austroasiatic, notably Khasi; he argues that the Rigveda shows signs of this hypothetical Harappan influence in the earliest historic level, and Dravidian only in later levels, suggesting that speakers of Austroasiatic were the original inhabitants of Punjab and that the Indo-Aryans encountered speakers of Dravidian only in later times.[169]","input":"What led to the end of indus valley civilization?"},{"output":"Gina Tognoni","context":"Phyllis Summers is a fictional character from The Young and the Restless, an American soap opera on the CBS network. The character was created and introduced by William J. Bell, and debuted in the episode airing on October 17, 1994. Phyllis was originally and most notably portrayed by actress Michelle Stafford, until August 2013 (other than Sandra Nelson portraying Phyllis for nearly two years, until Stafford was brought back by former head writer, Kay Alden, in 2000). Stafford has been praised for her portrayal, for which she has won two Daytime Emmy Awards, but left the series after nearly sixteen years, with the character being written into a coma; Stafford last appeared on August 2, 2013. The role passed to Gina Tognoni (debuting on August 11, 2014), who continues in it.\\r\\nPhyllis was introduced as a groupie of fictional rock singer Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), and claimed to have given birth to his child, Daniel (Michael Graziadei). Danny married Phyllis out of obligation to his son, sparking a rivalry between Phyllis and Danny's ex-wife, Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell), which is a continuing storyline. The character is known for scheming to get what she wants. Phyllis has also been involved with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow); both relationships have fan followings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStafford made her debut on October 17, 1994. Her stint on the soap opera was initially a short-term role, however, her work impressed the producers and she was placed on contract.[1][2][3] On February 14, 1997, Stafford left the soap opera to pursue other career opportunities, and the role was recast with Sandra Nelson.[4][5] She portrayed the role from March 21, 1997, until February 22, 1999.[6][7] In July 2000, Stafford was brought back to the soap opera by former head writer Kay Alden, Stafford aired on July 13.[8] Speaking of her return, Stafford stated:[9]\\r\\nIn 2009, Stafford signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless which would ensure her portrayal of Phyllis for an unspecified period of time.[10] In May 2013, it was announced that Stafford would be exiting the soap opera after sixteen years in the role.[11] Stafford later confirmed that her final scenes would air sometime that August.[12]\\r\\nIn July 2013, Stafford appeared on the cover of Soap Opera Digest which was dubbed \\"Her Final Interview.\\" In the interview with editor Stephanie Sloane, she confessed that she was completely done with the soap opera, though wouldn't mind if the role of Phyllis was recast, stating: \\"They may, as a courtesy, ask if I wanted to come back; I don't know, they may not. It's okay with me. It doesn't matter because I am done. I'm completely done. And I'm not upset if they recast, I totally would understand.\\"[13][14] Stafford also stated she had some ideas for a recast, but would not detail the specifics of those ideas.[13]\\r\\nStafford also opened up as to her reasons for departing the series, stating, \\"There were other things that I really wanted to do. And the way that the show runs right now, the climate of daytime, the producers, the company, isnt so apt to be as accommodating with other projects. I dont say that as a criticism; as a producer, Id do the same. And recently, probably at the end of last year, I was considering it seriously. I think it coincided with my sister getting sick in September, and being a mother, and really thinking about life, the future and other things that I wanted to create, says Stafford on why she decided to leave the show. There were a lot of personal reasons that I just think are not important to share with the world. Only my good friends should know.\\"[14] Stafford exited the series on August 2, 2013.[14]\\r\\nIn May 2014, when Stafford joined the cast of General Hospital in the role of Nina Clay, the show went ahead with plans to recast the role of Phyllis. [15] On May 22, 2014, reports surfaced that former One Life to Live and Guiding Light actress Gina Tognoni had been cast in the role of Phyllis, following her \\"flawless\\" audition. Tognoni began taping on July 9[16] and made her debut on August 11, 2014.[17][18][19]\\r\\nWhen she debuted, Phyllis was known to scheme to get what she wanted. The Record said she is \\"usually scheming and she wouldn't have her any other way.\\"[3] Of her \\"damaged\\" familial background, Stafford stated: \\"I think Phyllis is looking for something she decided must exist in life that maybe doesnt. She is looking for something she never had, which is a family unit and real love. She is looking for that and she is thinking that it should be a certain way, because it is not what she had. In truth, that thing that she is looking for might not even exist. But she is trying to find it.\\"[20]\\r\\nPhyllis' first romance on the soap opera was with Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), whom she conned into believing he had fathered a child with her. During their loveless marriage, Stafford stated: \\"Phyllis is trying to figure out how to hold on to (her husband) Danny. Her shrink tells her, 'Don't exaggerate your sexuality.' But she doesn't get it. Danny isn't even the father of the baby. That's something that might come up later. But in the meantime, this woman is going to get him.\\" When he discovered her deception, a vicious divorce battle ensued.[21] They later briefly remarried before Danny obtained custody of Phyllis' son, Daniel, and left town with him. Upon her return in 2000, Phyllis began dating Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and they were later married. Of their romance, Bergman stated: \\"These two were perfectly wrong for each other. These two people cared about each other and wanted this to work in the worst possible way, but just couldnt make it work. That is not normal for soaps. It was fun to play and for the audience to watch, because these two people were desperately loving each other and they are destructive of each other, and someone is going to hurt someone here. These are two type A personalities.\\"[22] After being told more children weren't possible, Phyllis and Jack attempted to gain custody of Jack's son, Kyle Jenkins, from Diane Jenkins (Susan Walters), which failed and they eventually divorce in 2004.\\r\\nIn 2005, Phyllis and Jack reunited, just before she began an affair with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Nick used the affair to numb his emotions after his daughter's tragic death,[23] having been married to Sharon Newman (Sharon Case). A love triangle forms between the three characters, and while Nick initially returns to Sharon, Phyllis becomes pregnant and is unsure if Nick or Jack is the father. A paternity test supposedly revealed Nick as the father, and their daughter, Summer Newman (Hunter King), is born in December 2006,[24] and they are married in May 2007. Their three-year marriage eventually succumbs to Nick's ongoing feelings for Sharon, which resulted in an affair and the birth of their daughter, Faith. Nick divorces Phyllis in 2010. They briefly reunite and remarry in 2012, although it ends due to Phyllis' adultery and lies.[25][26][27] Morrow stated that \\"not many husbands would put up with what he has\\" in his marriages to Phyllis.[28] For the years following Summer's birth, speculation arose that Jack was in fact Summer's father, not Nick. In 2013, it was revealed that the paternity test conducted in 2006 was inconclusive.[29]\\r\\nPhyllis was born on June 14, 1974[30] in Darien, Connecticut to parents George Summers and Lydia Callahan.[30] She then ran away from home as a teenager for undisclosed reasons, leaving behind a younger sister who was revealed to be Avery Bailey Clark in 2011. In 1993, Phyllis gave birth to a son, Daniel, who was fathered by Brian Hamilton who wanted nothing to do with Phyllis or her unborn child. Thus, she conned Danny Romalotti into believing Daniel was his son, and he married her out of obligation. In 1995, her parents came to Genoa City to visit her but Phyllis chased them out of town.\\r\\nPhyllis arrived in Genoa City in 1994. She was a fan of rockstar Danny Romalotti, whom she drugged to get in bed with her. When she got pregnant, Phyllis altered the DNA results to show Danny as the father. Danny left his wife, Christine Blair, and married Phyllis, who gave birth to Daniel Romalotti Jr. Danny eventually left Phyllis. Intent on revenge, Phyllis ran down Christine and her fianc, Paul Williams. They survived. Danny and Phyllis underwent therapy. Phyllis had an affair with her psychiatrist, Tim Reid; and taped them having sex to blackmail him into telling the courts that Danny and Phyllis should not divorce. They divorced anyway and Phyllis was briefly engaged to Tim before reuniting with Danny. Eventually, Brian Hamilton was revealed to be Daniel's biological father; however, Danny fought for custody and won, leaving town with him. Phyllis later had relationships with Malcolm Winters, Michael Baldwin, and Jack Abbott, before leaving town. She returned as a web designer for Jabot Cosmetics, but was later fired and went to work for Newman Enterprises.\\r\\nPhyllis married Jack and they learned she was unable to have any more children. She and Jack tried to get custody of his son, Kyle Jenkins Abbott from Kyle's mother, Diane Jenkins, and Phyllis tried to get Diane out of their lives. Diane set Phyllis up to be jailed for arson and attempted murder, but Phyllis was released. She and Jack divorced. In 2004, Phyllis' son Daniel returned as a teenager and she eventually bonded with him as mother and son. Phyllis later reunited with Jack and began working with Nikki Newman on NVP, a new company funded by Newman Enterprises.\\r\\nShe then had an affair with Nick Newman while he was married to Sharon, and grieving the loss of their daughter Cassie. Phyllis became pregnant, and Nick divorced Sharon and then married Phyllis, who gave birth to Summer Newman. Phyllis blackmailed Brad Carlton over his own affair with Sharon, so he would vote for what she wanted on the Newman board. While on a business trip with Sharon and Drucilla Winters, the three women got into a fight, and Drucilla and Sharon fell off a cliff; Dru was never found. Phyllis went to jail for blackmailing Brad and Sharon. Nick was later involved in a plane crash and presumed dead. He showed up months later, with amnesia, believing he was still married to Sharon. He eventually regained his memory. Later, Phyllis, Nick, Jack, and Sharon develop a \\"Restless Style\\" magazine, but Jack and Sharon eventually leave. After witnessing Nick and Sharon kissing in Paris, Phyllis tried to get Brad to keep Sharon away from Nick. This failed, and Nick and Sharon had sex at the Abbott cabin. Sharon wound up pregnant, giving birth to Faith Newman. Phyllis divorces Nick due to his connection with Sharon.\\r\\nNick and Phyllis eventually reconnected, despite their divorce. Phyllis got custody of Daniel's daughter Lucy, who had been illegally adopted by Billy and Victoria Abbott. In 2012, Phyllis became pregnant and Nick proposed. Phyllis lost the baby, but they still got married. Their marriage was strained when Phyllis finally faced charges for running down Paul and Christine in December 1994. Phyllis' former therapist, Tim Reid, came to town and blackmailed Phyllis. When Tim dropped dead in Phyllis' apartment, she moved the body and then turned to Ronan Malloy for help. Her marriage to Nick ended when Phyllis slept with Ronan, also straining Phyllis' relationship with a teenaged Summer. Phyllis eventually regained a close relationship with her daughter, while also rekindling her romance with Jack.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2013, it was revealed that Nick had lied and claimed paternity over Summer, despite the original paternity test taken years before having been corrupted. He takes a second test, which still proves that he is the father. However, Sharon now wants Nick back, and tampers with the test results, allowing everyone to believe Jack is now the father of Summer. Phyllis ultimately hears Sharon confessing to this at Cassie's grave, resulting in an altercation between the two and ending with Phyllis falling down a flight of stairs. At the hospital, Phyllis briefly awakes with Jack at her side, and he proposes, but Phyllis is unresponsive. She then has a panic attack at the sight of Sharon in the window of the door. This causes her to relapse into a coma and is diagnosed with a bruise on her brain. This causes Daniel to request that she be moved to an experimental facility off the coast of where he resides, in Georgia. This is much to the dismay of Jack, Summer, and Avery, as they do not want her to be so far away. After much convincing, the group decides to try everything possible to help Phyllis, and agrees to send her to Georgia. Before leaving for Georgia, Jack is seen placing a ring on an unresponsive, comatose Phyllis to make their engagement official.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2014, Summer makes a visit to inform her mother that she has married Austin Travers (Matthew Atkinson). While she lay in her coma, Jack comes to visit Phyllis to tell her that he needed to see her one last time before he officially moves on with the new woman in his life, Kelly Andrews (Cady McClain). He also speaks with her doctor, who informs him that there has been very little change in Phyllis' condition over the past year, and there is very little that they can do. In an attempt to uncover Sharon's paternity test-switch secret, Victor goes to Georgia and gathers information about a risky form of medication that may be able to wake up patients who are in comas. The doctor later tells him that in order for the medication to be used, he would need the approval and signature of an immediate family member. Triggered by Victor's visit, Phyllis begins to display small responses of movement. After Victor secretly gets Summer to forge her signature on the required documents, Phyllis' doctor begins to administer the drug, and she emerges from her coma. Escaping the clinic, she hitchhikes her way back to Genoa City and crashes the wedding of Nick and Sharon. Phyllis' friends and family are thrilled that Phyllis is back. Kelly, however, is not due to the fact that Phyllis' return to Genoa City caused the termination of Kelly and Jack's relationship. In November, when Sharon is getting ready for her second attempt to get married to Nick, Phyllis shows up and tricks Sharon into going with her to the stairwell where Phyllis fell.\\r\\nIn September 2016, Phyllis and Jack divorced due to Phyllis and Billy's affair. Phyllis desperately tries to regain Jacks love and trust, but fails to do so and gives up in December 2016 after sharing a kiss. They now have a civil work relationship and continue to involve themselves in each others lives.\\r\\nIn August 2017, Phyllis and Benjamin Hochman create a plan to take down Vitoria Newman's company, Brash and Sassy so Phyllis can spend more time with Billy.\\r\\nStafford has been praised for her portrayal. In 1995, Lilana Novakovich of the Toronto Star stated: \\"Michelle Stafford is every bit as irrepressible as Phyllis Romalotti, her character on The Young and the Restless.\\"[31] The Sharon/Nick/Phyllis love triangle, which took place from 2006 to 2010, was considered one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, \\"In a perfect world, she'd wish [the baby was] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to.\\"[32] The love triangle was a prominent topic of soap opera debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled it \\"A can't-miss week for the popular Sharon/Nick/Phyllis triangle\\" when Phyllis's OB-GYN is to inform her that she is expecting.[33] On-Air On-Soaps has noted that both Phyllis' pairings with both Jack and Nick have garnered fan followings; they recognized her pairing with Nick as the \\"Phick vs. Shick\\" fan-base war.[34]\\r\\nStafford has received a number of honors for her portrayal of Phyllis, including Soap Opera Digest Award wins for Outstanding Female Newcomer in 1996,[35] for Outstanding Villainess in 1997[36][37] and for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2003,[38] earning another nomination in the same category in 2005.[39] Stafford also received a nomination for the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Female Scene Stealer in 2001.[40] She received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1996,[41] winning in 1997.[42] Stafford has also received eight nominations for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2003,[43] 2005,[44] 2007,[45] 2008,[46] 2010,[47] 2011,[47] 2013,[48] winning only once in 2004.[49] At the 32nd Daytime Emmy Awards, Stafford and co-star Peter Bergman were nominated for the Special Fan Award for Irresistible Combination.[2][50]\\r\\nIn 2015 and 2017 Tognoni gained a nomination for a Daytime Emmy in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category for her portrayal of Phyllis, winning in 2017[51]","input":"How many actresses have played phyllis on the young and the restless?"},{"output":"four-seamer","context":"Carsten Charles \\"CC\\" Sabathia, Jr. (born July 21, 1980) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees.\\r\\nSabathia played the first seven-and-a-half seasons of his career with the Indians, where he won the 2007 Cy Young Award. He played the second half of the 2008 MLB season with the Brewers, leading them to the Wild Card, their first playoff appearance in 26 years. In the offseason, Sabathia left via free agency and signed with the Yankees, where he led the Majors in wins in both 2009 and 2010 and helped lead them to the 2009 World Series title. Sabathia is regarded as one of the most durable pitchers in MLB, having amassed an average of over 200 innings pitched per season during his career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSabathia was born in Vallejo, California and attended Vallejo High School, where he excelled in baseball, basketball, and football. As a teenager, Sabathia played summer baseball in the Major League Baseball youth program, Reviving Baseball in Inner cities (RBI).[1] In baseball, he compiled a winÿloss record of 6ÿ0 with an 0.77 earned run average (ERA) with 14 hits, and 82 strikeouts in ?45?2?3 innings pitched during his senior season. Coming out of the draft he was the top high school prospect in Northern California according to Baseball America.\\r\\nIn football, he was an all-conference tight end. He received scholarship offers to play college football, including one from UCLA, and signed a letter of intent to attend the University of Hawai?i.[2]\\r\\nSabathia was drafted in the first round (20th overall) by the Indians in the 1998 MLB draft. He signed for a $1.3 million bonus.\\r\\nIn 2000, he was selected for the 28-man United States Olympic Team roster. He appeared in one pre-Olympic tournament game in Sydney, Australia, but was not on the official 24-man, Gold Medal-winning roster because he was called up by the Cleveland Indians. He was named the Indians' 2000 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the \\"Lou Boudreau Award\\").[3][4]\\r\\nIn 2001, he was the youngest player in the Major Leagues. Sabathia led the league in hits per 9 innings pitched (7.44), was third in the league in winÿloss percentage (17ÿ5, .773), fourth in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (8.53), sixth in wins, and seventh in strikeouts (171). He finished second in the AL voting for Rookie of the Year, behind future Yankees teammate Ichiro Suzuki.\\r\\nSabathia signed a four-year, $9.5 million contract with the Indians, with a club option for 2006, on February 23, 2002.[5] In the 2002 season, he was tenth in the AL in strikeouts, with 149 in 210 innings.[6] In 2003, he had the tenth-best ERA in the AL (3.60). He was also named to the American League All-Star team for the first time. Sabathia made his second All-Star selection in a row as he finished the 2004 season by going 11ÿ10 with a 4.12 ERA and 139 strikeouts.[6]\\r\\nThe Indians picked up their $7 million club option for 2006 on April 27, 2005 and Sabathia signed a two-year, $17.75 million deal.[7] In 2005, he was fourth in the AL in strikeouts/9 IP (7.37), seventh in strikeouts (161) and eighth in wins (15). This marked his fifth straight season of double digit wins to open a career. He threw the fastest fastball in the AL in 2005, averaging 94.7 miles per hour.[8] He also hit his first career home run as a batter in interleague play off of Ryan Dempster in May. The Indians went 20ÿ11 in his starts.\\r\\nIn 2006, he led the major leagues with 6 complete games. He also led the AL in shutouts (2), was third in ERA (3.22), sixth in strikeouts per 9 IP (8.03) and eighth in strikeouts (172). He became the first left-handed pitcher to start his career with six consecutive seasons of double digit wins.[9]\\r\\nSabathia collected his 1,000th career strikeout on May 21, fanning the player who beat him out for Rookie of the Year honors: Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. He was also named to the American League All-Star team for the third time. On September 28, he became the youngest pitcher (27 years, 69 days) to record 100 career wins since Greg Maddux in 1993. On October 23, Sabathia won the Players Choice Award for Outstanding AL Pitcher.[10] His pitching performance led the Cleveland Indians to their first American League Central Division Championship since 2001, his rookie season. For his performance, he was awarded the 2007 American League Cy Young Award joining Gaylord Perry as the only two Cleveland Indians pitchers to ever win the award. (Cliff Lee and Corey Kluber have since also won.) [11] Sabathia also won the Warren Spahn Award given to the best left-handed pitcher in the Majors.[12] Despite his strong regular season, Sabathia did not perform well against the Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. In two starts, he went 0ÿ2 with a 10.45 ERA.\\r\\nSabathia began the 2008 season 6ÿ8 with a 3.83 ERA in 18 starts. He was leading the American League in strikeouts (123) and strikeouts per 9.0 innings (9.05) while ranking second in innings pitched (122.1) and tied for second in complete games (3). However, with the Indians out of playoff contention, and with Sabathia an impending free agent, the Indians sought to trade Sabathia.\\r\\nAt the time Sabathia departed Cleveland, he was fifth in club history in strikeouts (1,265) and sixth in strikeouts per 9.0 innings (7.448), and his 2007 strikeouts-to-walks ratio was at the time a single-season best 5.649.[13]\\r\\nOn July 7, 2008, Sabathia was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Matt LaPorta, Michael Brantley, Zach Jackson and Rob Bryson.[14][15] During his press conference, Sabathia made it known to the assembled members of the media that he would prefer his name to be spelled \\"CC\\" rather than \\"C.C.\\"[16] He recorded his first win with the Brewers on July 8, 2008 against the Colorado Rockies. Sabathia was 17ÿ10 overall (11ÿ2 with Milwaukee) with a 2.70 ERA and was second in the majors (behind Tim Lincecum) with 251 strikeouts. Sabathia pitched three complete games in his first four starts with the Brewers, winning all four.\\r\\nOn July 30, 2008, Sabathia took out a large $12,870 ad in the sports section of Cleveland's daily newspaper, The Plain Dealer. The ad, signed by Sabathia, his wife Amber, and his family read:\\r\\nThank you for 10 great years ... You've touched our lives with your kindness, love and generosity. We are forever grateful! It's been a privilege and an honor![17]\\r\\nOn August 31, 2008, Sabathia threw what was ruled as a one-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates in PNC Park. The one hit for the Pirates came off of a check swing by Andy LaRoche in the fifth inning that rolled fair and was bobbled by Sabathia on an attempted bare-handed pickup. The team sent in an appeal to Major League Baseball to try to get the hit ruled as an error, but were unsuccessful.[18] Sabathia struck out eleven in the Brewers' 7ÿ0 win over the Pirates, making Sabathia's ninth complete game in the 2008 season. On September 28, 2008, Sabathia pitched a 4-hitter against the Cubs to win 3ÿ1 in the final game of the season, clinching the wild card for the Brewerstheir first-ever postseason berth as a National League club and their first since losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1982 World Series. It was Sabathia's 10th complete game of the year, the most complete games by any pitcher in a single season since Randy Johnson threw 12 in 1999. In 2008 Sabathia had the most effective slider among major league starting pitchers.[19] When batters swung at his pitches, they failed to make any contact 28% of the time, the highest percentage among major league starting pitchers.[20]\\r\\nSabathia started game 2 of the NLDS against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Brewers were heavily favored to win behind Sabathia, but Sabathia faltered, surrendering 5 runs in 3?2?3 innings, including a walk to the pitcher Brett Myers and a grand slam to Shane Victorino. The Phillies would go on to win the World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays.\\r\\nSabathia was sixth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols of the Cardinals, Ryan Howard of the Phillies, Ryan Braun also of the Brewers, Manny Ramirez of the Dodgers, and Lance Berkman of the Astros.[21]\\r\\nOn December 18, 2008, Sabathia signed a seven-year, $161 million contract with the New York Yankees. It was the largest contract for a pitcher in MLB history until 2013 when Flix Hernndez of the Seattle Mariners signed a seven-year $175 million contract.[22][23] On March 26, 2009, manager Joe Girardi announced that Sabathia would be the Opening Day starter and the starter for the home opener at the new Yankee Stadium.[24] Sabathia won his first championship ring with the Yankees, finishing 19ÿ8 with a 3.37 ERA and 197 strikeouts in 230 innings. Sabathia also won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) Most Valuable Player Award for his performance in the 2009 ALCS. Sabathia finished fourth in the AL Cy Young Award voting behind Zack Greinke, Flix Hernndez, and Justin Verlander.\\r\\nOn April 10, 2010, Sabathia took a no-hitter into the 8th inning. With two outs in the inning, former teammate Kelly Shoppach ripped a single to left field, ending the no-hit bid.[25] On July 4, he earned his fourth All-Star selection, and his first as a Yankee. On August 22, Sabathia recorded his 16th consecutive start of at least six innings allowing three earned runs or less, breaking a tie with Ron Guidry (from his Cy Young Award-winning 1978 season) for the longest streak in franchise history.[26] On September 18, he defeated the Baltimore Orioles to become baseball's first 20-game winner in 2010. The win also marks the first time he had ever won 20 games in a single season in his career.[27] Sabathia had won 19 games in a season twice previously: in 2007 with the Indians and 2009 in his first season with the Yankees. In 2010, Sabathia had a 21-7 record, recording a 3.18 ERA and 1.19 WHIP with 197 strikeouts in ?237?2?3 innings. He finished third in the AL Cy Young Award voting behind Flix Hernndez and David Price.\\r\\nDuring the offseason, Sabathia was diagnosed with a torn meniscus in his right knee, requiring arthroscopic surgery performed by Dr. Christopher Ahmad to repair. Sabathia began therapy immediately after the surgery and began his regular routine in preparation for spring training after three to six weeks.[28][29] He lost from 25 to 30 pounds to prevent future problems with his knee.[30]\\r\\nOn July 26, 2011, Sabathia took a perfect game through ?6?1?3 innings against the Seattle Mariners, retiring the first 19 batters he faced in a game interrupted twice due to rain. He ended up striking out 14 batters through 7 innings(setting a career high), and pitching another one-hitter, this one, a combined one-hitter. Sabathia was pulled before recording an out in the 8th after walking three batters to load the bases; relief pitchers David Robertson and Mariano Rivera finished the game, with Robertson allowing only one run (charged to Sabathia) on a double-play ground ball that would have ended the inning, but was bobbled by third baseman Eric Chavez.[31] For his performance in July 2011, Sabathia was named AL Pitcher of the Month. He posted a 4ÿ1 record with a 0.92 ERA during the month, striking out 50 batters and walking 13 in 39 innings. He also pitched two complete games and one shutout.[32] Sabathia recorded his 2,000th career strikeout on September 10, 2011 against Torii Hunter of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[33] In 2011, Sabatha had a 19ÿ8 record, 3.00 ERA, 230 strikeouts, ?237?1?3 innings pitched and a 1.21 WHIP.\\r\\nThough his contract contained an opt-out clause that allowed him to become a free agent after the 2011 season, Sabathia said he had no intention of exercising it as he loves playing for the New York Yankees and his family loves life in New York.[34][35] On October 31, 2011, Sabathia announced via his Twitter account that he would not be exercising his opt-out clause and had signed an extension with the Yankees. The extension was for an additional year on his original seven-year contract, worth $25 million, along with a $25 million vesting option with a $5 million buyout for the following year.[36][37] He finished fourth in Cy Young voting after the season.[38]\\r\\nSabathia began the 2012 season with bad footing as he allowed a grand slam by Carlos Pe?a in his first inning of work on opening day against the Tampa Bay Rays.[39] He recovered, however, going 9ÿ3 with a 3.55 ERA in his first 14 starts. He threw a complete game against the Atlanta Braves on June 18.[40]\\r\\nIn the 2012 American League Division Series, Sabathia won the first and fifth (deciding) games against the Baltimore Orioles, but lost Game Four of the ALCS, allowing the Detroit Tigers to sweep the Yankees. On October 25, 2012, Sabathia underwent arthroscopic surgery in his left elbow to remove a bone spur.[41]\\r\\nIn 2013, Sabathia's velocity decrease has caused him to be a pitcher that had to rely more on location rather than velocity.[citation needed] On July 3, 2013, Sabathia collected his 200th career win against the Minnesota Twins.[42] His season ended early due to a strained hamstring, finishing with a 14ÿ13 record and a career-high 4.78 ERA.[43]\\r\\nSabathia lost 40 pounds in 2013 and showed up to spring training in 2014 weighing 275 pounds. He admitted to crash dieting after a cousin of his died of heart disease in December 2012.[44][45]\\r\\nOn May 12, 2014, Sabathia was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right knee inflammation. Fluid buildup was detected in the knee and the buildup was drained by a shot with no surgery required. Seeking a second opinion with Dr. James Andrews, he received a stem-cell shot in the knee. Sabathia was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on July 1 (retroactive to May 11) being sidelined until early to mid-July or later. After making a rehab appearance with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, Sabathia began to experience swelling in his right knee, putting his season in jeopardy. The Yankees projected that Sabathia might need microfracture surgery, which could potentially end his career. On July 16, it was announced that Sabathia's 2014 season had ended. In only 8 starts in 2014, Sabathia went 3-4 with a 5.28 ERA. He underwent surgery on July 23 to repair his degenerated knee.[46]\\r\\nSabathia reported to spring training weighing 305 pounds (138?kg), as he believed his decreased weight contributed to his poor 2014 season.[47] During a game against the Angels on June 7, 2015, Sabathia recorded his 2,500th career strikeout but was later ejected along with Joe Girardi for getting into a confrontation with MLB umpire Dan Bellino following a double play.[48]\\r\\nSabathia went on the disabled list after leaving the game of August?23 with right knee soreness. He had a 4-9 record with a 5.27 ERA in 24 games started to that point.[49] He returned to the Yankees on September?9 wearing a knee brace.[50] He pitched to a 2.17 ERA in five starts after returning, including winning the game that clinched the Yankees a playoff berth in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game.[51]\\r\\nOn May 6, 2016, Sabathia was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left groin strain. On May 20, Sabathia recorded his 100th win as a New York Yankee in a 8-3 victory over the Oakland Athletics, going six innings, allowing one run and striking out eight.[52] Making 30 starts in 2016, Sabathia finished 9-12 with a 3.91 ERA in ?179?2?3 innings (30 starts) with 152 strikeouts. On October 11, Sabathia underwent surgery on his right knee, described as a routine cleanup.[53]\\r\\nOn June 13, Sabathia left the game after an apparent left hamstring injury. It was eventually revealed that his left hamstring was diagnosed with a Grade 2 strain, landing him on the disabled list.[54] He returned on July 4, starting against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium.[55] On July 21, Sabathia earned a win on his 37th birthday, throwing ?5?1?3 scoreless innings.[56] On August 1, Sabathia made his 500th career start in loss against the Detroit Tigers.[57] He was the second player in Major League history to make 500 starting pitching appearances in the regular season without ever appearing as a reliever; the feat was previously achieved by Tom Glavine.[58] On August 8, he was taken out of a game after the third inning after experiencing pain in his surgically repaired right knee.[59][60] On August 11, Sabathia landed on the 10-day disabled list again due to the lingering knee problem. He finished the season 14-5 with a 3.69 ERA, 120 strikeouts and a 1.27 WHIP in ?148?2?3 innings (27 starts). Sabathia was especially dominant in the role of the Yankee's stopper. In games following a Yankee's loss Sabathia went 9-0 with a 1.71 ERA in 11 starts, by far the best stats in both categories among pitchers who made at least seven starts following a team loss. Starting game 2 of the ALDS, Sabathia limited the Indians to earned runs in ?5?1?3 innings followed by 9 strikeouts against just two runs allowed in ?4?1?3 innings in game 5 as the Yankees advanced to the ALCS for the first time since 2012. Starting Game 3 of the ALCS Sabathia spun six shutout innings of three hit ball as the Yankees defeated the Astros 8-1. With the win Sabathia improved to 10-0 in with a 1.69 ERA in games started following Yankees losses (including the postseason).\\r\\nDespite throwing with his left hand as well as batting from the left, Sabathia is right-handed.[61] Sabathia has six pitches: a cutter (89ÿ92 MPH), a more used two-seam/sinker fastball (88ÿ93 MPH), a Four seam fastball (89-94 mph), a curve ball (74-76 MPH), a slider (78ÿ82 MPH),[62] and changeup (82ÿ84 MPH).[63] Once ahead in the count, he primarily uses his changeup to strike out right-handed batters, and his slider to strike out left-handers.[64] He also exhibits good command of his pitches, posting a 5.65 K/BB ratio in 2007.[65] Throughout most of his career, Sabathia's four-seam fastball sat in the 92-96 mph range (topping out at 98 mph) and his sinking fastball averaged 89-93 mph (topping out at 96 mph), thus making him a power pitcher. Since 2013, Sabathia has become accustomed to being a control pitcher, in the 2017 he cut down his usage of the four-seamer (87-91 mph topping out at 93 mph) and favored the sinker and cutter.\\r\\nSabathia holds a lifetime postseason record of 10 wins and 5 losses in 22 games (21 starts). He has pitched a total of 123 postseason innings, giving up 127 hits, 58 walks and 58 earned runs resulting in a 4.24 ERA. He also struck out 120 batters.[66]\\r\\nAs of the end of the 2017 season, Sabathia has acquired 25 hits in 124 plate appearances,[67] making him one of the more successful pitchers from a hitting standpoint. On one occasion, Sabathia hit a 440-foot home run on June 21, 2008, off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park.[68] He commented later, saying \\"I told everybody I was trying to hit homers today because I had two singles last year and everybody was all over me, saying I was a singles hitter. It was awesome.\\"[69] On July 13, 2008, in his second game with the Brewers, Sabathia hit his second home run of the season off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Homer Bailey, becoming the third pitcher in history to homer in both leagues in the same season and the first since Earl Wilson did it in 1970 with Detroit and San Diego.[70]\\r\\nSabathia's reputation of pitching a high number of effective innings each season has led to sports broadcasters often referring to him as a workhorse, discounting his injury-shortened 2014 campaign Sabathia has averaged over 200 innings a season in his career.[71] Sabathia has the most lifetime complete games (38 including 12 shutouts), innings pitched (3317) and strikeouts (2849) of any active pitcher as of 2017.\\r\\nSabathia and his wife, Amber, have four children: a son Carsten Charles III (born 2003), a daughter Jaeden Arie (born 2005), a daughter, Cyia (born 2008), and a son Carter (born 2010). The family lived in Fairfield, California outside his hometown of Vallejo, California near San Francisco until he signed with the Yankees. Then the family moved to Alpine, New Jersey. The family loves life in New Jersey and being so close to New York City.[72] Nevertheless, Sabathia remains connected to his hometown. On January 27, 2012, Vallejo High School honored Sabathia by declaring it \\"CC Sabathia Day\\" and renaming the school's baseball field in his honor.\\r\\nSabathia also appeared on a promotional video for Battlefield Bad Company 2 against \\"Random Grenade Throws\\" which showed him doing a public service announcement about random grenade throws. It spoofs the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 public service announcement with Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels. Sabathia remains very close friends with former teammates Cliff Lee and Prince Fielder.[73] Sabathia is a supporter of Crutches4Kids. He is an Oakland Raiders fan.\\r\\nSabathia operates a charity, the PitCChIn Foundation, which supports inner city children. In 2014, the foundation supported a team of runners in the 2014 New York City Marathon, consisting of Amber, the wife of Amar'e Stoudemire, Tiki Barber and Angie Martinez.[74]\\r\\nOn October 5, 2015, Sabathia announced that he was checking himself into an alcohol treatment center.[75] During the previous weekend, Sabathia had been binge drinking in the hotel while the Yankees were on the road in Baltimore, including drinking in the clubhouse after a game that had been cancelled due to rain.[76][77]","input":"What types of pitches does cc sabathia throw?"},{"output":"around 1280 CE","context":"","input":"When did humans first arrived in new zealand?"},{"output":"are privately owned corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships that have fewer employees and/or less annual revenue than a regular-sized business or corporation","context":"Small businesses are privately owned corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships that have fewer employees and/or less annual revenue than a regular-sized business or corporation. Businesses are defined as \\"small\\" in terms of being able to apply for government support and qualify for preferential tax policy varies depending on the country and industry. Small businesses range from fifteen employees under the Australian Fair Work Act 2009, fifty employees according to the definition used by the European Union, and fewer than five thousand employees, to qualify for many U.S. Small Business Administration programs. While small businesses can also be classified according to other methods, such as annual revenues, shipments, sales, assets, or by annual gross or net revenue or net profits, the number of employees is one of the most widely used measures.\\r\\nSmall businesses in many countries include service or retail operations such as convenience stores, small grocery stores, bakeries or delicatessens, hairdressers or tradespeople (e.g., carpenters, electricians), restaurants, guest houses, photographers, very small-scale manufacturing, and Internet-related businesses such as web design and computer programming. Some professionals operate as small businesses, such as lawyers, accountants, dentists and medical doctors (although these professionals can also work for large organizations or companies). Small businesses vary a great deal in terms of size, revenues and regulatory authorization, both within a country and from country to country. Some small businesses, such as a home accounting business, may only require a business license. On the other hand, other small businesses, such as day cares, retirement homes and restaurants serving liquor are more heavily regulated, and may require inspection and certification from various government authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers and analysts of small or owner-managed businesses generally behave as if nominal organizational forms (e.g., partnership, sole-trader, or corporation), and the consequent legal and accounting boundaries of owner-managed firms are consistently meaningful. However, owner-managers often do not delineate their behavior to accord with the implied separation between their personal and business interests. Lenders also often contract around organizational (corporate) boundaries by seeking personal guarantees or accepting privately held assets as collateral.[1] Because of this behavior, researchers and analysts may wish to be cautious in the way they assess the organizational types and implied boundaries in contexts relating to owner-managed firms. These include analyses that use traditional accounting disclosures, and studies that view the firm as defined by some formal organizational structure.\\r\\nThe term \\"entrepreneur\\" is often conflated with the term \\"small business\\" or used interchangeably with this term. While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner, or they have a small number of employees, and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service, and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service, and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales, and so on, a process which is financed by venture capital and angel investments. Successful entrepreneurs have the ability to lead a business in a positive direction by proper planning, to adapt to changing environments and understand their own strengths and weakness.[2]\\r\\nThe legal definition of \\"small business\\" varies by country and by industry. In the United States, the Small Business Administration establishes small business size standards on an industry-by-industry basis, but generally specifies a small business as having fewer than five hundred employees for manufacturing businesses and less than $7.5 million in annual receipts for most non manufacturing businesses.[3] The definition can vary by circumstance ÿ for example, a small business having fewer than twenty-five full-time equivalent employees with average annual wages below $50,000 qualifies for a tax credit under the health care reform bill Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[4]\\r\\nThe European Union generally defines a small business as one that has fewer than fifty employees. However, in Australia, a small business is defined by the Fair Work Act 2009 as one with fewer than fifteen employees. By comparison, a medium-sized business or mid-sized business has fewer than five hundred employees in the US, and fewer than two hundred in Australia.\\r\\nIn addition to number of employees, other methods used to classify small companies include annual sales (turnover), value of assets and net profit (balance sheet), alone or in a mixed definition. These criteria are followed by the European Union, for instance (headcount, turnover, and balance sheet totals). Small businesses are usually not dominant in their field of operation.[5]\\r\\nThe table below serves as a useful guide to business size nomenclature.\\r\\nBusiness size definitions (by number of employees)\\r\\nAccording to the US 2012 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) there are: 27.6 million businesses in the United States. 9.9 million of these businesses in the United States were owned or led by a woman, representing 35.9% of overall business ownership.[6]\\r\\nFranchising is a way for small business owners to benefit from the economies of scale of the big corporation (franchiser). McDonald's and Subway are examples of a franchise. The small business owner can leverage a strong brand name and purchasing power of the larger company while keeping their own investment affordable. However, some franchisees conclude that they suffer the \\"worst of both worlds\\" feeling they are too restricted by corporate mandates and lack true independence. It is an assumption that small business are just franchisees, but the truth is many franchisers are also small businesses, Although considered to be a successful way of doing business, literature has proved that there is a high failure rate in franchising as well, especially in UK, where research indicates that out of 1658 franchising companies operating in 1984, only 601 remained in 1998, a mere 36%.[7]\\r\\nA retailers' cooperative is a type of cooperative which employs economies of scale on behalf of its retailer members. Retailers' cooperatives use their purchasing power to acquire discounts from manufacturers and often share marketing expenses. It is common for locally owned grocery stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies to participate in retailers' cooperatives. Ace Hardware, True Value, and NAPA are examples of a retailers' cooperative.\\r\\nMany small businesses can be started at a low cost and on a part-time basis, while a person continues a regular job with an employer or provides care for family members in the home. In developing countries, many small businesses are sole-proprietor operations such as selling produce at a market stall or preparing hot food to sell on the street, that provide a small income. In the 2000s, a small business is also well suited to Internet marketing; because, it can easily serve specialized niches, something that would have been more difficult prior to the Internet revolution which began in the late 1990s. Adapting to change is crucial in business and particularly small business; not being tied to the bureaucratic inertia associated with large corporations, small businesses can respond to changing marketplace demand more quickly. Small business proprietors tend to be in closer personal contact with their customers and clients than large corporations, as small business owners see their customers in person each week.\\r\\nOne study showed that small, local businesses are better for a local economy than the introduction of new chain stores. By opening up new national level chain stores, the profits of locally owned businesses greatly decrease and many businesses end up failing and having to close. This creates an exponential effect. When one store closes, people lose their jobs, other businesses lose business from the failed business, and so on. In many cases, large firms displace just as many jobs as they create.[8]\\r\\nIndependence is another advantage of owning a small business. A small business owner does not have to report to a supervisor or manager. In addition, many people desire to make their own decisions, take their own risks, and reap the rewards of their efforts. Small business owners possess the flexibility and freedom to making their own decisions within the constraints imposed by economic and other environmental factors.[9] However, entrepreneurs have to work for very long hours and understand that ultimately their customers are their bosses.\\r\\nSeveral organizations in the United States also provide help for the small business sector, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource.[10] Small businesses (often carried out by family members) adjust quicker to the changing conditions; however, they are closed to the absorption of new knowledge and employing new labor from outside.[11]\\r\\nSmall businesses often face a variety of problems, some of which are related to their size. A frequent cause of bankruptcy is under capitalization. This is often a result of poor planning rather than economic conditions. It is a common \\"rule of thumb\\" that the entrepreneur should have access to a sum of money at least equal to the projected revenue for the first year of business in addition to his or her anticipated expenses. For example, if the prospective owner thinks that he or she will generate $100,000 in revenues in the first year with $150,000 in start-up expenses, then he or she should have not less than $250,000 available. Failure to provide this level of funding for the company could leave the owner liable for all of the company's debt should he or she end up in bankruptcy court, under the theory of under capitalization.\\r\\nIn addition to ensuring that the business has enough capital, the small business owner must also be mindful of contribution margin (sales minus variable costs). To break even, the business must be able to reach a level of sales where the contribution margin equals fixed costs. When they first start out, many small business owners under price their products to a point where even at their maximum capacity, it would be impossible to break even. Cost controls or price increases often resolve this problem.\\r\\nIn the United States, some of the largest concerns of small business owners are insurance costs (such as liability and health), rising energy costs, taxes, and tax compliance.[12] In the United Kingdom and Australia, small business owners tend to be more concerned with excessive governmental red tape.[13]\\r\\nContracting fraud has been an ongoing problem for small businesses in the United States. Small businesses are legally obligated to receive a fair portion (23 percent) of the total value of all the government's prime contracts as mandated by the Small Business Act of 1953. Since 2002, a series of federal investigations have found fraud, abuse, loopholes, and a lack of oversight in federal small business contracting, which has led to the diversion of billions of dollars in small business contracts to large corporations.\\r\\nAnother problem for many small businesses is termed the 'Entrepreneurial Myth' or E-Myth. The mythic assumption is that an expert in a given technical field will also be expert at running that kind of business. Additional business management skills are needed to keep a business running smoothly. Some of this misunderstanding arises from the failure to distinguish between small business managers as entrepreneurs or capitalists. While nearly all owner-managers of small firms are obliged to assume the role of capitalist, only a minority will act as entrepreneur.[14] The line between an owner-manager and an entrepreneur can be defined by whether or not their business is growth oriented. In general, small business owners are primarily focused on surviving rather than growing; therefore, not experiencing the five stages of the corporate life cycle (birth, growth, maturity, revival, and decline) like an entrepreneur would.[15]\\r\\nAnother problem for many small businesses is the capacity of much larger businesses to influence or sometimes determine their chances for success. Business networking and social media has been used as a major tool by small businesses in the UK, but most of them just use a \\"scatter-gun\\" approach in a desperate attempt to exploit the market which is not that successful.[16] Over half of small firms lack a business plan, a tool that is considered one of the most important factors for a venture's success. Business planning is associated with improved growth prospects. Funders and investors usually require a business plan. A plan also serves as a strategic planning document for owners and CEOs, which can be used as a \\"bible\\" for decision-making [17]\\r\\nAn international trade survey indicated that the British share of businesses which are exporting rose from 32% in 2012 to 39% in 2013. Although this may seem positive, in reality the growth is slow, as small business owners shy away from exporting due to actual and perceived barriers. Learning the basics of a foreign language could be the solution to open doors to new trade markets, it is a reality that not all foreign business partners speak English. China is stated to grow by 7.6% in 2013 and still sadly 95% of business owners who want to export to China have no desire and no knowledge to learn their local language.[18]\\r\\nWhen small business fails, the owner may file for bankruptcy. In most cases, this can be handled through a personal bankruptcy filing.[citation needed] Corporations can file bankruptcy, but if it is out of business and valuable corporate assets are likely to be repossessed by secured creditors, there is little advantage to going to the expense of a corporate bankruptcy.[citation needed] Many states offer exemptions for small business assets so they can continue to operate during and after personal bankruptcy.[citation needed] However, corporate assets are normally not exempt; hence, it may be more difficult to continue operating an incorporated business if the owner files bankruptcy.[citation needed] Researchers have examined small business failures in some depth, with attempts to model the predictability of failure.[19][20]\\r\\nSmall businesses can encounter several problems related to engaging in corporate social responsibility, due to characteristics inherent in their size. Owners of small businesses often participate heavily in the day-to-day operations of their companies. This results in a lack of time for the owner to coordinate socially responsible efforts, such as supporting local charities or not-for-profit activities.[21] Additionally, a small business owner's expertise often falls outside the realm of socially responsible practices, which contributing to a lack of participation. Small businesses also face a form of peer pressure from larger forces in their respective industries, making it difficult to oppose and work against industry expectations.[21] Furthermore, small businesses undergo stress from shareholder expectations. Because small businesses have more personal relationships with their patrons and local shareholders, they must also be prepared to withstand closer scrutiny if they want to share in the benefits of committing to socially responsible practices or not. [21]\\r\\nWhile small businesses employ over half the workforce in the US [22] and have been established as a main driving force behind job creation,[23] the quality of the jobs these businesses create has been called into question. Small businesses generally employ individuals from the Secondary labour market. As a result, in the U.S., wages are 49% higher for employees of large firms.[23] Additionally, many small businesses struggle or are unable to provide employees with benefits they would be given at larger firms. Research from the U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that employees of large firms are 17% more likely to receive benefits including salary, paid leave, paid holidays, bonuses, insurance, and retirement plans.[24] Both lower wages and fewer benefits combine to create a job turnover rate among U.S. small businesses that is three times higher than large firms.[23] Employees of small businesses also must adapt to the higher failure rate of small firms, which means that they are more likely to lose their job due to the firm going under. In the U.S. 69% of small businesses last at least two years, but this percentage drops to 51% for firms reaching five years in operation.[22] The U.S. Small Business Administration counts companies with as much as $35.5 million in sales and 1,500 employees as \\"small businesses\\", depending on the industry. Outside government, companies with less than $7 million in sales and fewer than five hundred employees are widely considered small businesses.\\r\\nAlthough small business have close relationships with their existing customers, finding new customers and reaching new markets is a major challenge for small business owners. Small businesses typically find themselves strapped for time to do marketing, as they have to run the day-to-day aspects of the business. To create a continual stream of new business and find new clients and customers, they must work on marketing their business each week.[citation needed] Common marketing techniques for small business include business networking (e.g., attending Chamber of Commerce events or trade fairs), \\"word of mouth\\" promotion by existing customers, customer referrals, Yellow pages directories, television, radio, and outdoor ads (e.g., roadside billboards), print ads, and Internet marketing. TV ads can be quite expensive, so they are normally intended to create awareness of a product or service. Another means by which small businesses can advertise is through the use of \\"deal of the day\\" websites such as Groupon and Living Social. These Internet deals encourage customers to patronize small businesses.\\r\\nMany small business owners find internet marketing more affordable. Google AdWords and Yahoo! Search Marketing are two popular options of getting small business products or services in front of motivated web searchers. Social media has also become an afforable route of marketing for small business. It is a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing and small businesses are able to do it themselves or find small social marketing agencies that they can hire out for a small fee. Statistically, social media marketing has a higher lead-to-close rate than traditional media.[citation needed] Successful online small business marketers are also adept at utilizing the most relevant keywords in their website content. Advertising on niche websites that are frequented by potential customers can also be effective, but with the long tail of the Internet, it can be time intensive to advertise on enough websites to garner an effective reach.\\r\\nCreating a business website has become increasingly affordable with many do-it-yourself programs now available for beginners. A website can provide significant marketing exposure for small businesses when marketed through the Internet and other channels. Some popular services are WordPress, Joomla Squarespace, and EXAI . Social media has proven to be very useful in gaining additional exposure for many small businesses. Many small business owners use Facebook and Twitter as a way to reach out to their loyal customers to give them news about specials of the day or special coupons, generate repeat business and reach out to new potential clients. The relational nature of social media, along with its immediacy and twenty-four-hour presence lend intimacy to the relationships small businesses can have with their customers, while making it more efficient for them to communicate with greater numbers. Facebook ads are also a very cost-effective way for small businesses owners to reach a targeted audience with a very specific message. In addition to the social networking sites, blogs have become a highly effective way for small businesses to position themselves as experts on issues that are important to their customers. This can be done with a proprietary blog and/or by using a back-link strategy wherein the marketer comments on other blogs and leaves a link to the small business' own website. Posting to a blog about the company's business or service area regularly can increase web traffic to a company website.\\r\\nMarketing plan\\r\\nIn the US, small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) account for more than half the non-farm, private GDP and around half the private sector employment.[22] Regarding small business, the top job provider is those with fewer than ten employees, and those with ten or more but fewer than twenty employees comes in as the second, and those with twenty or more but fewer than one hundred employees comes in as the third (interpolation of data from the following references).[27] The most recent data shows firms with fewer than twenty employees account for slightly more than 18% of the employment.[28]\\r\\nAccording to \\"The Family Business Review,\\" \\"There are approximately seventeen million sole-proprietorship in the US. It can be argued that a sole-proprietorship (an unincorporated business owned by a single person) is a type of family business\\" and \\"there are twenty-two million small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) in the US and approximately 14,000 big businesses.\\" Also, it has been found that small businesses created the most new jobs in communities, \\"In 1979, David Birch published the first empirical evidence that small firms (fewer than 100 employees) created the most new jobs\\", and Edmiston claimed that \\"perhaps the greatest generator of interest in entrepreneurship and small business is the widely held belief that small businesses in the United States create most new jobs. The evidence suggests that small businesses indeed create a substantial majority of net new jobs in an average year.\\" Local businesses provide competition to each other and also challenge corporate giants. Of the 5,369,068 employer firms in 1995, 78.8 percent had fewer than ten employees, and 99.7 percent had fewer than five hundred employees.[29]\\r\\nSmall businesses use various sources available for start-up capital:\\r\\nSome small businesses are further financed through credit card debtusually a poor choice, given that the interest rate on credit cards is often several times the rate that would be paid on a line of credit at a bank or a bank loan. Recent research suggests that the use of credit scores in small business lending by community banks is surprisingly widespread. Moreover, the scores employed tend to be the consumer credit scores of the small business owners rather than the more encompassing small business credit scores that include data on the firms as well as on the owners.[30] Many owners seek a bank loan in the name of their business; however, banks will usually insist on a personal guarantee by the business owner.\\r\\nIn the United States, the Small Business Administration (SBA) runs several loan programs that may help a small business secure loans. In these programs, the SBA guarantees a portion of the loan to the issuing bank, and thus, relieves the bank of some of the risk of extending the loan to a small business. The SBA also requires business owners to pledge personal assets and sign as a personal guarantee for the loan. The 8(a) Business Development Program assists in the development of small businesses owned and operated by African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians.[31] Canadian small businesses can take advantage of federally funded programs and services. See Federal financing for small businesses in Canada (grants and loans).\\r\\nOn October 2010, Alejandro Cremades and Tanya Prive founded the first equity crowdfunding platform[32] for small businesses in history as an alternative source of financing. The platform operates under the name of Rock The Post.[33]\\r\\nSmall businesses often join or come together to form organizations to advocate for their causes or to achieve economies of scale that larger businesses benefit from, such as the opportunity to buy cheaper health insurance in bulk. These organizations include local or regional groups such as Chambers of Commerce and independent business alliances, as well as national or international industry-specific organizations. Such groups often serve a dual purpose, as business networks to provide marketing and connect members to potential sales leads and suppliers, and also as advocacy groups, bringing together many small businesses to provide a stronger voice in regional or national politics. In the case of independent business alliances, promoting the value of locally owned, independent business (not necessarily small) through public education campaigns is integral to their work.\\r\\nThe largest regional small business group in the United States is the Council of Smaller Enterprises, located in Greater Cleveland.[34] United Kingdom trade and Investment (www.ukti.gov.in) gives out research in different markets around the world, also research in program planning and promotional activities to exporters. The BEXA (British Exporters Association) role is to connect new exporters to expert services, it can provide details about regional export contacts, who could be made informally to discuss issues. Trade associations and all major banks could often provide links to international groups in foreign markets, some could also help set up joint venture, trade fairs etc.[35]\\r\\nA number of youth organizations, including 4-H, Junior Achievement, and Scouting have special interactive programs and training to help young people run their own small business under adult supervision.[36]","input":"When is a company considered a small business?"},{"output":"Formula Rossa","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nRoller coasters are amusement rides developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first roller coasters, where the train was attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s.[1] Although wooden roller coasters are still being produced, steel roller coasters are more common and can be found on every continent except Antarctica.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nRanked by height, speed, length, inversions, and steepness, roller coasters are also rated through public opinion polls. Amusement parks often compete to build the tallest, fastest, and longest rides to attract thrill seekers and boost overall park attendance.[3] However, many records do not usually last long. When Magnum XL-200 opened in 1989, it began a new era of roller coasters and increased competition among parks to set new world records. The Magnum XLÿ200 was the first complete-circuit roller coaster built over 200 feet (61?m).[4][5] Other notable roller coasters include Formula Rossa which reaches a top speed of 149 miles per hour (240?km/h),[6] Kingda Ka which stands at 456 feet (139?m) tall,[7] and Steel Dragon 2000 which measures 8,133 feet (2,479?m) in length.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis listing contains all types of roller coaster inversions.","input":"What is the fastest roller coaster in california?"},{"output":"spring","context":"A season is a division of the year[1] marked by changes in weather, ecology, and amount of daylight. Seasons result from Earth's orbit around the Sun and Earth's axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane.[2][3] In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.\\r\\nDuring May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.\\r\\nIn temperate and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn or fall, and winter. Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions: prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal, and hibernal. Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, wet, or monsoon season and the dry season. Some have a third cool, mild, or harmattan season. Seasons often held special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolved around planting and harvest times, and the change of seasons was often attended by ritual.\\r\\nIn some parts of the world, some other \\"seasons\\" capture the timing of important ecological events such as hurricane season, tornado season, and wildfire season.[citation needed] The most historically important of these are the three seasonsflood, growth, and low waterwhich were previously defined by the former annual flooding of the Nile in Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seasons result from the Earth's axis of rotation being tilted with respect to its orbital plane by an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees.[4] (This tilt is also known as \\"obliquity of the ecliptic\\".)\\r\\nRegardless of the time of year, the northern and southern hemispheres always experience opposite seasons. This is because during summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see Fig. 1) than the other, and this exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. For approximately half of the year (from around March 20 to around September 22), the northern hemisphere tips toward the Sun, with the maximum amount occurring on about June 21. For the other half of the year, the same happens, but in the southern hemisphere instead of the northern, with the maximum around December 21. The two instants when the Sun is directly overhead at the Equator are the equinoxes. Also at that moment, both the North Pole and the South Pole of the Earth are just on the terminator, and hence day and night are equally divided between the northern and southern hemispheres. Around the March equinox, the northern hemisphere will be experiencing spring as the hours of daylight increase, and the southern hemisphere is experiencing autumn as daylight hours shorten.\\r\\nThe effect of axial tilt is observable as the change in day length and altitude of the Sun at noon (the culmination of the Sun) during a year. The low angle of Sun during the winter months means that incoming rays of solar radiation are spread over a larger area of the Earth's surface, so the light received is more indirect and of lower intensity. Between this effect and the shorter daylight hours, the axial tilt of the Earth accounts for most of the seasonal variation in climate in both hemispheres.\\r\\nIllumination of Earth by Sun at the northern solstice.\\r\\nIllumination of Earth by Sun at the southern solstice.\\r\\nDiagram of the Earth's seasons as seen from the north.

Far left: northern solstice\\r\\nAnimation of Earth as seen daily from the Sun looking at UTC+02:00, showing the solstice and changing seasons.\\r\\nTwo images showing the amount of reflected sunlight at southern and northern summer solstices respectively (watts / m2).\\r\\nCompared to axial tilt, other factors contribute little to seasonal temperature changes. The seasons are not the result of the variation in Earth's distance to the sun because of its elliptical orbit.[5] In fact, Earth reaches perihelion (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches aphelion (farthest point from the Sun) in July, so the slight contribution of orbital eccentricity opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the northern hemisphere.[6] In general, the effect of orbital eccentricity on Earth's seasons is a 7% variation in sunlight received.\\r\\nOrbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when farther from the sun. This is because the northern hemisphere has more land than the southern, and land warms more readily than sea.[6] Any noticeable intensification of the southern hemisphere's winters and summers due to Earth's elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the southern hemisphere.[7]\\r\\nSeasonal weather fluctuations (changes) also depend on factors such as proximity to oceans or other large bodies of water, currents in those oceans, El Ni?o/ENSO and other oceanic cycles, and prevailing winds.\\r\\nIn the temperate and polar regions, seasons are marked by changes in the amount of sunlight, which in turn often causes cycles of dormancy in plants and hibernation in animals. These effects vary with latitude and with proximity to bodies of water. For example, the South Pole is in the middle of the continent of Antarctica and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans. The North Pole is in the Arctic Ocean, and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water. The result is that the South Pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the North Pole during the northern winter.\\r\\nThe cycle of seasons in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that in the other. When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.\\r\\nIn tropical and subtropical regions there is little annual fluctuation of sunlight. However, there are seasonal shifts of a rainy global-scale low pressure belt called the Intertropical convergence zone. As a result, the amount of precipitation tends to vary more dramatically than the average temperature. When the convergence zone is north of the equator, the tropical areas of the northern hemisphere experience their wet season while the tropics south of the equator have their dry season. This pattern reverses when the convergence zone migrates to a position south of the equator.\\r\\nIn meteorological terms, the summer solstice and winter solstice (or the maximum and minimum insolation, respectively) do not fall in the middles of summer and winter. The heights of these seasons occur up to seven weeks later because of seasonal lag. Seasons, though, are not always defined in meteorological terms.\\r\\nIn astronomical reckoning by hours of daylight alone, the solstices and equinoxes are in the middle of the respective seasons. Because of seasonal lag due to thermal absorption and release by the oceans, regions with a continental climate which predominate in the northern hemisphere often consider these four dates to be the start of the seasons as in the diagram, with the cross-quarter days considered seasonal midpoints. The length of these seasons is not uniform because of the elliptical orbit of the earth and its different speeds along that orbit.[8]\\r\\nCalendar-based reckoning defines the seasons in absolute rather than relative terms. Accordingly, if floral activity is regularly observed during the coolest quarter of the year in a particular area, it is still considered winter despite the traditional association of flowers with spring and summer. Additionally, the seasons are considered to change on the same dates everywhere that uses a particular calendar method regardless of variations in climate from one area to another. Most calendar-based methods use a four-season model to identify the warmest and coldest seasons, which are separated by two intermediate seasons.\\r\\nMeteorological seasons are reckoned by temperature, with summer being the hottest quarter of the year and winter the coldest quarter of the year. In 1780 the Societas Meteorologica Palatina (which became defunct in 1795), an early international organization for meteorology, defined seasons as groupings of three whole months as identified by the Gregorian calendar. Ever since, professional meteorologists all over the world have used this definition.[9] Therefore, for temperate areas in the northern hemisphere, spring begins on 1 March, summer on 1 June, autumn on 1 September, and winter on 1 December. For the southern hemisphere temperate zone, spring begins on 1 September, summer on 1 December, autumn on 1 March, and winter on 1 June.[10][11] In Australasia the meteorological terms for seasons apply to the temperate zone that occupies all of New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, the south-eastern corner of South Australia and the south-west of Western Australia, and the south east Queensland areas south of Brisbane.\\r\\nIn Sweden and Finland, meteorologists use a non-calendar based definition for the seasons based on the temperature. Spring begins when the daily averaged temperature permanently rises above 0?C, summer begins when the temperature permanently rises above +10?C, summer ends when the temperature permanently falls below +10?C and winter begins when the temperature permanently falls below 0?C. \\"Permanently\\" here means that the daily averaged temperature has remained above or below the limit for seven consecutive days. This implies two things: first, the seasons do not begin at fixed dates but must be determined by observation and are known only after the fact; and second, a new season begins at different dates in different parts of the country. In Great Britain, the onset of spring used to be defined as when the maximum daily temperature reached 50?F (10?C) in a defined sequence of days. This almost always occurred in March. However, with global warming this temperature is now not uncommon in the winter.\\r\\nAstronomical timing as the basis for designating the temperate seasons dates back at least to the Julian calendar used by the ancient Romans. It continues to be used on many modern Gregorian calendars worldwide, although some countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning. The precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn for the solstices and the times of the sun's transit over the equator for the equinoxes, or a traditional date close to these times.[15]\\r\\nThe following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of apsides of Earth's elliptical orbit. The orbital ellipse (with eccentricity exaggerated for effect) goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the perihelion (periapsisnearest point to the sun) on anywhere from 2 January to 5 January, the point of March equinox on 19, 20 or 21 March, the point of June solstice on 20 or 21 June, the aphelion (apoapsisfarthest point from the sun) on anywhere from 4 July to 7 July, the September equinox on 22 or 23 September, and the December solstice on 21 or 22 December.\\r\\nThese \\"astronomical\\" seasons are not of equal length, because of the elliptical nature of the orbit of the Earth, as discovered by Johannes Kepler. From the March equinox it currently takes 92.75 days until the June solstice, then 93.65 days until the September equinox, 89.85 days until the December solstice and finally 88.99 days until the March equinox.\\r\\nThe times of the equinoxes and solstices are not fixed with respect to the modern Gregorian calendar, but fall about six hours later every year, amounting to one full day in four years. They are reset by the occurrence of a leap year. The Gregorian calendar is designed to keep the March equinox no later than 21 March as accurately as is practical. Also see: Gregorian calendar seasonal error.\\r\\nThe calendar equinox (used in the calculation of Easter) is 21 March, the same date as in the Easter tables current at the time of the Council of Nicaea in AD 325. The calendar is therefore framed to prevent the astronomical equinox wandering onto 22 March. From Nicaea to the date of the reform, the years 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400 and 1500, which would not have been leap years in the Gregorian calendar, amount to nine days, but astronomers directed that ten days be removed.\\r\\nCurrently, the most common equinox and solstice dates are March 20, June 21, September 22 or 23 and December 21; the four-year average slowly shifts to earlier times as the century progresses. This shift is a full day in about 128 years (compensated mainly by the century \\"leap year\\" rules of the Gregorian calendar) and as 2000 was a leap year the current shift has been progressing since the beginning of the last century, when equinoxes and solstices were relatively late. This also means that in many years of the twentieth century, the dates of March 21, June 22, September 23 and December 22 were much more common, so older books teach (and older people may still remember) these dates.\\r\\nNote that all the times are given in UTC (roughly speaking, the time at Greenwich, ignoring British Summer Time). People living farther to the east (Asia and Australia), whose local times are in advance, will see the astronomical seasons apparently start later; for example, in Tonga (UTC+13), an equinox occurred on September 24, 1999, a date which will not crop up again until 2103. On the other hand, people living far to the west (America) whose clocks run behind UTC may experience an equinox as early as March 19.\\r\\nOver thousands of years, the Earth's axial tilt and orbital eccentricity vary (see Milankovitch cycles). The equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars while the perihelion and aphelion move eastward. Thus, ten thousand years from now Earth's northern winter will occur at aphelion and northern summer at perihelion. The severity of seasonal change  the average temperature difference between summer and winter in location  will also change over time because the Earth's axial tilt fluctuates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.\\r\\nSmaller irregularities in the times are caused by perturbations of the Moon and the other planets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar timing is based on insolation in which the solstices and equinoxes are seen as the midpoints of the seasons. It was the method for reckoning seasons in medieval Europe, especially by the Celts, and is still ceremonially observed in some east Asian countries. Summer is defined as the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter as the quarter with the least.\\r\\nThe solar seasons change at the cross-quarter days, which are about 3ÿ4 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 6ÿ7 weeks earlier than seasons starting at equinoxes and solstices. Thus, the day of greatest insolation is designated \\"midsummer\\" as noted in William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream, which is set on the summer solstice. On the Celtic calendar, the traditional first day of winter is 1 November (Samhain, the Celtic origin of Halloween); spring starts 1 February (Imbolc, the Celtic origin of Groundhog Day); summer begins 1 May (Beltane, the Celtic origin of May Day); the first day of autumn is 1 August (Celtic Lughnasadh). The Celtic dates corresponded to four Pagan agricultural festivals.\\r\\nThe traditional calendar in China forms the basis of other such systems in East Asia. Its seasons are traditionally based on 24 periods known as solar terms.[16] The four seasons chn (), xi (G), qi (), and dng () are universally translated as \\"spring\\", \\"summer\\", \\"autumn\\", and \\"winter\\" but actually begin much earlier, with the solstices and equinoxes forming the midpoint of each season rather than their start. Astronomically, the seasons are said to begin on Lichun (پ, lit.?\\"standing spring\\") on about 4 February, Lixia (٪G) on about 6 May, Liqiu (٢) on about 8 August, and Lidong () on about 7 November. These dates were not part of the traditional lunar calendar, however, and moveable holidays such as Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival are more closely associated with the seasons.\\r\\nSome calendars in south Asia use a six-season method where the number of seasons between summer and winter can number from one to three. The dates are fixed at even intervals of months.\\r\\nIn the Hindu calendar of tropical and subtropical India, there are six seasons or Ritu that are calendar-based in the sense of having fixed dates: Vasanta (spring), Greeshma (summer), Varsha (monsoon), Sharad (autumn), Hemanta (early winter), and Shishira (prevernal or late winter). The six seasons are ascribed to two months each of the twelve months in the Hindu calendar. The rough correspondences are:\\r\\nThe Bengali Calendar is similar but differs in start and end time. It has the following seasons or ritu:\\r\\nThe Tamil calendar follows a similar pattern of six seasons\\r\\nAny point north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle will have one period in the summer when the sun does not set, and one period in the winter when the sun does not rise. At progressively higher latitudes, the maximum periods of \\"midnight sun\\" and \\"polar night\\" are progressively longer.\\r\\nFor example, at the military and weather station Alert located at 823005N and 622020W, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island, Canada (about 450 nautical miles or 830?km from the North Pole), the sun begins to peek above the horizon for minutes per day at the end of February and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer; by 21 March, the sun is up for over 12 hours. On 6 April the sun rises at 0522 UTC and remains above the horizon until it sets below the horizon again on 6 September at 0335 UTC. By October 13 the sun is above the horizon for only 1 hour 30 minutes and on October 14 it does not rise above the horizon at all and remains below the horizon until it rises again on 27 February.[17]\\r\\nFirst light comes in late January because the sky has twilight, being a glow on the horizon, for increasing hours each day, for more than a month before the sun first appears with its disc above the horizon. From mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight.\\r\\nIn the weeks surrounding 21 June, in the northern polar region, the sun is at its highest elevation, appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon. Eventually, it does go below the horizon, for progressively longer periods each day until around the middle of October, when it disappears for the last time until the following February. For a few more weeks, \\"day\\" is marked by decreasing periods of twilight. Eventually, from mid-November to mid-January, there is no twilight and it is continuously dark. In mid January the first faint wash of twilight briefly touches the horizon (for just minutes per day), and then twilight increases in duration with increasing brightness each day until sunrise at end of February, then on 6 April the sun remains above the horizon until mid October.\\r\\nEcologically speaking, a season is a period of the year in which only certain types of floral and animal events happen (e.g.: flowers bloomspring; hedgehogs hibernatewinter). So, if we can observe a change in daily floral/animal events, the season is changing. In this sense, ecological seasons are defined in absolute terms, unlike calendar-based methods in which the seasons are relative. If specific conditions associated with a particular ecological season don't normally occur in a particular region, then that area cannot be said to experience that season on a regular basis.\\r\\nSix seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar-based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons.[18] Mild oceanic regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than continental climates, while the prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near to the sea. For example, prevernal crocus blooms typically appear as early as February in mild coastal areas of British Columbia, the British Isles, and western and southern Europe. The actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next. Average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere:\\r\\nIn the tropics, where seasonal dates also vary, it is more common to speak of the rainy (or wet, or monsoon) season versus the dry season. For example, in Nicaragua the dry season (November to April) is called 'summer' and the rainy season (May to October) is called 'winter', even though it is located in the northern hemisphere. In some tropical areas a three-way division into hot, rainy, and cool season is used. There is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight at different times of the year. However, many regions (such as the northern Indian ocean) are subject to monsoon rain and wind cycles.\\r\\nFloral and animal activity variation near the equator depends more on wet/dry cycles than seasonal temperature variations, with different species flowering (or emerging from cocoons) at specific times before, during, or after the monsoon season. Thus, the tropics are characterized by numerous \\"mini-seasons\\" within the larger seasonal blocks of time.\\r\\nIn the tropical parts of Australia in the northern parts of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, wet and dry seasons are observed in addition to or in place of temperate season names.[19]\\r\\nIndigenous people in polar, temperate and tropical climates of northern Eurasia, the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Australia have traditionally defined the seasons ecologically by observing the activity of the plants, animals and weather around them. Each separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according to local criteria that can vary from the hibernation of polar bears on the arctic tundras to the growing seasons of plants in the tropical rainforests. In Australia, some tribes have up to eight seasons in a year,[10] as do the Sami people in Scandinavia. Many indigenous people who no longer live directly off the land in traditional often nomadic styles, now observe modern methods of seasonal reckoning according to what is customary in their particular country or region.\\r\\nAs noted, a variety of dates are used in different countries to mark the changes of seasons, especially those that are calendar based. These observances are often declared \\"official\\" within their respective jurisdictions by the local or national media, even when the weather or climate is contradictory.[20] However they are mainly a matter of custom only, and have not generally been proclaimed by governments north or south of the equator for civil purposes.[21][22] The Met Office in the UK uses a three-month definition, e.g. declaring \\"spring\\" to be March, April, and May.[23] At least one researcher writing in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society compared various definitions to actual temperature changes, and recommended this three-month definition for general use in the United States.[24]","input":"What is the second season of the year?"},{"output":"2, 1889","context":"The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dakota Territory consisted of the northernmost part of the land acquired in the Louisiana purchase in 1803, as well as the southmost part of Rupert's Land, which was acquired in 1818 when the boundary was changed to the 49th parallel. The name refers to the Dakota branch of the Sioux tribes which occupied the area at the time. Most of Dakota Territory was formerly part of the Minnesota and Nebraska territories.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen Minnesota became a state in 1858, the leftover area between the Missouri River and Minnesota's western boundary fell unorganized. When the Yankton Treaty was signed later that year, ceding much of what had been Sioux Indian land to the U.S. Government, early settlers formed an unofficial provisional government and unsuccessfully lobbied for United States territory status.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree years later President-elect Abraham Lincoln's cousin-in-law, J.B.S. Todd, personally lobbied for territory status and the U.S. Congress formally created Dakota Territory. It became an organized territory on March 2, 1861. Upon creation, Dakota Territory included much of present-day Montana and Wyoming as well as all of present-day North Dakota and South Dakota and a small portion of present-day Nebraska.[citation needed]\\r\\nA small patch of land known as \\"Lost Dakota\\" existed as a remote exclave of Dakota Territory until it became part of Gallatin County, Montana Territory, in 1873.[1]\\r\\nDakota Territory was not directly involved in the American Civil War but did raise some troops to defend the settlements following the Dakota War of 1862 which triggered hostilities with the Sioux tribes of Dakota Territory. The Department of the Northwest sent expeditions into Dakota Territory in 1863, 1864 and 1865. It also established forts in Dakota Territory to protect the frontier settlements of the Territory, Iowa and Minnesota and the traffic along the Missouri River.\\r\\nFollowing the Civil War, hostilities continued with the Sioux until the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. By 1868, creation of new territories reduced Dakota Territory to the present boundaries of the Dakotas. Territorial counties were defined in 1872, including Bottineau County, Cass County and others.\\r\\nDuring the existence of the organized territory, the population first increased very slowly and then very rapidly with the \\"Dakota Boom\\" from 1870 to 1880.[2] Because the Sioux were considered very hostile and a threat to early settlers, the white population grew slowly. Gradually, the settlers' population grew and the Sioux were not considered as severe a threat.[3]\\r\\nThe population increase can largely be attributed to the growth of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Settlers who came to the Dakota Territory were from other western territories as well as many from northern and western Europe. These included large numbers of Norwegians, Germans, Swedes, and Canadians.[4]\\r\\nCommerce was originally organized around the fur trade. Furs were carried by steamboat along the rivers to the settlements. Gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874 and attracted more settlers, setting off the last Sioux War. The population surge increased the demand for meat spurring expanded cattle ranching on the territory's vast open ranges. With the advent of the railroad agriculture intensified: wheat became the territory's main cash crop. Economic hardship hit the territory in the 1880s due to lower wheat prices and a drought.[5]\\r\\nThe territorial capital was Yankton from 1861 until 1883, when it was moved to Bismarck. The Dakota Territory was divided into the states of North Dakota and South Dakota on November 2, 1889. The admission of two states, as opposed to one, was done for a number of reasons. The two population centers in the territory were in the northeast and southeast corners of the territory, several hundred miles away from each other. On a national level, there was pressure from the Republican Party to admit two states to add to their political power in the Senate.[6]:100ÿ101\\r\\n Admission of new western states was a party political battleground with each party looking at how the proposed new states were likely to vote. At the beginning of 1888, the Democrats under president Grover Cleveland proposed that the four territories of Montana, New Mexico, Dakota and Washington should be admitted together. The first two were expected to vote Democratic and the latter two were expected to vote Republican so this was seen as a compromise acceptable to both parties. However, the Republicans won majorities in Congress and the Senate later that year. To head off the possibility that Congress might only admit Republican territories to statehood, the Democrats agreed to a less favorable deal in which Dakota was divided in two and New Mexico was left out altogether. Cleveland signed it into law on February 22, 1889 and the territories could become states in nine months time after that. However, incoming Republican president Benjamin Harrison had a problem with South Dakota; most of the territory was Sioux reservation land and the state would not be viable unless much of this land became available to settlers.[6]:100ÿ102\\r\\nThere had been previous attempts to open up the territory, but these had foundered because the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) required that 75% of Sioux adult males on the reservation had to agree to any treaty change. Most recently, a commission headed by Richard Henry Pratt in 1888 had completely failed to get the necessary signatures in the face of opposition from Sioux leaders and even government worker Elaine Goodale, later Superintendent of Indian Education for the Dakotas. The government believed that the Dawes Act (1887), which attempted to move the Indians from hunting to farming, in theory meant that they needed less land (but in reality was an economic disaster for them) and that at least half was available for sale. Congress approved an offer of $1.25 per acre for reservation land (a figure they had previously rejected as outrageously high) and $25,000 to induce the Indians to sign.[6]:pp. 97ÿ99, 102\\r\\nA new commission was appointed in April 1889 that included veteran Indian fighter general George Crook. Crook pulled out all the stops to get the Indians to sign, using a number of underhand tactics. He threatened them that if they did not sign, the land would be taken anyway and they would get nothing. This would not have been seen as an idle threat; the treaty had been ignored in the past when the Black Hills were taken from the Sioux. Crook ignored leaders like Sitting Bull and Red Cloud who opposed the sale and kept them out of the negotiations, preferring instead to deal with moderate leaders like American Horse. American Horse, however, claimed immediately afterwards that he had been tricked into signing. Crook made many personal promises (such as on reservation rations) which he had no authority to make, or ability to keep. He claimed afterwards that he had only agreed to report the concerns back to Washington. Crook lied about how many signatures he already had, giving the impression that the signature he was currently asking for would make no difference. He said that those who did not sign would not get a share of the money for the land. Crook even allowed white men who had married Sioux to sign, a dubious action given that the blood quantum laws only counted full-blood Indians as members of the tribe. By August 6, 1889, Crook had the requisite number of signatures, half the reservation land was sold, and the remainder divided among six smaller reservations.[6]:pp. 102ÿ105\\r\\nNorth Dakota and South Dakota became states simultaneously on November 2, 1889.

The region has been a seasonal home to the rich and famous since first being brought to public attention by Ernest Hemingway in the late 1930s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first destination winter resort in the U.S. was developed by W. Averell Harriman, the chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, primarily to increase ridership on U.P. passenger trains in the West. The success of the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, spurred an increase in participation in winter sports (and alpine skiing in particular). A lifelong skier, Harriman determined that America would embrace a destination mountain resort, similar to those he enjoyed in the Swiss Alps, such as St. Moritz and Davos. During the winter of 1935ÿ36, Harriman enlisted the services of an Austrian count, Felix Schaffgotsch, to travel across the western U.S. to locate an ideal site for a winter resort. The Count toured Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Yosemite, the San Bernardino Mountains, Zion, Rocky Mountain National Park, the Wasatch Mountains, Pocatello, Jackson Hole, and Grand Targhee areas. Late in his trip and on the verge of abandoning his search for an ideal location for a mountain resort development, he backtracked toward the Ketchum area in central Idaho. A U.P. employee in Boise had casually mentioned that the rail spur to Ketchum cost the company more money for snow removal than any other branch line and the Count went to explore.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchaffgotsch was impressed by the combination of Bald Mountain and its surrounding mountains, adequate snowfall, abundant sunshine, moderate elevation, and absence of wind, and selected it as the site. Harriman visited several weeks later and agreed. The 3,888-acre (15.73?km2) Brass Ranch was purchased for about $4 per acre and construction commenced that spring; it was built in seven months for $1.5 million. Publicist Steve Hannagan named the resort \\"Sun Valley\\" and developed the tag line: Winter sports under a summer sun.[5]\\" (Count Schaffgotsch returned to Austria and was killed on the Eastern Front during World War II.) The centerpiece of the new resort was the Sun Valley Lodge, which opened on 21 December 1936.[6] The 220-room, X-shaped lodge's exterior was constructed of concrete, poured inside rough-sawn forms. The wood grain was impressed on the concrete finish, which was acid-stained brown to imitate wood. The Swiss-style Sun Valley Inn (originally the \\"Challenger Inn\\") and village were also part of the initial resort, opening in 1937. Hannagan wanted swimming pools at the resort, \\"so people won't think skiing is too cold.\\" Both the Lodge and the Inn have heated outdoor swimming pools, circular in shape. Hannagan had the pools designed this way, unique at the time, in the hope they would be widely photographed, providing free publicity, and it worked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first chairlifts were installed on the resort's Proctor and Dollar Mountains in the fall of 1936. (Proctor Mountain is northeast of Dollar Mountain). The U.P. chairlift design was adapted by an engineer recalling banana loading conveyor equipment used for tropical fruit ships' cargo. Single-seat chairlifts were developed at the U.P. headquarters in Omaha in the summer of 1936. The chairlift went on to replace primitive rope tow and other adaptations seen at ski areas at the time.[7] The original Proctor Mountain Ski Lift is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthor Ernest Hemingway completed For Whom the Bell Tolls, while staying in suite 206 of the Lodge in the fall of 1939. Averell Harriman had invited Hemingway and other celebrities, primarily from Hollywood, to the resort to help promote it.[9] Gary Cooper was a frequent visitor and hunting/fishing partner, as were Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, and several members of the Kennedy family. Hemingway was a part-time resident over the next twenty years, eventually relocating to Ketchum (\\"Papa\\" and his fourth wife are buried in the Ketchum Cemetery). The Hemingway Memorial, dedicated in 1966, is just off Trail Creek Road, about a mile northeast of the Sun Valley Lodge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSun Valley was featured (and promoted) in the 1941 movie Sun Valley Serenade, starring Sonja Henie, John Payne, Milton Berle, and bandleader Glenn Miller. Scenes were shot at the resort in March 1941. Sun Valley transfer local and future gold medalist Gretchen Fraser was the skiing stand-in for Henie.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1958, the cast of \\"I Love Lucy\\" filmed an episode of their follow-up series of hour-long specials, known in syndication as \\"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\\", at Bald Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971, Apollo 15 astronaut Jim Irwin, when stepping upon the surface of the Moon's HadleyÿApennine, the avid skier exclaimed that it was like Sun Valley.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSun Valley's oldest resident was former actress and silent movie star Barbara Kent. Another resident was actress Ann Sothern,[9] whose career spanned six decades and included 64 movies and 175 television episodes; she is buried in the Ketchum cemetery.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those associated with Sun Valley are Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Zuckerberg, Mats Wilander, Warren Buffett, Walter Annenberg, Adam West, Tom Hanks, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Miller, Demi Moore, Peter Cetera, Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, Ashton Kutcher, Richard Dreyfuss, Jamie Lee Curtis, Steve Wynn, Justin Timberlake, Mohamed al-Fayed, Barbara Kent, Bill Gates, Tony Robbins, and Gary Cooper.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the resort was closed in 1942 and converted to a convalescent hospital for the U.S. Navy (Pacific Theater), which was operational in July 1943.[13][14] It re-opened to the public in December 1946.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, the resort's clinic operated on the third floor of the northern wing of the Sun Valley Lodge (wing closest to the Trail Creek Rd.) until the Sun Valley Community Hospital was built in 1961. That facility was named after Dr. John Moritz when he retired in 1973; the Nebraska-born surgeon had served as the resort's year-round physician for 33 years. The Moritz Hospital was closed shortly after the new St. Luke's branch hospital opened (south of Ketchum) in November 2000 and the Moritz building now serves as employee housing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoted ski film producer Warren Miller, while in his early twenties, wintered in Sun Valley from 1946ÿ1949, first living in a car and small teardrop trailer in the River Run parking lot. Miller later rented an unheated garage for five dollars per month and sublet floor space to friends to pitch their sleeping bags (at fifty cents per night). One of these friends was Edward Scott, the future inventor of the lightweight aluminum ski pole. This extra cash helped Miller purchase his first rolls of 16?mm movie film, to start his motion picture career. During this time, he evolved from ski bum, to ski instructor, to ski filmmaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiller has traveled and filmed all over the world, but until recent years, he continued to return to Sun Valley virtually every year. He has featured Sun Valley in dozens of his annual films, which has helped publicize the Sun Valley region worldwide. His movies still play around the country today.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War II, Harriman focused on his career in government service and the Union Pacific gradually lost interest in the resort. Rail service was discontinued to Ketchum in 1964 and that November the resort was sold to the Janss Investment Company, a major Southern California real estate developer[16] headed by a former Olympic ski team member, Bill Janss (1918ÿ96),[17] founder of Snowmass. (Janss was an alternate on the 1940 team, but the games were cancelled due to the war). The railroad's management had called in the Janss Corporation as consultants[16] and it was determined that it would take a lot of work and no less than $6 million for a face-lifting. The Union Pacific decided to sell and brothers Ed and Bill Janss bid just under $3 million.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this Janss era of ownership, the north-facing Warm Springs area was developed, as well as Seattle Ridge, and condominium and home construction increased significantly. Seven chairlifts were added, and the number of trails increased from 33 to 62. The first two double chairs on Warm Springs were installed in series in 1965;[19] the upper \\"Limelight\\" had a 2,200-foot (670?m) vertical rise, the greatest in the U.S. at the time for a chairlift.[20] Bill Janss bought out his brother's share of the resort and gained full control of Sun Valley in 1968. Snowmaking was introduced on a limited basis in the fall of 1975, covering 40 acres (16?ha) up to an elevation of 8,200 feet (2,500?m)[21] The original Seattle Ridge double chairlift was installed in 1976, but due to a very poor snow year in 1976ÿ77 it was not operated until December 20, 1977, christened by local legend Gretchen Fraser. Janss also has a ski run named after him, called \\"Janss Pass,\\" to the skier's left of the Frenchman's chairlift. Janss' wife Ann, age 54, died in 1973 while helicopter skiing near Sun Valley.[22][23] Later that year, Janss married Mrs. Glenn Cooper, a widow, family friend, and mother of five, including World Cup racer Christin Cooper, silver medalist in the women's giant slalom at the 1984 Winter Olympics.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Janss' ownership, the Elkhorn area southeast of Dollar Mountain was developed by the Sun Valley Company and Johns-Manville, beginning in 1972.[25][26][27][28] During excavation, ancient tools dating back nearly 7,000 years were discovered.[29] Elkhorn's golf course was opened in the summer of 1975.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nJanss was running low on funds in 1977 and had entered into negotiations to sell the resort to the Walt Disney Company. While the negotiations were strung out by Disney, Earl Holding, a Utah businessman, learned of the situation through a small article in The Wall Street Journal and contacted Janss and arranged for a meeting. For about $12 million, Holding purchased Sun Valley through his company, Sinclair Oil, which operates the Grand America Hotels & Resorts.[18] Holding was initially distrusted by many locals: \\"Earl is a Four Letter Word\\" was a popular bumper sticker in the late 1970s in Blaine County. But time proved that Holding did not buy the resort for property speculation; like his other assets he meant to operate and improve for the long-term. One of his first changes was the removal the archaic single-seat chairlift on Exhibition, replacing it with a triple.[18] A daily lift ticket for Baldy during Holding's first season (1977ÿ78) was priced at $13.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Holding's ownership there have been substantial improvements on the mountain: extensive snowmaking and grooming, high-capacity chairlifts, and the construction of four impressive day lodges, a gondola, and the renovation of the classic Roundhouse restaurant.\\r\\nThe resort's golf course was redesigned in the late 1970s by Robert Trent Jones Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, the Warm Springs side boasted 100 acres (0.40?km2) of snowmaking up to an elevation of 8,200 feet (2,500?m), thought to be the highest anywhere at the time.[18] During the late 1980s and early 1990s, snowmaking was significantly expanded on Bald Mountain. Three high-speed quad chairlifts were installed during the summer of 1988 (Christmas, Challenger, & Greyhawk).[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn impressive day lodge, constructed of logs, river rock, and glass, opened at the base of Warm Springs in the fall of 1992, replacing the 1960s \\"Northface Hut\\" cafeteria.[34] Similar day lodges were later opened at the Seattle Ridge summit (1993), and the River Run base (1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn older cafeteria, the modest one-floor \\"Lookout Restaurant,\\" is 120 feet (37?m) below the summit at 9,030 feet (2,752?m), at the top of three chairlifts. Built in 1973, it is the ground floor of a multi-story building that was never completed, resulting in its \\"basement-like\\" atmosphere. Nevertheless, the mountain views from this near-summit lodge are quite impressive. However, the resort's recently[when?] approved master plan has the facility slated for eventual replacement.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour additional high-speed quads were installed in the 1990s. Two of these replaced older chairlifts on River Run (1992) and Seattle Ridge (1993), and two cut brand new paths: Lookout Express (1993) and Frenchman's (1994). The chairlift from River Run was purchased by Eldora Mountain Resort in Colorado.[35] Baldy's 13 chairlifts have a capacity of over 23,000 skiers per hour. With an average of 3,500 skiers per day (& less than 6,000 skiers per day during peak periods), Sun Valley has kept the lift lines to a minimum, a rarity among major resorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dollar Mountain Lodge opened in November 2004. This day lodge replaces the Dollar Cabin, and also serves as the headquarters for the Sun Valley Ski School. It is similar in construction to the newer day lodges at the big mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interior of the original Sun Valley Lodge has been remodeled twice during Holding's ownership, in 1985 for the golden anniversary and again in 2004. The Sun Valley Inn was also remodeled recently.[when?]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun Valley Golf Course saw significant improvement in the summer of 2008, with the opening of the new \\"White Cloud Nine\\" course on the site of the old Gun Club (relocated further down along Trail Creek road), as well as the opening of the \\"Sun Valley Club\\", a full service golf course club house built in the style of the resort's mountain day lodges, replacing a much smaller and older facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year also saw the opening of the \\"Sun Valley Pavilion,\\" built in partnership with the Sun Valley Summer Symphony as a permanent home for the orchestra's annual three-and-a-half-week series of free concerts. The Pavilion is a performing arts facility that has hosted several well-known musical artists and more slated to perform in the near future.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the resort installed the \\"Roundhouse Express Gondola\\" on Bald mountain, which runs from the mountain's River Run Base to the Roundhouse Restaurant (located midway up the mountain, at 7,700 feet (2,350?m). The Exhibition triple chairlift, originally as a single chair in 1939, was removed with the addition of the new 8-passenger lift. The new gondola carries both skiers and non-skiers to the restaurant for lunch and eventually dinner year-round. The Roundhouse Restaurant was built 79 years ago in 1939 and was finished being remodeled to accommodate its new year round role in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarl Holding died in April 2013 and his family continued to run the resort. In 2006, Forbes magazine estimated that Sun Valley was worth in the range of $300 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years before the World Cup circuit, the Harriman Cup at Sun Valley was one of the major ski races held in North America, along with the \\"Snow Cup\\" at Alta, the \\"Roch Cup\\" at Aspen Mountain, and the \\"Silver Belt\\" races at Sugar Bowl, north of Lake Tahoe. Originally known as the \\"Sun Valley International Open,\\" the Harriman Cup races were the first major international ski competitions held in North America, beginning in 1937. The first three competitions of 1937ÿ39 were held in the Boulder Mountains north of Sun Valley. Beginning in 1940, the Harriman Cup was held on the Warm Springs side of Bald Mountain, decades before chairlifts were installed on that north face of the mountain. American Dick Durrance won three of the first four Harriman Cups, stunning the overconfident Europeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the final season before the launch of the World Cup, Sun Valley hosted the world's top racers in 1966 at the \\"American International\\" in late March, with a full slate of races for both men and women. With the 1966 World Championships not run until August, it was one of the biggest alpine racing events since the 1964 Olympics. The Austrians swept the men's downhill (Heini Messner, Karl Schranz, and Egon Zimmermann), while Jean-Claude Killy of France won the slalom, with Schranz as runner-up.[36] The two switched places in the one-run giant slalom.[37] Erika Schinegger of Austria, Nancy Greene of Canada, and Marielle Goitschel of France were the top three in the women's downhill,[38] while Goitschel and teammate Annie Famose finished 1-2 in the slalom.[36] Goitschel, Greene, and Famose were the top finishers in the giant slalom and France took the overall team title.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1975 and 1977, Sun Valley hosted World Cup ski races, with slalom and giant slalom events for both men and women,[40] run on the Warm Springs side of the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1975 slalom was won by Gustavo Thoeni, the dominant World Cup skier of the early 1970s (which turned out to be his last win in the slalom discipline).[41] A young Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, perhaps the greatest technical ski racer ever, took the giant slalom title both years. Thoeni and Stenmark left Idaho tied in the overall standings in 1975,[41] which Thoeni won in the finals of a parallel slalom the next week in Italy. Phil Mahre of White Pass, Washington, age 19, won the 1977 slalom race over Stenmark, with twin brother Steve placing third.[42] It was Phil's second win (he had won a GS in France in December), but his first victory in the slalom and first in the U.S., and being from the Northwest, very close to home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present ownership has declined to host any World Cup races since, as it involves closing off runs for a significant time. But during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake (about 300 miles (480?km) to the southeast), Sun Valley was used as a training site for many nations' alpine and Nordic ski teams. The alpine speed events for the Olympics were held at a sister resort, Snowbasin, outside of Ogden, Utah.\\r\\n\\r\\nSun Valley is scheduled to host the U.S. Alpine Championships in 2016 and 2018, held after the World Cup season in March. It last hosted the event in 1951.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlympic medalists from Sun Valley include Gretchen Fraser, Christin Cooper, Picabo Street, snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington, and disabled skier Muffy Davis, a founding and honorary board member of Sun Valley Adaptive Sports. All five have runs named after them on Bald Mountain: three are on Seattle Ridge (Gretchen's Gold, Christin's Silver (ex-Silver Fox) and Muffy's Medals (ex-Southern Comfort)), Picabo's Street (ex-Plaza) on Warm Springs, and Kaitlyn's Bowl (ex-Farout Bowl) on the Bowls. US TV's legendary sports commentator Tim Ryan (CBS/NBC) also lives in Sun Valley as well as Ski Racing Magazine's proud owner, Gary Black Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nSun Valley has a lively arts community offering a variety of opportunities through over thirty presenting organizations. Local, regional and nationally known artists are represented through gallery exhibitions, concerts, theater productions, dance productions, film festivals, lectures, opera and symphonic performances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"At an elevation of 5,945 feet (1,812?m), the air in Sun Valley is rarefied- and so is the clientele of the area's top-flight art galleries. Serving the valley's plethora of well-heeled and well-educated art collections are art galleries that could hold their own in Manhattan, Berlin, London or Los Angeles.\\" ÿ Art Ltd Magazine\\r\\n\\r\\nThe non-profit Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities was initiated in 1969 by Mrs. Glenn Cooper and Bill Janss, who later married.[24] It attained non-profit status and was officially founded in 1971; the original 5-acre (20,000?m2) campus was located off Dollar Road in Sun Valley. Studios and workshops were open to the public and focused on Ceramics, founded by James Romberg; Photography, founded by Sheri Heiser and Peter deLory; and Fine Arts, founded by David W. Wharton. The SVC offered year-round workshops, lectures, and exhibitions by nationally recognized artists and craft persons to both residents and tourists to Blaine County.\\r\\nToday the Sun Valley Center for the Arts has its main building in nearby Ketchum as well as a historic house and classroom in Hailey, and continues to present an impressive list of guest artists in the visual and performing arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, FOCUS Mountain Media, a publishing group based in Sun Valley, launched a quarterly magazine about mountain culture with a specific view towards life in Sun Valley.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun Valley region boasts a wide variety of year-round adaptive sports programs for the disabled including the local DSUSA Chapter - Higher Ground Sun Valley; Wood River Ability Program; Sage Brush Equine Training Center for the Handicapped and Camp Rainbow Gold, a youth cancer program.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small mountain saddle splits the city of Sun Valley into two sections. The northern section is centered around the famous Sun Valley Lodge, Inn, and the \\"village\\" complex of shops, condominiums, and original 18-hole golf course (27 holes by 2008), which winds its way up the Trail Creek valley to the northeast. This area is referred to as simply \\"Sun Valley.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southern area of Elkhorn, adjacent to Dollar Mountain, has its own condo complex and 18-hole golf course. Quite distinct and separate, including a drier \\"sagebrush\\" appearance, it was initially developed in 1972.[25][26] The Sun Valley Company took over day-to-day operations of the Elkhorn Golf Club in July 2011 and named Rick Hickman director of golf operations for the company.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjacent to Sun Valley is the older city of Ketchum, which is just a mile downstream of the Sun Valley Lodge (along Trail Creek). Ketchum comprises primarily the 19th-century town center (with its limited grid system) and lands adjacent to Bald Mountain along the Big Wood River and Warm Springs Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun Valley/Ketchum CVB offers area wide information on events, vacation planning information and area resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 11, 2005, the Dalai Lama visited Wood River High School in Hailey to give a speech on understanding and friendship in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 Attacks and offered condolences to the many thousands affected by the recent Hurricane Katrina.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nSun Valley is located at 434050N 1142034W? / ?43.68056N 114.34278W? / 43.68056; -114.34278 (43.680491, ?114.342711),[48] at an elevation of 5,945 feet (1,812?m) above sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.89 square miles (25.61?km2), of which, 9.88 square miles (25.59?km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03?km2) is water.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nSun Valley's climate is a mixture of humid continental, semi-arid and subarctic climates, that leans towards the continental variety.

It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being Little Boy, and its detonation marked the third-ever man-made nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium from the Hanford Site and dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar. For the Fat Man mission, Bockscar was piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney.\\r\\nThe name Fat Man refers generically to the early design of the bomb, because it had a wide, round shape. It was also known as the Mark III. Fat Man was an implosion-type nuclear weapon with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget, in the Trinity nuclear test, less than a month earlier on 16 July at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico.\\r\\nTwo more Fat Man bombs were detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. Some 120 Fat Man units were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research, Robert Oppenheimer held conferences in Chicago in June and Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. A gun-type design was chosen, in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by firing a \\"bullet\\" into a \\"target\\".[1] Richard C. Tolman suggested an implosion-type nuclear weapon, but the idea attracted scant consideration.[2]\\r\\nThe feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. James Conant heard on 14 November from Wallace Akers, the director of the British \\"Tube Alloys\\" project, that James Chadwick had \\"concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities.\\"[3] Conant consulted Ernest Lawrence and Arthur Compton, who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem, but could offer no ready solution. Conant informed the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer, and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity.[4]\\r\\nOppenheimer, reviewing his options in early 1943, gave priority to the gun-type weapon,[2] but as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.[5]\\r\\nThe gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed \\"Thin Man\\" and \\"Fat Man\\" respectively. These code names were created by Robert Serber, a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man would be a very long device, and the name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel The Thin Man and series of movies by the same name; the Fat Man would be round and fat and was named after Sydney Greenstreet's character in The Maltese Falcon. Little Boy would come last, as a variation of Thin Man.[6] The use of the term \\"little boy\\" for the uranium-235 gun-type device is not known to have had any connection to George L. Harrison's use of the same term on the morning of July 18, 1945, in his report to President Harry Truman, while he attended the Potsdam Conference, concerning the success of the Trinity test two days earlier.[7]\\r\\nNeddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman's initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by Hugh Bradner, Charles Critchfield, and John Streib. L. T. E. Thompson was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and Edwin McMillan to visit the National Defense Research Committee's Explosives Research Laboratory near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb), where they spoke to George Kistiakowsky and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was the only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.[8]\\r\\nOppenheimer brought John von Neumann to Los Alamos in September 1943 to take a fresh look at implosion. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density.[9] The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the Earth's core with George Gamow.[10] The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.[9]\\r\\nThe implosion project remained a backup until April 1944, when experiments by Emilio G. Segr and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the B Reactor at the Hanford site showed that it contained impurities in the form of the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass.[11] The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.[12]\\r\\nThe impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research focused on the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.[12] The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional explosive lenses came from James L. Tuck, and was developed by von Neumann.[13] To overcome the difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations, Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston invented exploding-bridgewire detonators to replace the less precise primacord detonation system.[13] Robert Christy is credited with doing the calculations that showed how a solid subcritical sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state, greatly simplifying the task, since earlier efforts had attempted the more-difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell.[14] After Christy's report, the solid-plutonium core weapon was referred to as the \\"Christy Gadget\\".[15]\\r\\nThe task of the metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium.[16] The brittle ϫ phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic  phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable Ѵ phase that normally exists in the 300ÿ450?C (570ÿ840?F) range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutoniumÿgallium alloy, which stabilized the Ѵ phase and could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.[17]\\r\\nThe size of the bomb was constrained by the available aircraft. The only Allied aircraft capable of carrying the Fat Man were the British Avro Lancaster and the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress. For logistic and nationalistic reasons, the B-29 was preferred, but this constrained the bomb to a maximum length of 11 feet (3.4?m), width of 5 feet (1.5?m) and weight of 20,000 pounds (9,100?kg). Removing the bomb rails allowed a maximum width of 5.5 feet (1.7?m).[18] Drop tests began in March 1944, and resulted in modifications to the Silverplate aircraft due to the weight of the bomb.[19] High-speed photographs revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a \\"California Parachute\\", a cubical open-rear tail box outer surface with eight radial fins inside of it, four angled at 45 and four perpendicular to the line of fall holding the outer square-fin box to the bomb's rear end, was approved.[20] In drop tests in early weeks, the Fat Man missed its target by an average of 1,857 feet (566?m), but this was halved by June as the bombardiers became more proficient with it.[21]\\r\\nThe early Y-1222 model Fat Man was assembled with some 1,500 bolts.[22][23] This was superseded by the Y-1291 design in December 1944. This redesign work was substantial, and only the Y-1222 tail design was retained.[23] Later versions included the Y-1560, which had 72 detonators; the Y-1561, which had 32; and the Y-1562, which had 132. There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no detonators at all.[24] The final wartime Y-1561 design was assembled with just 90 bolts.[22]\\r\\nBecause of its complicated firing mechanism and the need for previously untested synchronization of explosives and precision design, it was thought that a full test of the concept was needed before the scientists and military representatives could be confident it would perform correctly under combat conditions. On 16 July 1945, a Y-1561 model Fat Man, known as the Gadget for security reasons, was detonated in a test explosion at a remote site in New Mexico, known as the \\"Trinity\\" test. It gave a yield of about 20 kilotonnes (84?TJ).[25] Some minor changes were made to the design as a result of the Trinity test.[26] Philip Morrison recalled that \\"There were some changes of importance... The fundamental thing was, of course, very much the same.\\"[27]\\r\\nThe bomb was 128 inches (3,300?mm) long and 60 inches (1,500?mm) in diameter. It weighed 10,300 pounds (4,700?kg).[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo allow insertion of the 3.62-inch (92?mm) diameter plutonium pit,[22] containing the 0.8-inch (20?mm) diameter \\"Urchin\\" modulated neutron initiator, as late as possible in the device's assembly, the spherical 8.75-inch (222?mm) diameter depleted uranium tamper surrounded by a 0.125-inch (3.2?mm) thick shell of boron impregnated plastic had a 5-inch (130?mm) diameter cylindrical hole running through it, like the hole in a cored apple. The missing tamper cylinder, containing the pit, could be slipped in through a hole in the surrounding 18.5-inch (470?mm) diameter aluminium pusher.[29] The pit was warm to touch, emitting 2.4 W/kg-Pu, about 15 W for the 6.19 kilograms (13.6?lb) core.[30]\\r\\nThe explosion symmetrically compressed the plutonium to twice its normal density before the \\"Urchin\\" added free neutrons to initiate a fission chain reaction.[31]\\r\\nThe result was the fission of about 1 kilogram (2.2?lb) of the 6.19 kilograms (13.6?lb) of plutonium in the pit, i.e. of about 16% of the fissile material present. 1 gram (0.035?oz) of matter in the bomb is converted into the active energy of heat and radiation, releasing the energy equivalent to the detonation of 21 kilotons of TNT or 88 terajoules.[37]\\r\\nThe first plutonium core, along with its polonium-beryllium Urchin initiator, was transported in the custody of Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium-field carrying-case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper.[31] The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 26 July, and arrived at North Field on Tinian on 28 July. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s; two, Luke the Spook and Laggin' Dragon, from the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on 2 August. Upon arrival, F31 was partly disassembled in order to check all its components. F33 was expended near Tinian during a final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.[38]\\r\\nIn August 1945, the Fat Man was assembled on Tinian by Project Alberta personnel. When the physics package was fully assembled and wired, it was placed inside its ellipsoidal aerodynamic bombshell and wheeled out, where it was signed by nearly 60 people, including Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell and Captain William S. Parsons.[39] It was then wheeled to the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar after its normally assigned command pilot, Captain Frederick C. Bock,[40] who flew The Great Artiste with his crew on the mission. Bockscar was flown by Major Charles W. Sweeney and his crew, with Commander Frederick L. Ashworth from Project Alberta as the weaponeer in charge of the bomb.[41]\\r\\nBockscar lifted off at 03:47 on the morning of 9 August 1945, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The weapon was already armed, but with the green electrical safety plugs still engaged. Ashworth changed them to red after ten minutes so that Sweeney could climb to 17,000 feet (5,200?m) in order to get above storm clouds.[42] During pre-flight inspection of Bockscar, the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use 640 US gallons (2,400?l) of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. 509th Composite Group Commander Colonel Paul Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.[43]\\r\\nThe original target for the bomb was the city of Kokura, but it was found to be obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.[44]\\r\\nSweeney then proceeded to the alternative target, Nagasaki. It too was obscured by cloud, and Ashworth ordered Sweeney to make a radar approach. At the last minute, the bombardier,[42] Captain Kermit K. Beahan,[41] found a hole in the clouds. The Fat Man was dropped and, following a 43-second duration free fall, it exploded at 11:02 local time, at an altitude of about 1,650 feet (500?m).[42] Because of poor visibility due to cloud cover, the bomb missed its intended detonation point by almost two miles, and damage was somewhat less extensive than that in Hiroshima.\\r\\nAn estimated 35,000ÿ40,000 people were killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000ÿ80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims.[45] Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation.[46] Most of the direct deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or industrial workers.[47] Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would have required a year to get back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity would have required 15 months. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, the factory that manufactured the type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.[47][48]\\r\\nAfter the war, two Y-1561 Fat Man bombs were used in the Operation \\"Crossroads\\" nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. The first, known as Gilda after Rita Hayworth's character in the 1946 movie of the same name, was dropped by the B-29 Dave's Dream. The bomb missed its aim point by 710 yards (650?m). The second bomb, nicknamed Helen of Bikini, was placed, without its tail fin assembly, in a steel caisson made from a submarine's conning tower, and detonated 90 feet (27?m) beneath the landing craft LSM-60. The two weapons yielded about 23 kilotonnes (96?TJ) each.[49]\\r\\nThe Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces had already commenced work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, then on the drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not as wide as the Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design to make it easier to manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.[50]\\r\\nThe Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man was ordered to be put into production in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of Project Camel. A new plant was established at the Iowa Army Ordnance Plant. Mechanical components were made or procured by the Rock Island Arsenal. Electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions, known as Mods 1 and 2, which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2.[51] Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949,[52] when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb.[53] The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.[52][54]\\r\\nDue to the limitations of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would first have to fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.[55]\\r\\nAs much of the Manhattan Project data leaked by the spies Klaus Fuchs, Theodore Hall, and David Greenglass to the Soviet Union concerned Fat Man, the Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon, designated \\"Joe 1\\" by the United States, was based closely on Fat Man's design. It was detonated on 29 August 1949 as part of Operation \\"First Lightning\\".[56][57]","input":"What were the names of the atomic bombs?"},{"output":"March 5, 1980","context":"Channel Islands National Park is a United States national park that consists of five of the eight Channel Islands off the coast of the U.S. state of California, in the Pacific Ocean. Although the islands are close to the shore of densely populated Southern California, their isolation has left them relatively undeveloped. The park covers 249,561 acres (100,994?ha) of which 79,019 acres (31,978?ha) are owned by the federal government.[1] The Nature Conservancy owns and manages 76% of Santa Cruz Island, the largest island in the park.[4]\\r\\nChannel Islands National Park is home to a wide variety of significant natural and cultural resources. It was designated a U.S. National Monument on April 26, 1938, and a National Biosphere Reserve in 1976. It was promoted to a National Park on March 5, 1980.[5][6] Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary encompasses the waters six nautical miles around Channel Islands National Park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Channel Islands were originally discovered in 1542 by the explorer Juan Rodrguez Cabrillo.[7][8] In 1938 the Santa Barbara and Anacapa islands were designated a national monument. San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands were combined with the monument in 1980 to form modern-day Channel Islands National Park.[7]\\r\\nOn January 28, 1969 an oil rig belonging to Union Oil experienced a blow-out 6 miles (9.7?km) off the coast of California.[9] The resulting spill was, at the time, the largest oil spill to occur in United States territorial waters. Crews took approximately 11 days to seal the rupture using a cement plug, during which approximately 200,000 US gallons (760,000 litres; 170,000 imperial gallons) of crude oil spilled into the Pacific Ocean, creating an oil slick with an area of about 800 square miles (2,100?km2).[7][10] Following the spill, tides carried the oil onto the beaches of the Anacapa, San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands.[10]\\r\\nThis spill had a large impact on native wildlife of the Channel Islands. Much of the islands' seabird population was affected, with over an estimated 3,600 avians killed. Meanwhile, seals, dolphins and other sea life died and washed ashore on both the islands and the mainland.[10][11]\\r\\nThis spill is the third largest oil spill in the United States, only surpassed by the Deepwater Horizon and the Exxon Valdez oil spills.[9] It resulted in a 34,000 acres (14,000?ha) expansion of the Department of the Interior buffer zone in the channel and contributed to the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency.[12]\\r\\nThe islands within the park extend along the Southern California coast from Point Conception near Santa Barbara to San Pedro, a neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The spotted skunk and Channel Islands fox also are endemic. The island fence lizard[14] is also endemic to the Channel Islands.[15] Other animals in the park include island scrub jay, harbor seal, California sea lion, island fox, spotted skunk, island night lizard, barn owl, American kestrel, horned lark and meadowlark and California brown pelican. One hundred and forty-five of these species are unique to the islands and found nowhere else in the world. Marine life ranges from microscopic plankton to the endangered blue whale, the largest animal on earth. Archeological and cultural resources span a period of more than 10,000 years.\\r\\nThe average annual visitation to the park's mainland visitor center was around 300,000 in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 364,807 visiting in 2016.[3] The visitor center is located in the Ventura Harbor Village. The visitor center contains several exhibits that provide information regarding all five islands, native vegetation, marine life and cultural history. Also, visitors can enjoy a short film, free of charge, that provides an overview of all five islands. The visitor center is open every day, except Thanksgiving and Christmas, from 8:30AMÿ5:00PM.[16] Visitation to the islands and waters is low, with about 30,000 visitors traveling to the islands, and another 60,000 who go only into park waters. Although most visitation occurs in the summer, migrating gray whales and spectacular wildflower displays attract visitors in the winter and spring. Autumn is an excellent time to travel to the park, as well as for diving, as the days are usually sunny, with minimal winds and clear ocean water. Camping is a popular activity on Santa Cruz Island, with visitors arriving at Prisoners Harbor [17] on the north shore and staying in the valley beyond. A new island visitor center opened at Scorpion Ranch on Santa Cruz Island on April 6, 2009.[18]\\r\\nChannel Islands National Park offers a wide variety of recreation activities, kayaking through the sea caves being one of the most popular. Backpacking, camping, day hiking, scuba diving, and spearfishing are among the activities available to visitors. Channel Islands National Park is renowned for its large number of complex, beautiful sea caves. Based on ocean conditions and ferry availability, Scorpion Anchorage on Santa Cruz Island is the most visited area in the park for day and camping visitors. It is recommended that inexperienced visitors use caution when visiting the national park due to changing ocean conditions in this unique ecosystem.

The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India.[3]\\r\\nThe company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600, making it the oldest among several similarly formed European East India Companies. Wealthy merchants and aristocrats owned the company's shares.[4] Initially the government owned no shares and had only indirect control.\\r\\nDuring its first century of operation, the focus of the company was trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the French East India Company (Compagnie fran?aise des Indes orientales) during the Carnatic Wars of the 1740s and 1750s. The Battle of Plassey and Battle of Buxar, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Indian powers, left the company in control of Bengal and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the extent of the territories under its control, ruling the whole Indian subcontinent either directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force by its Presidency armies, much of which were composed of native Indian sepoys.\\r\\nBy 1803, at the height of its rule in India, the British East India company had a private army of about 260,000twice the size of the British Army.[5] The company eventually came to rule large areas of India with its private armies, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions.[6] Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 and lasted until 1858, when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown's assuming direct control of the Indian subcontinent in the form of the new British Raj.\\r\\nDespite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems with its finances. It was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act passed one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of British India had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.\\r\\nSoon after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, London merchants presented a petition to Queen Elizabeth I for permission to sail to the Indian Ocean.[7] Permission was granted, and on 10 April 1591 three ships sailed from Torbay around the Cape of Good Hope to the Arabian Sea on one of the earliest English overseas Indian expeditions. One of them, Edward Bonaventure, then sailed around Cape Comorin to the Malay Peninsula and returned to England in 1594.[7]\\r\\nIn 1596, three more ships sailed east but were all lost at sea.[7] Three years later, on 22 September 1599,[8] another group of merchants met and stated their intention \\"to venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies (the which it may please the Lord to prosper), and the sums that they will adventure\\", committing S30,133.[9] Two days later, on 24 September, \\"the Adventurers\\" reconvened and resolved to apply to the Queen for support of the project.[9] Although their first attempt had not been completely successful, they nonetheless sought the Queen's unofficial approval to continue, bought ships for their venture and increased their capital to S68,373.\\r\\nThe Adventurers convened again a year later.[7] This time they succeeded, and on 31 December 1600, the Queen granted a Royal Charter to \\"George, Earl of Cumberland, and 215 Knights, Aldermen, and Burgesses\\" under the name, Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies.[10] For a period of fifteen years the charter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly on trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan.[10] Any traders in breach of the charter without a licence from the company were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo (half of which went to the Crown and the other half to the company), as well as imprisonment at the \\"royal pleasure\\".[11]\\r\\nThe governance of the company was in the hands of one governor and 24 directors or \\"committees\\", who made up the Court of Directors. They, in turn, reported to the Court of Proprietors, which appointed them. Ten committees reported to the Court of Directors. According to tradition, business was initially transacted at the Nags Head Inn, opposite St Botolph's church in Bishopsgate, before moving to India House in Leadenhall Street.[12]\\r\\nSir James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601[13] and returned in 1603.[14] In March 1604 Sir Henry Middleton commanded the second voyage. General William Keeling, a captain during the second voyage, led the third voyage aboard the Red Dragon from 1607 to 1610 along with the Hector under Captain William Hawkins and the Consent under Captain David Middleton.[15]\\r\\nEarly in 1608 Alexander Sharpeigh was appointed captain of the company's Ascension, and general or commander of the fourth voyage. Thereafter two ships, Ascension and Union (captained by Richard Rowles) sailed from Woolwich on 14 March 1607ÿ08.[15]\\r\\nInitially, the company struggled in the spice trade because of the competition from the already well-established Dutch East India Company. The company opened a factory in Bantam on the first voyage, and imports of pepper from Java were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at Surat, which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\\r\\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\\r\\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the Battle of Swally in 1612, at Suvali in Surat. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the Mughal Empire, and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.[16]\\r\\nIn 1612, James I instructed Sir Thomas Roe to visit the Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim Jahangir (r.?1605ÿ1627) to arrange for a commercial treaty that would give the company exclusive rights to reside and establish factories in Surat and other areas. In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:[16]\\r\\nUpon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure. For confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.\\r\\nEventually, the East India Company seized control of Bengal and slowly the whole Indian subcontinent with its private armies, composed primarily of Indian sepoys. As historian William Dalrymple observes,\\r\\nWe still talk about the British conquering India, but that phrase disguises a more sinister reality. It was not the British government that seized India at the end of the 18th century, but a dangerously unregulated private company headquartered in one small office, five windows wide, in London, and managed in India by an unstable sociopath ÿ [Robert] Clive.[5]\\r\\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese Estado da ndia, which had established bases in Goa, Chittagong, and Bombay, which Portugal later ceded to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza. The East India Company also launched a joint attack with the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) on Portuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China, which helped secure EIC ports in China.[17] The company established trading posts in Surat (1619), Madras (1639), Bombay (1668), and Calcutta (1690). By 1647, the company had 23 factories, each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor, and 90 employees[clarification needed] in India. The major factories became the walled forts of Fort William in Bengal, Fort St George in Madras, and Bombay Castle.\\r\\nIn 1634, the Mughal emperor extended his hospitality to the English traders to the region of Bengal, and in 1717 completely waived customs duties for their trade. The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, indigo dye, saltpetre, and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the Straits of Malacca by ousting the Portuguese in 1640ÿ41. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th and 18th centuries.\\r\\nIn 1657, Oliver Cromwell renewed the charter of 1609, and brought about minor changes in the holding of the company. The restoration of monarchy in England further enhanced the EIC's status.\\r\\nIn an act aimed at strengthening the power of the EIC, King Charles II granted the EIC (in a series of five acts around 1670) the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops and form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas.[18]\\r\\nWilliam Hedges was sent in 1682 to Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal, to obtain a firman, an imperial directive that would grant England regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal Empire. However, the company's governor in London, Sir Josiah Child, interfered with Hedges's mission, causing Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb to break off the negotiations.\\r\\nIn 1689 a Mughal fleet commanded by Sidi Yaqub attacked Bombay. After a year of resistance the EIC surrendered in 1690, and the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb's camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future. The emperor withdrew his troops and the company subsequently re-established itself in Bombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.[19]\\r\\nThe company eventually came to rule large areas of the Indian subcontinent with its private armies, primarily composed of Indian sepoys, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions.\\r\\nIn 1613, during the rule of Tokugawa Hidetada of the Tokugawa shogunate, the British ship Clove, under the command of Captain John Saris, was the first British ship to call on Japan. Saris was the chief factor of the EIC's trading post in Java, and with the assistance of William Adams, a British sailor who had arrived in Japan in 1600, was able to gain permission from the ruler to establish a commercial house in Hirado on the Japanese island of Kyushu:\\r\\nWe give free license to the subjects of the King of Great Britaine, Sir Thomas Smythe, Governor and Company of the East Indian Merchants and Adventurers forever safely come into any of our ports of our Empire of Japan with their shippes and merchandise, without any hindrance to them or their goods, and to abide, buy, sell and barter according to their own manner with all nations, to tarry here as long as they think good, and to depart at their pleasure.[20]\\r\\nHowever, unable to obtain Japanese raw silk for import to China and with their trading area reduced to Hirado and Nagasaki from 1616 onwards, in 1623 the company closed their factory.[21]\\r\\nIn September 1695, Captain Henry Every, an English pirate on board the Fancy, reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet making the annual voyage to Mocha. The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden Ganj-i-Sawai, reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean, and its escort, the Fateh Muhammed. They were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat. The pirates gave chase and caught up with Fateh Muhammed some days later, and meeting little resistance, took some S50,000 to S60,000 worth of treasure.[22]\\r\\nEvery continued in pursuit and managed to overhaul Ganj-i-Sawai, which resisted strongly before eventually striking. Ganj-i-Sawai carried enormous wealth and, according to contemporary East India Company sources, was carrying a relative of the Grand Mughal, though there is no evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue. The loot from the Ganj-i-Sawai had a total value between S325,000 and S600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces, and has become known as the richest ship ever taken by pirates.\\r\\nIn a letter sent to the Privy Council by Sir John Gayer, then governor of Bombay and head of the East India Company, Gayer claims that \\"it is certain the Pirates ... did do very barbarously by the People of the Ganj-i-Sawai and Abdul Ghaffar's ship, to make them confess where their money was.\\" The pirates set free the survivors who were left aboard their emptied ships, to continue their voyage back to India.\\r\\nWhen the news arrived in England it caused an outcry. In response, a combined bounty of S1,000 was offered for Every's capture by the Privy Council and East India Company, leading to the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history. The plunder of Aurangzeb's treasure ship had serious consequences for the English East India Company. The furious Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Sidi Yaqub and Nawab Daud Khan to attack and close four of the company's factories in India and imprison their officers, who were almost lynched by a mob of angry Mughals, blaming them for their countryman's depredations, and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India. To appease Emperor Aurangzeb and particularly his Grand Vizier Asad Khan, Parliament exempted Every from all of the Acts of Grace (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates.[23]\\r\\nAn 18th-century depiction of Henry Every, with the Fancy shown engaging its prey in the background\\r\\nBritish pirates that fought during the Child's War engaging the Ganj-i-Sawai\\r\\nDepiction of Captain Every's encounter with the Mughal Emperor's granddaughter after his September 1695 capture of the Mughal trader Ganj-i-Sawai\\r\\nThe prosperity that the officers of the company enjoyed allowed them to return to Britain and establish sprawling estates and businesses, and to obtain political power. The company developed a lobby in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed Interlopers by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.[24]\\r\\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. By an act that was passed in 1698, a new \\"parallel\\" East India Company (officially titled the English Company Trading to the East Indies) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of S2?million. The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of S315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.[24]\\r\\nIt quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced scarcely any measurable competition. The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state. Under this arrangement, the merged company lent to the Treasury a sum of S3,200,000, in return for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the situation was to be reviewed. The amalgamated company became the United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies.[24]\\r\\nIn the following decades there was a constant battle between the company lobby and the Parliament. The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\\r\\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of S1?million. Between 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years' War diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and defence of its territorial possessions in Europe and its colonies in North America.[25]\\r\\nThe war took place on Indian soil, between the company troops and the French forces. In 1757, the Law Officers of the Crown delivered the Pratt-Yorke opinion distinguishing overseas territories acquired by right of conquest from those acquired by private treaty. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.[25]\\r\\nWith the advent of the Industrial Revolution, Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market. William Henry Pyne notes in his book The Microcosm of London (1808) that:\\r\\nOn the?1 March 1801, the debts of the East India Company to S5,393,989 their effects to S15,404,736 and their sales increased since February 1793, from S4,988,300 to S7,602,041.\\r\\nSir John Banks, a businessman from Kent who negotiated an agreement between the king and the company, began his career in a syndicate arranging contracts for victualling the navy, an interest he kept up for most of his life. He knew that Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn had amassed a substantial fortune from the Levant and Indian trades.\\r\\nHe became a Director and later, as Governor of the East India Company in 1672, he arranged a contract which included a loan of S20,000 and S30,000 worth of saltpetrealso known as potassium nitrate, a primary ingredient in gunpowderfor the King \\"at the price it shall sell by the candle\\"that is by auctionwhere bidding could continue as long as an inch-long candle remained alight.[26]\\r\\nOutstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre. Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at S37,000 between the king and the company. So urgent was the need to supply the armed forces in the United Kingdom, America and elsewhere that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales. One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt.[27]\\r\\nThe Seven Years' War (1756ÿ63) resulted in the defeat of the French forces, limited French imperial ambitions, and stunted the influence of the Industrial Revolution in French territories. Robert Clive, the Governor General, led the company to a victory against Joseph Fran?ois Dupleix, the commander of the French forces in India, and recaptured Fort St George from the French. The company took this respite to seize Manila in 1762.[28][better?source?needed]\\r\\nBy the Treaty of Paris, France regained the five establishments captured by the British during the war (Pondichry, Mahe, Karikal, Yanam and Chandernagar) but was prevented from erecting fortifications and keeping troops in Bengal (art. XI). Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondichry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\\r\\nIn its first century and half, the EIC used a few hundred soldiers as guards. The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely Indian troops, and trained them along European lines.[29] The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed to become a private corporate armed force, and was used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion, rather than its original purpose as a guard force, and became the most powerful military force in the Indian sub-continent. As it increased in size the army was broken into the Presidency Armies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay each recruiting their own integral infantry, cavalry, artillery and horse artillery units. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its fleet and although made up predominantly of heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, it also included warships.\\r\\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private well-disciplined and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the Carnatic region from its base at Madras and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.[30]\\r\\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against Siraj Ud Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, Bihar, and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally.\\r\\nWith the gradual weakening of the Marathas in the aftermath of the three Anglo-Maratha wars, the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of Ahmmadnagar, province of Cuttack (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of Odisha, Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, Balasore Port, parts of Midnapore district of West Bengal), Bombay (Mumbai) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\\r\\nHyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, the rulers of the Kingdom of Mysore, offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\\r\\nThe last vestiges of local administration were restricted to the northern regions of Delhi, Oudh, Rajputana, and Punjab, where the company's presence was ever increasing amidst infighting and offers of protection among the remaining princes. The hundred years from the Battle of Plassey in 1757 to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 were a period of consolidation for the company, during which it seized control of the entire Indian subcontinent and functioned more as an administrator and less as a trading concern.\\r\\nA cholera pandemic began in Bengal, then spread across India by 1820. 10,000 British troops and countless Indians died during this pandemic.[32] Between 1760 and 1834 only some 10% of the East India Company's officers survived to take the final voyage home.[33]\\r\\nIn the early 19th century the Indian question of geopolitical dominance and empire holding remained with the East India Company.[34] The three independent armies of the company's Presidencies, with some locally raised irregular forces, expanded to a total of 280,000 men by 1857.[35] First recruited from mercenaries and low-caste volunteers, the Bengal Army especially eventually became composed largely of high-caste Hindus and landowning Muslims.\\r\\nWithin the Army, British officers who initially trained at the company's own academy at the Addiscombe Military Seminary, always outranked Indians, no matter how long their service. The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Rissaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior subaltern equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\\r\\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of Runion and Mauritius.\\r\\nThere was a systemic disrespect in the company for the spreading of Protestantism although it fostered respect for Hindu and Muslim, castes and ethnic groups. The growth of tensions between the EIC and the local religious and cultural groups grew in the 19th century as the Protestant revival grew in Great Britain. These tensions erupted at the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the company ceased to exist when the company dissolved through the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873.[36]\\r\\nIn the 18th century, Britain had a huge trade deficit with Qing dynasty China and so, in 1773, the company created a British monopoly on opium buying in Bengal, India by prohibiting the licensing of opium farmers and private cultivation. The monopoly system established in 1799 continued with minimal changes until 1947.[37] As the opium trade was illegal in China, Company ships could not carry opium to China. So the opium produced in Bengal was sold in Calcutta on condition that it be sent to China.[38]\\r\\nDespite the Chinese ban on opium imports, reaffirmed in 1799 by the Jiaqing Emperor, the drug was smuggled into China from Bengal by traffickers and agency houses such as Jardine, Matheson & Co and Dent & Co. in amounts averaging 900 tons a year. The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at Lintin Island were paid into the company's factory at Canton and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\\r\\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the Straits Settlements in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\\r\\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, to curb smuggling. This resulted in the First Opium War (1839ÿ42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.[37] The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share.[39] A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India's reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.[37]\\r\\nThe company employed many junior clerks, known as \\"writers\\", to record the details of accounting, managerial decisions, and activities related to the company, such as minutes of meetings, copies of Company orders and contracts, and filings of reports and copies of ship's logs. Several well-known British scholars and literary men had Company writerships, such as Henry Thomas Colebrooke in India and Charles Lamb in England.\\r\\nThough the company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was becoming clearer that the company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. The Bengal famine of 1770, in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\\r\\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the Tea Act in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\\r\\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the Townshend Acts, setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the Boston Tea Party in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, one of the major events leading up to the American Revolution.\\r\\nBy the Regulating Act of 1773 (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the Parliament of Great Britain imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \\"acquisition of sovereignty by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\\".\\r\\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at S40,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the Government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by Warren Hastings, the incumbent Governor, who became the first Governor-General of Bengal, with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.[40] His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a Council of Four appointed by the Crown. Initially, the Council consisted of Lt. General Sir John Clavering, The Honourable Sir George Monson, Sir Richard Barwell, and Sir Philip Francis.[41]\\r\\nHastings was entrusted with the power of peace and war. British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The Governor General and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.[41]\\r\\nThe East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) had two key aspects:\\r\\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. Edmund Burke, a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\\r\\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of Earl Cornwallis that the powers of the Governor-General be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief to be jointly held by the same official.\\r\\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, Burma, Malaya, Singapore, and British Hong Kong, and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, Penang, one of the states in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.[42]\\r\\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20 years by the Charter Act of 1793. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities.\\r\\nThe aggressive policies of Lord Wellesley and the Marquess of Hastings led to the company's gaining control of all India (except for the Punjab and Sindh), and some part of the then kingdom of Nepal under the Sugauli Treaty. The Indian Princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the Charter Act of 1813 which, among other things:\\r\\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of laissez-faire economic ideology form the background to the Government of India Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\\r\\nBritish influence continued to expand; in 1845, Great Britain purchased the Danish colony of Tranquebar. The company had at various stages extended its influence to China, the Philippines, and Java. It had solved its critical lack of cash needed to buy tea by exporting Indian-grown opium to China. China's efforts to end the trade led to the First Opium War (1839ÿ1842).\\r\\nThe English Education Act by the Council of India in 1835 reallocated funds from the East India Company to spend on education and literature in India.\\r\\nThis Act (16 & 17 Vict. c. 95) provided that British India would remain under the administration of the company in trust for the Crown until Parliament should decide otherwise. It also introduced a system of open competition as the basis of recruitment for civil servants of the company and thus deprived the Directors of their patronage system.[45]\\r\\nUnder the act, for the first time the legislative and executive powers of the governor general's council were separated. It also added six additional members to the governor general's executive committee.[46]\\r\\nThe Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the Indian Mutiny) resulted in widespread devastation in India: many condemned the East India Company for permitting the events to occur.[47] In the aftermath of the Rebellion, under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858, the British Government nationalised the company. The Crown took over its Indian possessions, its administrative powers and machinery, and its armed forces.\\r\\nThe company remained in existence in vestigial form, continuing to manage the tea trade on behalf of the British Government (and the supply of Saint Helena) until the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 came into effect, on 1 January 1874. This Act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock.[48] The Times commented on 8 April 1873:[49]\\r\\nIt accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other trading Company ever attempted, and such as none, surely, is likely to attempt in the years to come.\\r\\nThe company's headquarters in London, from which much of India was governed, was East India House in Leadenhall Street. After occupying premises in Philpot Lane from 1600 to 1621; in Crosby House, Bishopsgate, from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726ÿ9; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796ÿ1800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861ÿ62. The site is now occupied by the Lloyd's building.\\r\\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the River Thames at Deptford. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at Blackwall: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\\r\\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the East India Docks) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the West India Dock Company. The docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909, and closed in 1967.\\r\\nThe East India College was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \\"writers\\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in Hertford Castle, but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a public school, now Haileybury and Imperial Service College.\\r\\nThe East India Company Military Seminary was founded in 1809 at Addiscombe, near Croydon, Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\\r\\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, Hackney, London, a private lunatic asylum run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the Royal India Asylum, at Hanwell, Middlesex.[50]\\r\\nThe East India Club in London was formed in 1849 for officers of the company. The Club still exists today as a private gentlemen's club with its club house situated at 16 St. James's Square, London.[51]\\r\\nThe East India Company had a long lasting impact on the Indian Subcontinent, with both positive and harmful effects. Although dissolved following the rebellion of 1857, it stimulated the growth of the British Empire. Its armies were to become the armies of British India after 1857, and it played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India.\\r\\nThe East India Company was the first company to record the Chinese usage of orange-flavoured tea, which led to the development of Earl Grey tea.[52]\\r\\nThe East India Company introduced a system of merit-based appointments that provided a model for the British and Indian civil service.[53]\\r\\nWidespread corruption and looting of Bengal resources and treasures during its rule resulted in poverty.[5] Famines, such as the Great Bengal famine of 1770 and subsequent famines during the 18th and 19th centuries, became more widespread, chiefly because of exploitative agriculture promulgated by the policies of the East India company and the forced cultivation of opium in place of grain.[54][55]\\r\\nMacaulayism and the British education system have been blamed for producing a generation of Indians not proud of their distinct heritage.[56]\\r\\nDownman (1685)\\r\\nLens (1700)\\r\\nNational Geographic (1917)\\r\\nRees (1820)\\r\\nLaurie (1842)\\r\\n1600ÿ1707\\r\\n1707ÿ1801\\r\\n1801ÿ1874\\r\\nThe English East India Company flag changed with history, with a canton based on the current flag of the Kingdom, and a field of 9 to 13 alternating red and white stripes.\\r\\nFrom the period of 1600, the canton consisted of a St George's Cross representing the Kingdom of England. With the Acts of Union 1707, the canton was updated to be the new Union Flagconsisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish St Andrew's crossrepresenting the Kingdom of Great Britain. After the Acts of Union 1800 that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom, the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a Saint Patrick's Saltire replicating the updated Union Flag representing the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\\r\\nRegarding the field of the flag, there has been much debate and discussion regarding the number and order of the stripes. Historical documents and paintings show many variations from 9 to 13 stripes, with some images showing the top stripe's being red and others showing the top stripe being white.\\r\\nAt the time of the American Revolution the East India Company flag was nearly identical to the Grand Union Flag. Historian Charles Fawcett argued that the East India Company Flag inspired the Stars and Stripes.[57]\\r\\nThe East India Company's original coat of arms was granted in 1600. The arms was as follows:\\r\\n\\"Azure, three ships with three masts, rigged and under full sail, the sails, pennants and ensigns Argent, each charged with a cross Gules; on a chief of the second a pale quarterly Azure and Gules, on the 1st and 4th a fleur-de-lis or, on the 2nd and 3rd a leopard or, between two roses Gules seeded Or barbed Vert.\\" The shield had as a crest: \\"A sphere without a frame, bounded with the Zodiac in bend Or, between two pennants flottant Argent, each charged with a cross Gules, over the sphere the words DEUS INDICAT\\" (Latin: God Indicates). The supporters were two sea lions (lions with fishes' tails) and the motto was DEO DUCENTE NIL NOCET (Latin: Where God Leads, Nothing Harms).[58]\\r\\nThe East India Company's arms, granted in 1698, were: \\"Argent a cross Gules; in the dexter chief quarter an escutcheon of the arms of France and England quarterly, the shield ornamentally and regally crowned Or.\\" The crest was: \\"A lion rampant guardant Or holding between the forepaws a regal crown proper.\\" The supporters were: \\"Two lions rampant guardant Or, each supporting a banner erect Argent, charged with a cross Gules.\\" The motto was AUSPICIO REGIS ET SENATUS ANGLI? (Latin: Under the auspices of the King and the Senate of England).[58]\\r\\nHEIC Merchant's mark on East India Company Coin: 1791 Half Pice\\r\\nHEIC Merchant's mark on a Blue Scinde Dawk postage stamp (1852)\\r\\nWhen the East India Company was chartered in 1600, it was still customary for individual merchants or members of Companies such as the Company of Merchant Adventurers to have a distinguishing merchant's mark which often included the mystical \\"Sign of Four\\" and served as a trademark. The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a \\"Sign of Four\\" atop a heart within which was a saltire between the lower arms of which were the initials \\"EIC\\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage[59] and forms the central emblem displayed on the Scinde Dawk postage stamps.[60]\\r\\nShips of the East India Company were called East Indiamen or simply \\"Indiamen\\".[61]\\r\\nDuring the period of the Napoleonic Wars, the East India Company arranged for letters of marque for its vessels such as the Lord Nelson. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the Earl of Mornington, an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\\r\\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the Bombay Marine, equipped with warships such as Grappler. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the Invasion of Java.\\r\\nAt the Battle of Pulo Aura, which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, Nathaniel Dance, Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the Warley, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the Woodford, under Captain Charles Lennox, the Taunton-Castle, Captain Edward Studd, Canton, Captain Abel Vyvyan, Boddam, Captain George Palmer, and ((ship|Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral de Sercey and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the General Goddard played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off St Helena.\\r\\nEast India Company (EIC)'s ships were well built, with the result that the Royal Navy bought several Company ships to convert to warships and transports. The Earl of Mornington became HMS Drake.

Frau is in origin the equivalent of \\"Mylady\\" or \\"Madam\\", a form of address of a noblewoman. But by an ongoing process of devaluation of honorifics, it came to be used as the unmarked term for \\"woman\\" by about 1800. Therefore, Fr?ulein came to be interpreted as expressing a \\"diminutive of woman\\", as it were implying that a Fr?ulein is not-quite-a-woman. By the 1960s, this came to be seen as patronising by proponents of feminism, and during the 1970s and 1980s, the term Fr?ulein became nearly taboo in urban and official settings, while it remained an unmarked standard in many rural areas. This process was somewhat problematic, at least during the 1970s to 1980s, since many unmarried women of the older generation insisted on Fr?ulein as a term of distinction, respecting their status, and took the address of Frau as offensive or suggestive of extra-marital sexual experience.\\r\\nSince the 1970s, Fr?ulein has come to be used less often, and was banned from official use in West Germany in 1972 by the Minister of the Interior.[2] Nowadays, style guides and dictionaries recommend that all women be addressed as Frau regardless of marital status, particularly in formal situations.[3][4] A newsletter published on the website of the German dictionary Duden in 2002, for instance, noted that women should only be addressed as Fr?ulein when they specifically request this form of address.[5]\\r\\nDespite its less common everyday use nowadays, Fr?ulein has seen a revival in recent years as a vogue term, especially in popular culture.

The winner was determined by the show's viewers via telephone, the Internet, and SMS text voting, and was awarded a recording contract with Cowell's record label Syco Music, worth $5 million in seasons one and two, and $1 million in season three. America voted for the following winners: Melanie Amaro, Tate Stevens, and Alex & Sierra, respectively.\\r\\nThe show began airing on September 21, 2011,[3] and aired annually from September through December until 2013. The series employed a panel of judges who critiqued the contestants' performances. Each contestant was assigned to one of four categories. The group acts were one category and the others were based on age or gender. For example, in season 1 the categories were girls, boys, groups, and over 30s. Each judge was assigned to one of the categories,[4] and acted as mentor to the contestants in his or her category, helping to decide song choices, styling, and staging, while also judging contestants from the other categories after each of the live performances. They competed with each other to try to get one of the contestants in their category to win the competition, thus making them the winning judge. The most successful contestants to have emerged from the series are Fifth Harmony and Camila Cabello, namely.[5]\\r\\nThe original judging panel consisted of Cowell, Paula Abdul, Cheryl Cole and L.A. Reid, with Nicole Scherzinger and Steve Jones as co-hosts. Scherzinger later replaced Cole on the panel after two audition sites. Demi Lovato and Britney Spears joined the panel in the second season as replacements for Abdul and Scherzinger, while Khlo Kardashian and Mario Lopez replaced Jones as co-hosts. Spears and Reid did not return for the third season and were replaced by Kelly Rowland and Paulina Rubio, while Lopez became sole host after Kardashian was not asked to come back.\\r\\nOn February 7, 2014, Fox announced that The X Factor would not be renewed for a fourth season, following Cowell's decision to return to the UK version of the series a day earlier.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon Cowell was previously a critically acclaimed judge on the enormously successful reality show American Idol, which was the number one show in the United States for eight consecutive seasons. Cowell was also a judge on the original UK version of the show, called Pop Idol, which did not fare so well but he did help the creator sell the franchise to the United States.\\r\\nCowell wished to create and launch a new show that he would own the rights to. In 2004, Pop Idol was axed, and ITV announced a new show in the United Kingdom, The X Factor in which the winner receives a $5 million recording contract with his record label; the show had produced highly flourished multi-platinum artists, such as series three winner Leona Lewis and the group One Direction, respectively.\\r\\nIn April 2009, it was reported that Cowell was planning to try to launch a version of The X Factor in the U.S. after his American Idol contract ended at the close of its season nine.[7] (As long as Cowell's American Idol contract was still in force, it had prohibited him from launching a competing show such as The X Factor in the U.S.)[7] In September, Fox, the broadcaster of American Idol, signed the deal to launch the U.S. version of The X Factor.\\r\\nHowever, prior to selling The X Factor franchise to the United States, American Idol creator Simon Fuller sued Cowell, claiming that he should be credited as an executive producer despite having no involvement with Cowell's new show (Fuller also sued Cowell in the U.K. after Pop Idol was cancelled due to the success of The X Factor, alleging it somehow infringed his Pop Idol series). After the lawsuit in 2011 in the U.S., Cowell was allowed to bring The X Factor to the United States but could not be credited with the titles \\"creator\\" or \\"executive producer\\".\\r\\nOn January 11, 2010, News Corporation (via Fox News in the U.S. and The Times in the UK) reported that Cowell would leave American Idol after season nine in order to bring The X Factor to the U.S. in September 2011. Cowell told the Television Critics Association that he was leaving American Idol so that he could judge and act as executive producer of the U.S. version of The X Factor.[8] Additionally, Cowell signed a long-term contract with Sony Music, who already supported Syco Music artists in the UK, under which he was involved with the production of the U.S. version of the show and also worked with the artists who won recording contracts.[2]\\r\\nIn November 2010, Fox began airing short commercials for the program, which displayed the text \\"Coming to America Fall 2011\\".[9][10] The New York Times described the commercials as efforts by the network to set up the launch of The X Factor as a television \\"event.\\"[9] In February 2011, during Super Bowl XLV, Fox unveiled the official logo for the show in a promo starring Cowell.[11] A second promo was shown during the course of that evening, featuring Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Lady Gaga, the Pussycat Dolls and Madonna. This promo gave rise to speculation about who would join Cowell on the X Factor judging panel.[12]\\r\\nIn November 2014, it was reported that Cowell was considering re-launching the American version in 2015, though this was proved untrue.[13] However, Cowell has said he's more than willing to give the American version another go, and that they've actually received offers to bring it back on other networks, though he said he'll bring it back when there's less competition in the tv talent show landscape.\\r\\nThe show is primarily concerned with identifying singing talent, though appearance, personality, stage presence and dance routines are also an important element of many performances. Each judge is assigned one of four categories, to use their experience to help the artists. For season one, these categories were: \\"Boys\\" (aged 12ÿ29 males), \\"Girls\\" (aged 12ÿ29 females), \\"Over 30s\\" (solo acts aged 30 and over), and \\"Groups\\" (including duos). Season two's categories and age group boundaries were changed, with the \\"Boys\\" and \\"Girls\\" categories becoming \\"Teens\\" (solo acts aged 12ÿ17) and \\"Young Adults\\" (solo acts aged 18ÿ24), and the \\"Over 30s\\" became \\"Over 25s\\" (solo acts aged 25 and over). For both seasons, some groups were formed from soloists and other groups rejected after the audition process.[4] Through the live shows, the judges act as mentors to their category, helping to decide song choices, styling and staging, while judging contestants from other categories.\\r\\nThere are five stages to the competition:\\r\\nThere are four stages to the competition:\\r\\nThe show is open to solo artists and vocal groups aged 12 and above, with no upper age limit.[14][15] Applicants are given an opportunity to apply by uploading a video audition to the Internet. The show's producers also send a \\"mobile audition van\\" to various locations throughout the U.S. to audition singers who are unable to attend the arena auditions. A round of first auditions is held in front of producers months before the show is aired, some by application and appointment, and others in \\"open\\" auditions that anyone can attend. These auditions, held at various venues around the U.S., attract very large crowds. The producers' auditions are not televised, but shots of crowds waving and \\"judges' cars\\" arriving are filmed and later spliced in with the televised auditions shot later in the year. After waiting at the venue for hours (during which crews film more shots of crowds screaming and waving), each candidate is given a brief audition by someone from the production team. If they pass that audition (either because of their talent or because the producers think they will make entertaining television), they are given a \\"golden ticket\\" that allows them to audition for a more senior member of the production team. Only candidates who successfully pass this second audition (and then a third along similar lines) are invited to perform in front of the judges. (The televised version misleadingly gives the impression that everyone in the huge crowds shown is waiting for a chance to perform for the judges.)\\r\\nA selection of the auditions in front of the judges ÿ usually the best, the worst and the most bizarre ÿ are broadcast during the first few weeks of the show. The judges' auditions are held in front of a live audience, and the acts sing over a backing track. If a majority of the judges (in this case, at least three judges) have to say \\"yes\\" then the act goes through to the next stage, otherwise they are sent home.\\r\\nIn the first two seasons, The contestants selected at the auditions were further refined through a series of performances at \\"boot camp\\", and then at the \\"judges' houses\\", until a small number eventually progressed to the live finals (seventeen in season 1, and sixteen in season 2).\\r\\nAt boot camp, the judges collaboratively chose a small number of acts (32 in season 1 with eight in each category; 24 in season 2 with six in each category) for the next round, \\"judges' houses\\". The producers then assigned each of the judges a category to mentor, and the judges split up for the \\"judges' houses\\" round, in which each of them hosted the contestants in their assigned category at a luxurious residence, often scattered around the globe. The houses the contestants visited did not in every case actually belong to the judges, some were rented for the occasion.\\r\\nThe contestants did not know who their mentor would be until they arrived at that judge's house.\\r\\nDuring this round, each judge held another round of auditions on location, and then further reduced the number of acts with the help of a celebrity guest.\\r\\nIn season three, these stages of the competition are being replaced by a new stage called \\"The Six-Chair Challenge\\", first introduced in the Dutch version of the series.[16]\\r\\nThe selected finalists (either 16 or 17 acts) move into shared accommodation at the Hollywood Hills to take part in the show. The mansion is also notably used for housing the finalists from American Idol.[17]\\r\\nThe finals consist of a series of two live shows, the first featuring the contestants' performances and the second revealing the results of the public voting, culminating in one or more acts being eliminated. Celebrity guest performers also feature regularly. These live shows are filmed at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California. The performance shows are broadcast on Wednesday nights and the results show on Thursday nights. In season one, seventeen acts were put through to the live shows, and sixteen acts were put through in season two.\\r\\nIn addition to the live broadcast on Fox, Sony and SYCOtv created a completely integrated second-screen experience and a Pepsi sponsored live digital pre-show known as The X Factor Digital Experience. In addition to watching the program live on television, the audience was now able to participate on multiple platforms in real-time.[18][19]\\r\\nThe show is primarily concerned with identifying a potential pop star or star group, and singing talent, appearance, personality, stage presence and dance routines are all important elements of the contestants' performances. In the initial live shows, each act performs once in the first show in front of a studio audience and the judges, usually singing over a pre-recorded backing track. Dancers are also commonly featured. Acts occasionally accompany themselves on guitar or piano. Each live show has had a different theme; each contestant's song is chosen according to the theme. After each act has performed, the judges comment on their performance. Heated disagreements, usually involving judges defending their contestants against criticism, are a regular feature of the show. Once all the acts have appeared, the phone lines open and the viewing public vote on which act they want to keep. Once the number of contestants has been reduced to five (season 1), or six (season 2), each act would perform twice in the performances show. This continues until only three acts remain. These acts go on to appear in the grand final which decides the overall winner by public vote.\\r\\nBefore the results are announced, the results show occasionally begins with a group performance from the remaining contestants. However, the song is pre-recorded and the contestants mime, due to problems with the number of microphones. The two acts polling the fewest votes are revealed. Both these acts perform again in a \\"final showdown\\", and the judges vote on which of the two to send home. They were able to pick new songs to perform in the \\"final showdown\\". \\"Double elimination\\" took place in some of the results show, where the bottom three acts were revealed and the act with the fewest votes was automatically eliminated, and the two with the next fewest votes performed in the \\"final showdown\\" as normal. In season two, at the end of each results show, the rankings of the acts based on the public votes were announced.\\r\\nTies are possible as there are four judges voting on which of the two to send home. In the event of a tie the result goes to deadlock, and the act who came last in the public vote is sent home. The actual number of votes cast for each act is not revealed, nor even the order. However, a twist occurred in season two where the rankings of the acts based on the public vote for the week were revealed after the eliminations on the show. Once the number of contestants has been reduced to four, the act which polled the fewest votes is automatically eliminated from the competition (the judges do not have a vote; their only role is to comment on the performances).\\r\\nThe winner of the competition is awarded a recording contract with Syco Music in association with Sony Music Entertainment, which would include cash payments totaling $5 million.[14][15] A press release on behalf of the show on February 7, 2011 called the recording contract \\"the largest guaranteed prize in television history.\\"[20] Unlike the British version of the show,[21] the costs of recording and marketing the winning artist will be paid for separately from the $5?million initial contract payment. The $5 million will be paid directly to the winner in five annual installments of $1 million. Cowell said in a conference call with reporters on February 7, 2011: \\"I think it should be a life-changing prize and just to be clear, this isn't a dressed-up $5 million, this is a guaranteed $5 million payable to the winner. The recording, marketing, and video costs are completely separate to that. It will be paid over five years at $1 million a year.\\"[22] Cowell said in the same conference call that the specific music label within the Sony family that the winner signs with depends on which label could provide the best support to the winner with regard to the type of music the winner chooses to perform.\\r\\nTo date, three seasons have been broadcast, as summarized below.\\r\\n????

I'll probably go and find someone who did what I did for a living. I was an A&R guy for 20 years.\\"[24] Eventually, Grammy Award-winning record executive, songwriter, and record producer L.A. Reid,[25][26] former The X Factor judge Cheryl Cole,[27][28] and Cowell's former American Idol colleague Paula Abdul[29] were confirmed to join Cowell in the judging panel. Cole was dismissed from the show after two sets of auditions and was replaced by co-host Nicole Scherzinger from the Newark auditions.\\r\\nAfter season one, the show's producers had said that they would undergo some changes which resulted in, what media outlets called, an \\"X Factor Shake-up\\". On January 30, 2012, it was announced that neither Abdul nor Scherzinger would return as a judge for season two.[30] When searching for replacements, Cowell sought to hire pop star Britney Spears as Scherzinger's replacement. After months of negotiations, Cowell and Spears came to an agreement for season two. Following the employment of Spears, Cowell was looking for a young superstar, in order to bring in a younger audience. On May 14, it was confirmed that Demi Lovato and Spears were the new judges.\\r\\nOn December 13, 2012, Reid announced that he would not be returning as a judge for a third season, instead opting to focus on Epic Records. Spears announced on January 11, 2013 that she would not be renewing her contract for another season, opting to focus on recording her eighth studio album. In March 2013, Lovato was announced to be joining Cowell on the panel again for season three. In April 2013, it was reported that former X Factor UK judge Kelly Rowland was the front runner to replace Spears. In May, it was officially confirmed that Rowland and Paulina Rubio would join Cowell and Lovato for season three.[31]\\r\\nPaula Abdul (2011)\\r\\nSimon Cowell (2011ÿ13)\\r\\nL.A.

Reports on who were going to replace Jones as the host circulated for months. Reality star Khlo Kardashian and Extra host Mario Lopez were confirmed as the two hosts hired. The season two auditions, bootcamp, and judges' houses phases of the show went on without hosts as they were not yet confirmed.

It is described in ancient historical chronicles such as the Bamboo Annals, the Classic of History and the Records of the Grand Historian. According to tradition, the Xia dynasty was established by the legendary Yu the Great after Shun, the last of the Five Emperors gave his throne to him.[1] The Xia was later succeeded by the Shang dynasty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the traditional chronology based upon calculations by Liu Xin, the Xia ruled between 2205 and 1766 BC; according to the chronology based upon the Bamboo Annals, it ruled between 1989 and 1558 BC. The XiaÿShangÿZhou Chronology Project commissioned by the Chinese government in 1996, concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BC. The tradition of tracing Chinese political history from heroic early emperors to the Xia, and on to succeeding dynasties, comes from the idea of the Mandate of Heaven, in which only one legitimate ruler exists at a given time. This political philosophy was promoted by the Confucian school in the Eastern Zhou period, later becoming the official position of imperial historiography and ideology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Xia is an important element of early recorded Chinese history, reliable information on the history of China before 13th century BC can only come from archaeological evidence, as China's first established written system on a durable medium, the oracle bone script, did not exist until then.[2] No mention of the Xia, or the supposed conquest of the Xia by the Shang, has been found in any Shang period oracle bones. The first documentary reference to the Xia dates from more than a thousand years later, in the records of the Zhou dynasty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Xia dynasty was described in classic texts such as the Classic of History (Shujing), the Bamboo Annals, and the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by Sima Qian.  According to tradition, the Huaxia were the ancestral people of the Han Chinese.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional histories trace the development of the Xia to the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. According to ancient Chinese texts, before the Xia dynasty was established, battles were frequent between the Xia tribe and Chi You's tribe. The Xia tribe slowly developed around the time of Zhuanxu, one of the Five Emperors. The Records of the Grand Historian and the Classic of Rites say that Yu the Great is the grandson of Zhuanxu, but there are also other records, like Ban Gu, that say Yu is the fifth generation of Zhuanxu. Based on this, tradition ascribes the ancestry of the Xia clan to Zhuanxu.[5][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGun, the father of Yu the Great, is the earliest recorded member of the Xia clan. When the Yellow River flooded, many tribes united together to control and stop the flooding. Gun was appointed by Emperor Yao to stop the flooding. He ordered the construction of large blockades to block the path of the water. The attempt of Gun to stop the flooding lasted for nine years, but it was a failure because the floods became stronger. After nine years, Yao had already given his throne to Shun. Gun was ordered to be imprisoned for life to reform the Eastern Barbarians by Shun at Yushan (Chinese: ޗ\\\\), a mountain located between modern Donghai County in Jiangsu Province and Linshu County in Shandong Province.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nYu was highly trusted by Shun, so Shun appointed him to finish his father's work, which was to stop the flooding.  Yu's method was different from his father's: he organized people from different tribes and ordered them to help him build canals in all the major rivers that were flooding and lead the water out to the sea. Yu was dedicated to his work. People praised his perseverance and were inspired, so much so that other tribes joined in the work. Legend says that in the 13 years it took him to successfully complete the work to stop the floods, he never went back to his home village to stop and rest, even though he passed by his house three times.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nYu's success in stopping the flooding increased agricultural production (since the floods were destructive). The Xia tribe's power increased and Yu became the leader of the surrounding tribes. Soon afterwards Shun sent Yu to lead an army to suppress the Sanmiao tribe, which continuously abused the border tribes. After defeating them, he exiled them south to the Han River area. This victory strengthened the Xia tribe's power even more. As Shun aged, he thought of a successor and relinquished the throne to Yu, whom he deemed worthy. Yu's succession marks the start of the Xia dynasty. As Yu neared death he passed the throne to his son, Qi, instead of passing it to the most capable candidate, thus setting the precedent for dynastic rule or the Hereditary System. The Xia dynasty began a period of family or clan control.[citation needed] It is believed that Zhenxun (modern Gongyi) was one of the capitals of the dynasty.\\r\\n\\r\\nJie, the last king, was said to be corrupt. He was overthrown by Tang, the first king of the Shang dynasty.\\r\\nTang is said to have given the small state of Qi as a fief to the remnants of the Xia ruling family.[7][8]\\r\\nThis practice was referred to as \\"the two crownings and the three respects\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nZengzi was a descendant of the Xia dynasty Kings through Shao Kang.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kings of the State of Yue claimed descent from the Xia dynasty Kings through Shao Kang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paucity of written evidence and the time gap between the supposed time of the Xia and the first written references to it have meant that the historicity of the Xia dynasty itself and the traditional narrative of its history is at best uncertain. The Skeptical School of early Chinese history, started by Gu Jiegang in the 1920s, was the first group of scholars within China to systematically question the traditional story of its early history. By critically examining the development of the narrative of early Chinese history throughout history, Gu concluded \\"the later the time, the longer the legendary period of earlier history... early Chinese history is a tale told and retold for generations, during which new elements were added to the front end\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome historians have suggested that the Zhou rulers invented the Xia as a pretext, to justify their conquest of the Shang, by noting that just as the Shang had supplanted the Xia, they had supplanted the Shang. The existence of the Xia remains unproven, despite efforts by Chinese archaeologists to link them with the Bronze Age Erlitou culture.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other points, Gu and other historians note certain parallels between the traditional narrative of Xia history and Shang history that would suggest probable Zhou-era fabrication or at least embellishment of Xia history. Yun Kuen Lee's criticism of nationalist sentiment in developing an explanation of Three Dynasties chronology focuses on the dichotomy of evidence provided by archaeological versus historical research, in particular, the claim that the archaeological Erlitou Culture is also the historical Xia dynasty. \\"How to fuse the archaeological dates with historical dates is a challenge to all chronological studies of early civilization.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China, Sarah Allan noted that many aspects of the Xia are simply the opposite of traits held to be emblematic of the Shang dynasty.  The implied dualism between the Shang and Xia, Allan argues, is that while the Shang represents fire or the sun, birds and the east, the Xia represent the west and water.  The development of this mythical Xia, Allan argues, is a necessary act on the part of the Zhou dynasty, who justify their conquest of the Shang by noting that the Shang had supplanted the Xia. However, there are scholars also argue that Shang remnants still existed during early Zhou dynasty, Zhou rulers couldnt simply justify their succession to pacify Shang remnants if its entirely fabricated since they wouldn't believe it in the first place.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Shang oracle bone inscriptions contain no mention of the Xia, some scholars have suggested that polities they mention might be remnants of the Xia.\\r\\nGuo Moruo suggested that an enemy state called Tufang state mentioned in many inscriptions might be identified with the Xia.[14]\\r\\nThe historian Shen Changyun pointed to four inscriptions mentioning Qi, the same name as the Zhou-era state of Qi, which according to traditional accounts was established by the defeated royal house of Xia.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts. There exists a debate as to whether or not the Erlitou culture was the site of the Xia dynasty. Radiocarbon dating places the site at c. 2100 to 1800 BC, providing physical evidence of the existence of a state contemporaneous with and possibly equivalent to the Xia dynasty as described in Chinese historical works.[16]  In 1959, a site located in the city of Yanshi was excavated containing large palaces that some archaeologists have attributed to capital of the Xia dynasty.  Through the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs in the same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts regarding Xia;[17] at a minimum, the era traditionally denoted as the Xia dynasty marked an evolutionary stage between the late Neolithic cultures and the urban civilization of the Shang dynasty.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Chinese archaeologists uncovered the remains of an imperial sized palacedated to about 1700 BCat Erlitou in Henan, further fueling the discussions about the existence of the dynasty.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeological evidence of a large outburst flood that destroyed the Lajia site on the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been dated to about 1920 BC. This date is shortly before the rise of the Erlitou culture in the middle Yellow River valley and the Yueshi culture in Shandong, following the decline of the Longshan culture in the North China Plain. The authors suggest that this flood may have been the basis for the later myth, and contributed to the transition of cultures. They further argue that the timing is further evidence for the identification of the Xia with the Erlitou culture.[19]\\r\\nHowever, no evidence of contemporaneous widespread flooding in the North China Plain has yet been found.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table lists the rulers of Xia according to Sima Qian's Shiji.  Unlike Sima's list of Shang dynasty kings, which is closely matched by inscriptions on oracle bones from late in that period, records of Xia rulers have not yet been found in archaeological excavations of contemporary sites, or records on later Shang dynasty oracle bones.","input":"Who was the first emperor of the xia dynasty?"},{"output":"an area with a special flood or mudflow, and/or flood related erosion hazard, as shown on a flood hazard boundary map","context":"A Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) is an area identified by the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an area with a special flood or mudflow, and/or flood related erosion hazard, as shown on a flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map.[1] Areas within the SFHA are designated on the flood insurance rate map as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AR/A1-A30, V1-V30 or V.[2]\\r\\nLand areas that are at high risk for flooding are called special flood hazard areas (SFHAs), or floodplains.

From across the former Roman Empire archaeologists have recovered glass objects that were used in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts. Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt.[2] Because of Egypt's favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing.[n 1]\\r\\nDuring the Late Bronze Age in Egypt (e.g., the Ahhotep \\"Treasure\\") and Western Asia (e.g. Megiddo)[4] there was a rapid growth in glass-making technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass ingots, vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones) and the ubiquitous beads. The alkali of Syrian and Egyptian glass was soda ash, sodium carbonate, which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably halophile seashore plants: (see saltwort). The earliest vessels were 'core-formed', produced by winding a ductile rope of glass round a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings.\\r\\nThreads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of oxides were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled smooth ('marvered') on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly annealed and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for inlays were also often created in moulds. Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state.[5]\\r\\nBy the 15th century BC extensive glass production was occurring in Western Asia, Crete and Egypt and the Mycenaean Greek term ????????????, ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i, meaning \\"workers of lapis lazuli and glass\\" (written in Linear b syllabic script) is attested.[6][7][8][n 2][n 3] It is thought the techniques and recipes required for the initial fusing of glass from raw materials was a closely guarded technological secret reserved for the large palace industries of powerful states. Glass workers in other areas therefore relied on imports of pre-formed glass, often in the form of cast ingots such as those found on the Ulu Burun shipwreck off the coast of modern Turkey.\\r\\nGlass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. It picked up again in its former sites, in Syria and Cyprus, in the 9th century BC, when the techniques for making colorless glass were discovered. The first glassmaking \\"manual\\" dates back to ca. 650 BC. Instructions on how to make glass are contained in cuneiform tablets discovered in the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. In Egypt glass-making did not revive until it was reintroduced in Ptolemaic Alexandria. Core-formed vessels and beads were still widely produced, but other techniques came to the fore with experimentation and technological advancements. During the Hellenistic period many new techniques of glass production were introduced and glass began to be used to make larger pieces, notably table wares. Techniques developed during this period include 'slumping' viscous (but not fully molten) glass over a mould in order to form a dish and 'millefiori' (meaning 'thousand flowers') technique, where canes of multi-colored glass were sliced and the slices arranged together and fused in a mould to create a mosaic-like effect. It was also during this period that colorless or decolored glass began to be prized and methods for achieving this effect were investigated more fully.[12]\\r\\nAccording to Pliny the Elder, Phoenician traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the Belus River. Georgius Agricola, in De re metallica, reported a traditional serendipitous \\"discovery\\" tale of familiar type:\\r\\n\\"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with nitrum being moored at this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass.\\"[13]\\r\\nThis account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels. During the 1st century BC glass blowing was discovered on the Syro-Judean coast, revolutionizing the industry. Glass vessels were now inexpensive compared to pottery vessels. A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world.[citation needed] Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria[citation needed] spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of manganese dioxide), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Over the next 1,000 years, glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond.\\r\\nIndian development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in 1730 BC.[3] Evidence of this culture includes a red-brown glass bead along with a hoard of beads dating to that period, making it the earliest attested glass from the Indus Valley locations.[3] Glass discovered from later sites dating from 600ÿ300 BC displays common colors.[3]\\r\\nChalcolithic evidence of glass has been found in Hastinapur, India.[14] Some of the texts which mention glass in India are the Shatapatha Brahmana and Vinaya Pitaka.[14] However, the first unmistakable evidence in large quantities, dating from the 3rd century BC, has been uncovered from the archaeological site in Takshashila, Pakistan, with bangles, beads, small vessels, and tiles discovered in quantity.[14]\\r\\nBy the 1st century AD, glass was being used for ornaments and casing in South Asia.[14] Contact with the Greco-Roman world added newer techniques, and Indians artisans mastered several techniques of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the succeeding centuries.[14] The Satavahana period of India also produced short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with green glass.[15]\\r\\nIn Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work.[16] The limited archaeological distribution and use of glass objects are evidence of the rarity of the material. Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD.[17] However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the late Zhou Dynasty (1046 BC to 221 BC).\\r\\nChinese learned to manufacture glass comparably later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians.[18] Imported glass objects first reached China during the late Spring and Autumn period ÿ early Warring States period (early 5th century BC), in the form of polychrome eye beads.[19] These imports created the impetus for the production of indigenous glass beads.\\r\\nDuring the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects.[18] The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and Han Dynasty vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects. The glasses from this period contain high levels of barium oxide (BaO) and lead, distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia.[20] At the end of the Han Dynasty (AD 220), the lead-barium glass tradition declined, with glass production only resuming during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.[21]\\r\\nRomans learned to manufacture glass comparably later than Asians. Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire[22] in domestic, funerary[23] and industrial contexts.[24] Glass was used primarily for the production of vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced. Roman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely colored cast glass vessels.\\r\\nHowever, during the 1st century AD, the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colorless or aqua glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels,[25][26] and by the end of the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing, primarily in Alexandria,[27] resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world.\\r\\nIslamic glass continued the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, especially the Sasanian glass of Persia. The Arab poet al-Buhturi (820ÿ897) described the clarity of such glass, \\"Its color hides the glass as if it is standing in it without a container.\\"[28] In the 8th century, the Persian chemist Jbir ibn Hayyn (Geber) described 46 recipes for producing colored glass in Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna (The Book of the Hidden Pearl), in addition to 12 recipes inserted by al-Marrakishi in a later edition of the book.[29] By the 11th century, clear glass mirrors were being produced in Arab Islamic Spain.\\r\\nThe Roman tradition of very fine glassmaking did not continue in the Middle Ages, and Anglo-Saxon glass and other regional traditions were mainly functional pieces, mostly somewhat crude forest glass. The claw beaker was popular as a relatively easy to make but impressive vessel that exploited the unique potential of glass. Only at the end of the period did European glass vessels once again become very fine in quality, imitating those imported from the Islamic world.\\r\\nGlass objects from the 7th and 8th centuries have been found on the island of Torcello near Venice. These form an important link between Roman times and the later importance of that city in the production of the material. Around 1000?AD, an important technical breakthrough was made in Northern Europe when soda glass, produced from white pebbles and burnt vegetation was replaced by glass made from a much more readily available material: potash obtained from wood ashes. From this point on, northern glass differed significantly from that made in the Mediterranean area, where soda remained in common use.[30]\\r\\nUntil the 12th century, stained glass ÿ glass to which metallic or other impurities had been added for coloring ÿ was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for Romanesque art and especially Gothic art. Almost all survivals are in church buildings, but it was also used in grand secular buildings. The 11th century saw the emergence in Germany of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres. The spheres were swung out to form cylinders and then cut while still hot, after which the sheets were flattened. This technique was perfected in 13th century Venice. The Crown glass process was used up to the mid-19th century. In this process, the glassblower would spin approximately 9 pounds (4?kg) of molten glass at the end of a rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1.5?m) in diameter. The disk would then be cut into panes. Domestic glass vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as Forest glass.\\r\\nAnglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.[31] In the 5th century AD with the Roman departure from Britain, there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass.[32] Excavation of Romano-British sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule.[32]\\r\\nThe majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This is directly related to the introduction of Christianity and the construction of churches and monasteries.[32][33] There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical[34] literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings.[32][33][35] Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewelry, both as enamel or as cut glass insets.[36][37]\\r\\nThe center for luxury Italian glassmaking from the 14th century was the island of Murano, which developed many new techniques and became the center of a lucrative export trade in dinnerware, mirrors, and other items. What made Venetian Murano glass significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with soda ash obtained from the Levant, for which the Venetians held the sole monopoly. The clearest and finest glass is tinted in two ways: firstly, a natural coloring agent is ground and melted with the glass. Many of these coloring agents still exist today; for a list of coloring agents, see below. Black glass was called obsidianus after obsidian stone. A second method is apparently to produce a black glass which, when held to the light, will show the true color that this glass will give to another glass when used as a dye.[38]\\r\\nThe Venetian ability to produce this superior form of glass resulted in a trade advantage over other glass producing lands. Muranos reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire might burn down the citys mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano's glassmakers were soon the islands most prominent citizens. Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many took a risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.\\r\\nBohemian glass, or Bohemia crystal, is a decorative glass produced in regions of Bohemia and Silesia, now in the current state of the Czech Republic, since the 13th century.[39] Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia. Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are Skalice (German: Langenau), Kamenicky ?enov (German: Steinsch?nau) and Novy Bor (German: Haida). Both Novy Bor and Kamenicky ?enov have their own Glass Museums with many items dating since around 1600. It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, gem cutter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels.\\r\\nA very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the \\"working period\\" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by George Ravenscroft in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, allowing England to overtake Venice as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Seeking to find an alternative to Venetian cristallo, he used flint as a silica source, but his glasses tended to crizzle, developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency. This was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt.[40]\\r\\nHe was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production and refinement moved from his glasshouse on the Savoy to the seclusion of Henley-on-Thames.[41]\\r\\nBy 1696, after the patent expired, twenty-seven glasshouses in England were producing flint glass and were exporting all over Europe with such success that, in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax on it. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as Excise glasses.[42] The British glass making industry was able to take off with the repeal of the tax in 1845.\\r\\nEvidence of the use of the blown plate glass method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for mirrors and coach plates. Louis Lucas de Nehou and A. Thevart perfected the process of casting Polished plate glass in 1688 in France. Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown \\"sheet\\" glass, had been limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible.[43] This method of production was adopted by the English in 1773 at Ravenhead. The polishing process was industrialized around 1800 with the adoption of a steam engine to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass.\\r\\nThe use of glass as a building material was heralded by The Crystal Palace of 1851, built by Joseph Paxton to house the Great Exhibition. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the British Crown Glass Company (later Chance Brothers) became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass with the expertise of Georges Bontemps, a famous French glassmaker.[n 4] This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a lehr, down which it was carried by a system of rollers.[44] James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.\\r\\nAn early advance in automating glass manufacturing was patented in 1848 by the engineer Henry Bessemer. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing and was later abandoned by its sponsor, Robert Lucas Chance of Chance Brothers, as unviable. Bessemer also introduced an early form of \\"Float Glass\\" in 1843, which involved pouring glass onto liquid tin.\\r\\nIn 1887, the mass production of glass was developed by the firm Ashley in Castleford, Yorkshire. This semi-automatic process used machines that were capable of producing 200 standardized bottles per hour, many times quicker than the traditional methods of manufacture.[45] Chance Brothers also introduced the machine rolled patterned glass method in 1888.[46]\\r\\nIn 1898, Pilkington invented Wired Cast glass, where the glass incorporates a strong steel-wire mesh for safety and security. This was commonly given the misnomer \\"Georgian Wired Glass\\" but it greatly post-dates the Georgian era.[47] The Machine Drawn Cylinder technique was invented in the USA and was the first mechanical method for the drawing of window glass. It was manufactured under licence in the UK by Pilkington from 1910 onwards.\\r\\nIn 1938, the polished plate process was improved by Pilkington which incorporated a double grinding process to give an improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary float glass process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.[48] This method gave the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate[49] and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight.[50] Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.","input":"What were the main types of glass first made?"},{"output":"balsa logs and other native materials","context":"The Kon-Tiki expedition was a 1947 journey by raft across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands, led by Norwegian explorer and writer Thor Heyerdahl. The raft was named Kon-Tiki after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, for whom \\"Kon-Tiki\\" was said to be an old name. Kon-Tiki is also the name of Heyerdahl's book; the Academy Award-winning documentary film chronicling his adventures; and the 2012 dramatised feature film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\\r\\nHeyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times. His aim in mounting the Kon-Tiki expedition was to show, by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at the time, that there were no technical reasons to prevent them from having done so. Although the expedition carried some modern equipment, such as a radio, watches, charts, sextant, and metal knives, Heyerdahl argued they were incidental to the purpose of proving that the raft itself could make the journey.\\r\\nThe Kon-Tiki expedition was funded by private loans, along with donations of equipment from the United States Army. Heyerdahl and a small team went to Peru, where, with the help of dockyard facilities provided by the Peruvian authorities, they constructed the raft out of balsa logs and other native materials in an indigenous style as recorded in illustrations by Spanish conquistadores. The trip began on April 28, 1947. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft for 101 days over 6,900?km (4,300 miles) across the Pacific Ocean before smashing into a reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947. The crew made successful landfall and all returned safely.\\r\\nThor Heyerdahl's book about his experience became a bestseller. It was published in Norwegian in 1948 as The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas, later reprinted as Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft. It appeared with great success in English in 1950, also in many other languages. A documentary motion picture about the expedition, also called Kon-Tiki, was produced from a write-up and expansion of the crew's filmstrip notes and won an Academy Award in 1951. It was directed by Thor Heyerdahl and edited by Olle Nordemar. The voyage was also chronicled in the documentary TV-series The Kon-Tiki Man: The Life and Adventures of Thor Heyerdahl, directed by Bengt Jonson.[1]\\r\\nThe original Kon-Tiki raft is now on display in the Kon-Tiki Museum at Bygd?y in Oslo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKon-Tiki had a six-man crew, all of whom were Norwegian except for Bengt Danielsson, a Swede.[2]\\r\\nThe expedition also carried a pet parrot named Lorita.\\r\\nThe main body of the float was composed of nine balsa tree trunks up to 14?m (45?ft) long, 60?cm (2?ft) in diameter, lashed together with 30?mm (1?1?4?in) hemp ropes. Cross-pieces of balsa logs 5.5?m (18?ft) long and 30?cm (1?ft) in diameter were lashed across the logs at 91?cm (3?ft) intervals to give lateral support. Pine splashboards clad the bow, and lengths of pine 25?mm (1?in) thick and 60?cm (2?ft) wide were wedged between the balsa logs and used as centreboards.\\r\\nThe main mast was made of lengths of mangrove wood lashed together to form an A-frame 8.8?m (29?ft) high. Behind the main-mast was a cabin of plaited bamboo 4.3?m (14?ft) long and 2.4?m (8?ft) wide was built about 1.2ÿ1.5?m (4ÿ5?ft) high, and roofed with banana leaf thatch. At the stern was a 5.8?m (19?ft) long steering oar of mangrove wood, with a blade of fir. The main sail was 4.6 by 5.5?m (15 by 18?ft) on a yard of bamboo stems lashed together. Photographs also show a top-sail above the main sail, and also a mizzen-sail, mounted at the stern.\\r\\nThe raft was partially decked in split bamboo.[4] The main spars were a laminate of wood and reeds and Heyerdahl tested more than twenty different composites before settling on one that proved an effective compromise between bulk and torsional rigidity. No metal was used in the construction.\\r\\nKon-Tiki carried 1,040 litres (275?US?gal) of drinking water in 56 water cans, as well as a number of sealed bamboo rods. The purpose stated by Heyerdahl for carrying modern and ancient containers was to test the effectiveness of ancient water storage. For food Kon-Tiki carried 200 coconuts, sweet potatoes, bottle gourds and other assorted fruit and roots. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps provided field rations, tinned food and survival equipment. In return, the Kon-Tiki explorers reported on the quality and utility of the provisions. They also caught plentiful numbers of fish, particularly flying fish, \\"dolphin fish\\", yellowfin tuna, bonito and shark.\\r\\nThe expedition carried an amateur radio station with the call sign of LI2B operated by former World War II Norwegian resistance radio operators Knut Haugland and Torstein Raaby.[5] Haugland and Raaby maintained regular communication with a number of American, Canadian, and South American stations that relayed Kon Tiki's status to the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C. On August 5, Haugland made contact with a station in Oslo, Norway, 16,000 kilometres (10,000?mi) away.[6][7]\\r\\nKon Tiki's transmitters were powered by batteries and a hand-cranked generator and operated on the 40, 20, 10, and 6-meter bands. Each unit was water resistant, used 2E30 vacuum tubes, and provided approximately 6 watts of RF output; the equivalent of a small flashlight.[8] Two British 3-16?MHz Mark II transmitters were also carried on board, as was a VHF transmitter for communicating with aircraft and a hand-cranked Survival radio of the Gibson Girl type for 500 and 8280?kHz.[5]\\r\\nThe radio receiver used throughout the voyage, a National Radio Company NC-173, once required a thorough drying out after being soaked when landing in Raratonga.[9] The crew once used a hand-cranked emergency transmitter to send out an \\"all well, all well\\" message \\"just in time to head off a massive rescue attempt\\".[10]\\r\\nThe call sign LI2B was used by Heyerdahl again in 1969ÿ70, when he built a papyrus reed raft and sailed from Morocco to Barbados in an attempt to show a possible link between the civilization of ancient Egypt and the New World.[11]\\r\\nKon-Tiki left Callao, Peru, on the afternoon of April 28, 1947. To avoid coastal traffic it was initially towed 80?km (50?mi) out by the Fleet Tug Guardian Rios of the Peruvian Navy, then sailed roughly west carried along on the Humboldt Current.[12]\\r\\nThe crew's first sight of land was the atoll of Puka-Puka on July 30. On August 4, the 97th day after departure, Kon-Tiki reached the Angatau atoll. The crew made brief contact with the inhabitants of Angatau Island, but were unable to land safely. Calculations made by Heyerdahl before the trip had indicated that 97 days was the minimum amount of time required to reach the Tuamotu islands, so the encounter with Angatau showed that they had made good time.\\r\\nOn August 7, the voyage came to an end when the raft struck a reef and was eventually beached on an uninhabited islet off Raroia atoll in the Tuamotu group. The team had travelled a distance of around 6,980?km (4,340?mi; 3,770?nmi) in 101 days, at an average speed of 1.5 knots (2.8?km/h; 1.7?mph).\\r\\nAfter spending a number of days alone on the tiny islet, the crew was greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from the raft. The crew were taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities. Finally the crew were taken off Raroia to Tahiti by the French schooner Tamara, with the salvaged Kon-Tiki in tow.\\r\\nHeyerdahl believed that the original inhabitants of Easter Island were migrants from Peru. He argued that the monumental statues known as moai resembled sculptures more typical of pre-Columbian Peru than any Polynesian designs. He believed that the Easter Island myth of a power struggle between two peoples called the Hanau epe and Hanau momoko was a memory of conflicts between the original inhabitants of the island and a later wave of Native Americans from the Northwest coast, eventually leading to the annihilation of the Hanau epe and the destruction of the island's culture and once-prosperous economy.[13][14]\\r\\nMost historians consider that the Polynesians from the west were the original inhabitants and that the story of the Hanau epe is either pure myth, or a memory of internal tribal or class conflicts.[15][16][17] In 2011 Professor Erik Thorsby of the University of Oslo presented DNA evidence to the Royal Society which whilst agreeing with the west origin also identified a distinctive but smaller genetic contribution from South America.[18] This result was questioned in 2012 because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands.[19] In 2014 further work by a team including Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas (from the Natural History Museum of Denmark) analysed the genomes of 27 native Rapa Nui people and found that their DNA was on average 76 percent Polynesian, 8 percent Native American and 16 percent European. Analysis showed that \\"although the European lineage could be explained by contact with white Europeans after the island was 'discovered' in 1722 by Dutch sailors, the South American component was much older, dating to between about 1280 and 1495, soon after the island was first colonised by Polynesians in around 1200.\\"[20]\\r\\nIn 1954 William Willis sailed alone on a raft Seven Little Sisters from Peru to American Samoa, successfully completing the journey.[21] He sailed 10,800?km (6,700?mi), which was 3,500?km (2,200?mi) farther than Kon-Tiki. In a second great voyage ten years later, he rafted 12,001?km (7,457?mi) from South America to Australia with a metal raft Age Unlimited.\\r\\nIn 1955, the Czech explorer and adventurer Eduard Ingris attempted to recreate the Kon-Tiki expedition on a balsa raft called Kantuta. His first expedition, Kantuta I, took place in 1955ÿ1956 and led to failure. In 1959 Ingris built a new balsa raft, Kantuta II, and tried to repeat the previous expedition. The second expedition was a success. Ingris was able to cross the Pacific Ocean on the balsa raft from Peru to Polynesia.\\r\\nA French seafarer, ric de Bisschop, committed himself in a project he had had for some years: he built a Polynesian raft in order to cross the eastern Pacific Ocean from Tahiti to Chile (contrary to Thor Heyerdahl's crossing); the Tahiti-Nui left Papeete with a crew of five on November 8, 1956. When near the Juan Fernndez Islands (Chile) in May 1957, the raft was in a very poor state and they asked for a towing, but it was damaged during the operation and had to be abandoned, but they could keep all the equipment aboard.\\r\\nA second Tahiti-Nui was built in Constituci܇n, Chile; they left on April 13, 1958, towards Callao, then towards the Marquesas, but they missed their target (after 4 months, it began to sink). His crew built a new smaller raft, the Tahiti Nui III, in the ocean out of the more buoyant parts of the Tahiti Nui II[22] and were swept along towards Cook Islands where on August 30, the raft went aground and was wrecked at Rakahanga atoll. Eric de Bisschop was the only person who died in this accident.\\r\\nA Peruvian expedition led by Carlos Caravedo crossed the Pacific Ocean in 1965 in 115 days in a raft named Tangaroa, of which 18 days were used by the crew to cross Tuamotus, the Tuamotu Archipielago, making Tangaroa the only raft that has managed to cross that dangerous archipelago of French Polynesia by its own means. On November 18, 1965, the Tangaroa ended its journey on the Fakarava island. Fakarava is where the Tangaroa is currently preserved.\\r\\nThe 1973 Las Balsas expedition was the first (and so far only) multiple-raft crossing of the Pacific Ocean in recent history. It is the longest-known raft voyage in history. The expedition was led by Spaniard Vital Alsar, who, in 1970, led the La Balsa expedition, only on that occasion with one raft and three companions. The crossing was successful and, at the time, the longest raft voyage in history, until eclipsed in 1973 by Las Balsas. The purpose of the 1973 expedition was three-fold: (1) to prove that the success of 1970 was no accident, (2) to test different currents in the sea, which Alsar maintained ancient mariners knew as modern humans know road maps, and (3) to show that the original expeditions, directed perhaps toward trade or colonisation, may have consisted of small fleets of balsa rafts.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Tangaroa Expedition recreated the Kon-Tiki voyage using a newly built raft, the Tangaroa, named after the Mori sea-god Tangaroa. Tangaroa's six-man crew was led by Norwegian Torgeir Higraff and included Olav Heyerdahl, grandson of Thor Heyerdahl, Bjarne Krekvik (captain), ?yvin Lauten (executive officer), Swedish Anders Berg (photographer) and Peruvian Roberto Sala.[23] Tangaroa was launched on the same day that Kon-Tiki had beenApril 28and it reached its destination on July 7, which was 30 days faster than Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki which had taken 101 days for the voyage. Tangaroa's speed was credited to the proper use of guaras (centerboards).\\r\\nOn January 30, 2011, An-Tiki, a raft modeled after Kon-Tiki, began a 4,800-kilometre (3,000?mi), 70-day journey across the Atlantic Ocean from the Canary Islands to the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas.[24] The expedition was piloted by four men, aged from 56 to 84 years, led by Anthony Smith.[25] The trip was designed to commemorate the journey in an open boat of survivors from the British steamship Anglo-Saxon, sunk by the German cruiser Widder in 1940. The raft ended its voyage in the Caribbean island of St Maarten, completing its trip to Eleuthera in the following year with Smith and a new crew.[26][27]\\r\\nOn 7 November 2015, two teams with two balsa rafts Rahiti Tane and Tupac Yupanqui left Lima, Peru for Easter Island. Expedition Kon-Tiki2 got its name because it had 2 crews from many nations: Norway, Russia, UK, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, and Peru. It sought to double down on Heyerdahl's voyage by sailing two rafts from South America to Polynesia and then back. Expedition leader was Torgeir Higraff from Tangaroa Expedition (2006). ?yvin Lauten and Kari Sk?r Dahl were captains on the first leg, while Signe Meling and Ola Borgfjord were captains on the second leg. The raft reached Easter Island, but did not complete the return.\\r\\nThe two rafts were made of 11 balsa logs and 10 crossbeams held together by 2000 meters of natural fiber ropes. Tens of thousands of waves, up to six meters tall, hit the rafts in an El Ni?o year. This stress for 16 weeks weakened the ropes, but the crew could not replace all of them.[28][29][30] On March 3, 2016, all crew members were taken on board the Hokuetsu Ushaka freight ship after 115 days of sailing and 4? months at sea.\\r\\nA book documenting the voyage and raft was released in 1948 by Thor Heyerdahl, called The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas.[31]\\r\\nA film documentary about the voyage and raft was released in 1950, called Kon-Tiki.[32] It won the 1951 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.\\r\\nKon-Tiki is a 2012 Norwegian historical dramatized feature film about the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition. It stars P?l Sverre Valheim Hagen as Thor Heyerdahl and is directed by Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg.

The group consists of three singing animated anthropomorphic chipmunks: Alvin, the mischievous troublemaker, who quickly became the star of the group; Simon, the tall, bespectacled intellectual; and Theodore, the chubby, impressionable sweetheart. The trio is managed by their human adoptive father, David (Dave) Seville. In reality, \\"David Seville\\" was Bagdasarian's stage name, and the Chipmunks themselves are named after the executives of their original record label. The characters became a success, and the singing Chipmunks and their manager were given life in several animated cartoon productions, using redrawn, anthropomorphic chipmunks, and eventually films.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voices of the group were all performed by Bagdasarian, who sped up the playback to create high-pitched voices. This oft-used process was not entirely new to Bagdasarian, who had also used it for two previous novelty songs, including \\"Witch Doctor\\", but it was so unusual and well-executed it earned the record two Grammy Awards for engineering. Bagdasarian, performing as the Chipmunks, released a long line of albums and singles, with \\"The Chipmunk Song\\" becoming a number-one single in the United States. After Bagdasarian's untimely death in 1972, the characters' voices were performed by his son Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and the latter's wife Janice Karman in the subsequent incarnations of the 1980s and 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2007 CGI/live-action film adaptation and its 2009 sequel, they were voiced in dialogue by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney. Bagdasarian Jr. and Karman continue to perform the singing voices for Alvin, Theodore and the Chipettes, but Steve Vining does Simon's singing voice. The project has earned five Grammy awards, an American Music Award, a Golden Reel Award, and three Kids' Choice Awards, and has been nominated for three Emmy awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nA third film installment, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, was released in theaters on December 16, 2011. Fox 2000 Pictures and Regency Enterprises announced a fourth installment, titled Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip,[1] released on December 18, 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nA CGI-animated TV series revival, titled ALVINNN!!! and the Chipmunks, premiered on Nickelodeon on August 3, 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958, Ross Bagdasarian Sr. released a novelty song (as David Seville) about being unsuccessful at love until he found a witch doctor who told him how to woo his woman. The song was done by Bagdasarian in his normal voice, except for the \\"magic\\" words, done first in Bagdasarian's pitched-up, pre-Chipmunk voice, then in a duet between his pitched-up voice and his normal voice. The words themselves are nonsense: \\"Oo-ee, oo-ah-ah, ting-tang, walla-walla, bing-bang\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was a hit, holding number one for three weeks in the Billboard Top 100 chart. Nothing makes any reference to chipmunks, but the song is sometimes included on Chipmunk compilations, as if the Chipmunks had provided the voice of the Witch Doctor. Bagdasarian did record a Chipmunks version of \\"Witch Doctor\\", which appeared on the second Chipmunks album, Sing Again with the Chipmunks, in 1960.  Bagdasarian performed the song \\"live\\" (with a pre-recorded track of the pitched-up voice) on The Ed Sullivan Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nBagdasarian (again as Seville) recorded a follow-up song, \\"The Bird on My Head\\", singing a duet with his own sped-up voice as the bird. It also reached the Top 40, peaking at No. 34.[2] While driving in Sequoia National Park, Bagdasarian saw a chipmunk dash in front of him. That moment inspired him to create his chipmunk characters.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technique was imitated by Sheb Wooley's \\"Purple People Eater\\" and The Big Bopper's \\"The Purple People Eater Meets The Witch Doctor.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chipmunks first officially appeared on the scene in a novelty record released in late fall 1958 by Bagdasarian.  The song, originally listed on the record label (Liberty F-55168) as \\"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\\", featured the singing skills of the chipmunk trio.  One phrase in the chorus has Alvin wishing for a hula hoop, which was that year's hot new toy.  The novelty record was highly successful, selling more than 4 million copies in seven weeks, and it launched the careers of its chipmunk stars.  It spent four weeks at Number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from December 22, 1958 to January 12, 1959, succeeding \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\" at Number 1 on the same chart by another fictional animal act, The Teddy Bears.  It also earned three Grammy Awards and a nomination for Record of the Year. At the height of its popularity, Bagdasarian and three chipmunk hand-puppets appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, lip-synching the song.  \\"The Chipmunk Song\\" appeared on the Chipmunks' debut album, Let's All Sing with the Chipmunks, in 1959, and was repeated on Christmas with the Chipmunks, released in 1962.  The song also has been included on several compilation albums.\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Rivers did a parody of this song for his 2000 Christmas album Chipmunks Roasting on an Open Fire which was titled \\"The Twisted Chipmunk Song\\".  In the song, the Chipmunks are referred to as Thagadore (Theodore),  Squeaky (Simon), and Melvin (Alvin).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chipmunks first appeared in comic book form on Dell's Four Color Comics series, issue #1042 (cover-dated Dec. 1959). Alvin, Theodore and Simon were depicted as somewhat realistic, nearly identical anthropomorphic rodents with almond-shaped eyes. When Herb Klynn's Format Films made a deal to develop the Three Chipmunks for animation, the old designs were rejected and new versions of the characters were created. Liberty Records eventually re-issued the early albums with the \\"new\\" Chipmunks and it was this new version of the Chipmunks that was used when Alvin's own title was released by Dell in 1962.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first television series to feature the characters was The Alvin Show. The cartoon gave more distinctive looks and personalities to the three chipmunks than just their voices, and an animated portrayal of Seville was a reasonable caricature of Bagdasarian himself. The series ran from 1961 to 1962, and was one of a small number of animated series to be shown in prime time on CBS. Unfortunately, it was never an immediate success in prime time and was canceled after one season, only to find new life in syndication.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Alvin cartoons, the series also featured the scientist Clyde Crashcup and his assistant Leonardo. Those characters did not feature prominently on any of the later series. Crashcup made a single cameo appearance in A Chipmunk Christmas, and in an episode of Alvin and the Chipmunks. The television series was produced by Format Films for Bagdasarian Film Corporation. Although the series was broadcast in black and white, it was produced and later re-run in color. 26 episodes each were produced for the Alvin and the Chipmunks and Clyde Crashcup segments, along with 52 musical segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final Chipmunks album in the project's original incarnation, The Chipmunks Go to the Movies, was released in 1969. After the death of Ross Bagdasarian in 1972 from a heart attack, the Chipmunks' careers stalled until NBC showed interest in the original show (the network carried Saturday morning reruns of The Alvin Show as a midseason replacement in 1979) and the following year, Excelsior Records released a new album of contemporary songs performed by the Chipmunks. That album, Chipmunk Punk, featured Bagdasarian's son, Ross Bagdasarian Jr., doing the voices of the characters. That album and the continued reruns of the series proved to be popular enough to warrant further new records as well as a new television production, and in 1981, the Chipmunks and Seville returned to television in the Christmas special A Chipmunk Christmas, produced by Chuck Jones, which was first broadcast on NBC on December 14 of that year. Next year, two more albums were released (Chipmunk Rock and The Chipmunks Go Hollywood).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group's name changed from the \\"Chipmunks\\" to \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\".[4] In 1983, a second animated television series for the group, produced by Ruby-Spears Productions, was released. Titled simply Alvin and the Chipmunks, the outline of the show closely paralleled the original Alvin Show. The series lasted eight production seasons, until 1990. In the first season, the show introduced the Chipettes, three female versions of the Chipmunks? Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, who each paralleled the original Chipmunks in personality except for Brittany being vainer than Alvin, with Jeanette smart like Simon, and Eleanor fond of food like Theodore, with their own human guardian, the myopic Miss Beatrice Miller (who arrived for the 1986 season). The success of the show led to the release of a soundtrack album in 1984, Songs from Our TV Shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chipmunks even walked[clarification needed] a variation of NBC's \\"Let's All Be There\\" campaign[clarification needed] for its Saturday-morning lineup in 1984 (shows included The Smurfs, Snorks, Going Bananas, Pink Panther and Sons, Kidd Video, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, Mister T, etc.). After 1988, the show was renamed just The Chipmunks to indicate that there were now two groups of them. Also introduced was the boys' \\"Uncle\\" Harry, who may or may not have actually been a relative. The show reflected contemporaneous trends popular culture; the Chipmunks sang recent hits, and wore contemporary clothing. One \\"documentary\\" episode spoofed John Lennon's 1966 infamous comment that The Beatles had become \\"more popular than Jesus\\", by recalling how the Chipmunks had fallen in popularity after Alvin boasted they were \\"bigger than Mickey Mouse!\\". In 1985, the Chipmunks, along with the Chipettes, were featured in the live stage show, Alvin and the Chipmunks and the Amazing Computer. In 1987, during the fifth season of the show on television, the Chipmunks had their first animated feature film, The Chipmunk Adventure, directed by Janice Karman and Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and released to theaters by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. The film featured the Chipmunks and the Chipettes in a contest traveling around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1988ÿ89 season, the show switched production companies to DIC Entertainment, by which time the Chipmunks had truly become anthropomorphized. In 1990, the show switched titles again to The Chipmunks Go to the Movies. Each episode in this season was a spoof of a Hollywood film, such as Back to the Future, King Kong, and others.[5] In addition, several television specials featuring the characters were also released. At the conclusion of the eighth season, the show was canceled again. In 1990, a documentary was produced about the show entitled Alvin and the Chipmunks/Five Decades with the Chipmunks. In that year, the Chipmunks also teamed up for the only time with other famous cartoon stars (such as Bugs Bunny, Garfield, etc.) for the drug abuse-prevention special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the Chipmunks was totally rebooted in 2007 for its feature film. They are living in a tree, fending for themselves as their parents had taken off to join a hippie commune, and having problems gathering nuts for the winter. Their tree is cut down and carted off to grace the entrance lobby of a city office building, with them in it. They then hitch a ride in  a basket of pastries Dave is carrying and wind up in his home, where they wreak havoc & uproar in his kitchen and get thrown out before showing Dave how well they can sing and becoming celebrities as a result. Despite repeatedly testing Dave's putting up with them, they finally win his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvin is the lead vocalist and is the oldest of the Chipmunks (which is confirmed in the 1980s episode \\"Grounded Chipmunk\\"). He wears a red baseball cap and sweater sporting a yellow \\"A\\". His eyes are blue (amber in the live action/animated films) and his build is thin. In personality, Alvin is enthusiastic, mischievous, charming, wacky, prideful, hot-tempered, and funny. The term look before you leap does not usually apply to Alvin as he is impulsive, excitable, and musically talented. He often makes up harebrained schemes to achieve his goals, whether it be trying to help his brothers, keeping Dave from figuring something out, or getting out of a sticky situation. Alvin seems to refer to his often illogical or crazy plans as \\"challenging the ordinary\\". He is proud of his fame and often comes off as self-centered and vain, but Alvin does have a kind heart and loves his brothers very much, often proving that his heart is stronger than his voice. He's also not ashamed to admit when he's wrong and will help others when the time comes. There are times when Alvin displays true selflessness, such as when he gave his golden harmonica to a sick boy at Christmas and when he helped Theodore get Nathan, a bully, off his back for a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is shown to be infatuated with Brittany, although they often quarrel with each other, but they look out for each other when things look bad. He sometimes struggles with her to prove who is the better, such as when he and Brittany each ran for class president at their school in the animated series, but he is often kind to her and is implied to have a crush on her. He sometimes displays affection for Brittany such as hugging her, kissing her hand or cheeks, and comforting her when she is upset. In one CGI episode, Alvin overheard two girls insulting Brittany and he stood up for her, displaying his gentle side once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike his brothers, Alvin was originally voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. In the animated series and film, he was voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Jr. Justin Long voiced Alvin in the live-action/animated film series. On July 30, 2002, Alvin was No. 44 on TV Guide's list of \\"Top 50 Best Cartoon Characters of All Time\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon is the middle brother and the tallest of the Chipmunks. In addition to having an IQ just north of Einstein, Simon possesses a dry sense of humor as well as keen wit. He wears glasses and blue attire, and has blue eyes (a trait he shares with Alvin). He is kind, gentle, logical, responsible, and at times poetic. He often takes charge when Alvin goes too far with his harebrained schemes. Although Simon tends to disagree and argue with Alvin, he truly loves his brother and sticks by him despite everything. Simon tends to hold grudges, but these are often short-lived as he knows that he should be more forgiving. Simon plays the bass, bass clarinet, saxophone, bagpipes, tuba, and drums, among others. In vocal harmonies, he consistently sings the lower parts due to having a deeper voice than his brothers. He is shown playing the keyboard in the original open for the 1980s series.[citation needed] He was also shown playing guitar in a 1980s Hardee's commercial.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon is often implied to have a crush on Jeanette, as she is like him in many details; wearing glasses and blue or purple attire and having a high IQ, possibly rivalling his own. However, he seems braver in standing up to siblings than her because Jeanette doesn't often stand up for herself when Brittany pushes her around. But like Simon to Alvin, Jeanette shares a sisterly bond with Brittany.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike his brothers, Simon was originally voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. In the animated series and film, he was voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Jr. Matthew Gray Gubler voiced Simon in the live-action/animated film series.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheodore is the child of innocence and the youngest of the Chipmunks. He is shy, loving, sensitive, chubby, gullible, trusting, and na?ve. In short, he is an easy target for Alvin's manipulations. He wears green attire and has green eyes (brown in the CGI animated series). Theodore often holds the swing vote between his two brothers' choices of action: Simon appeals to Theodore's better nature while Alvin goes straight to bribery. He has a big appetite, constantly craving snacks and in one episode, Theodore tried to eat Alvin's hand because of his hunger. He plays the drums, the guitar, and other instruments. In vocal harmonies, his voice is typically the highest. He is fragile yet unpredictable and not very brave, but he will put on a brave face when his brothers are in trouble. At times, he is childish and Alvin's follower, but he is also the glue that binds his brothers despite Alvin and Simon's differences and regular disagreements. Although he is sometimes teased by Alvin, Theodore loves his big brother and knows that Alvin loves him too.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seems to have affection for Eleanor, who shares physical traits with him, but she is smarter, braver and more athletic. They each have a passion for cooking, as Theodore is seen baking Christmas cookies in some Christmas episodes. In the live action/animated films, it is revealed that Theodore is sensitive about his weight and is often hurt when he is criticized for his chubby physique. This also applies to Eleanor, but she is able to stand for herself and wishes that Theodore would do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike his brothers, he was originally voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. In the animated series and film, his voice was provided by Janice Karman, Ross Bagdasarian Jr.'s wife and the voice of all three Chipettes. Jesse McCartney voiced Theodore in the live-action/animated film series.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrittany is the lead singer and leader of The Chipettes and is the female counterpart of Alvin. She wears pink attire and has red hair often drawn up in a ponytail and has blue eyes. Brittany is considerably beautiful, self-centered, ambitious, and vain, but she does have a kind side and is loyal to her sisters, Jeanette and Eleanor. Brittany is often trying to look pretty and desires to make herself popular or get what she wants, but she does learn her lessons and is willing to do the right thing.\\r\\nBrittany often displays affection for Alvin as they are alike in many ways. Although she and Alvin are often quarrelsome with each other and often compete over who is the better, she does stick by his side in tough situations and deep down, she and Alvin do love each other. Brittany pushes Jeanette around a lot and takes advantage of her kindness, but deep down, they love each other very much and care about each other, proving that Brittany does have a gentle side. Eleanor always stands up to Brittany when she tries to push Jeanette around, but they do share a strong sisterly relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeanette is the second eldest sister and smartest of the Chipettes, as well as the tallest. Like Simon, she wears glasses and blue attire. She has brown hair in a bun in the '80s show and a short ponytail in the recent films. Her eyes are green in her TV appearances and The Chipmunk Adventure but were changed to purple in the live-action/CGI films. In personality, Jeanette is intelligent, gentle, kind, compassionate, and attractive. She cares about Simon and gets along with him very well, although the two of them are very shy about their relationship. She is often pushed around by Brittany, but she loves her sister and knows that Brittany loves her too. Jeanette tries to be her best, but she is shy and often viewed as clumsy, as she does have a habit of tripping over her feet. Still, she is beloved by her sisters and finds companionship with their guardian, Miss Miller.\\r\\n\\r\\nEleanor is the youngest of the Chipettes. She has a lot in common with Theodore in terms of body shape and color of attire, but she is braver, more fit and has a better memory. She is blonde with pigtails and has brown eyes in the 80\`s show, which changed to green in the more recent appearances. Eleanor is kind, sweet, trusting, courteous, and fairly pretty. She shares Theodore's love of food and she is also skilled in cooking, and like him, she is the drummer for the Chipettes. Eleanor often stands up to Brittany when she pushes Jeanette around, but she loves her big sister and is always willing to forgive. She seems to have affection for Theodore and they are the two most open about their relationship. Like him, Eleanor is sensitive about her weight and doesn't like to be insulted for it, but she often stands up for herself and wishes to help Theodore gain self-confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid \\"Dave\\" Seville is a quick-tempered yet kind and somewhat insecure songwriter for the musical trio and Chipmunks' adoptive father and confidant. While Dave struggles to remain calm and objective, Alvin often irritates him, causing Dave to yell \\"Alvin!\\", to which Alvin (sometimes) responds with \\"Okay!\\" Dave plays piano and the guitar. He has short black hair and brown eyes. In the original incarnations of the group (including the original recordings and The Alvin Show) he is portrayed by Alvin and the Chipmunks creator Ross Bagdasarian Sr. In the 1983ÿ1990 revival of the show, he is portrayed by Ross Bagdasarian Jr., the son of the original creator.  For the series of films produced from 2007 to 2015, he is portrayed by Jason Lee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1983ÿ1990 animated series, it is revealed that Dave first found the Chipmunks as infants abandoned on the doorstep of his old cottage. At first, he grows to like them but had trouble keeping them from misbehaving as he had important songs to write or else he'd lose his job. On top of that, Dave's landlord is a nasty man who even tries to kill the Chipmunks. However, Dave eventually hears their amazing singing voices and records them, making their song a hit and with the money they earn they manage to move into a large house, which Dave owns and live happily together as one big family. The mother of the Chipmunks has made a few guest appearances, to see how her children are doing, and Dave had to acquaint her with urban ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2007 film, the visuals and history established in the animated show, are totally rebooted. Dave first discovers the boys eating food in his cabinets and he panics and throws them out. He later changes his mind and allows them into his home upon them showing their singing talent. However, the Chipmunks find an old letter and mistakenly think Dave doesn't want them anymore so they go to live with Ian Hawke, their conniving music producer; he begins to miss the boys and frees them from Ian. He welcomes the Chipmunks into his home and eventually he starts to love them like his own children.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in the 2009 sequel Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, Dave plays a minor role in the film, mainly due to his being in the hospital in Paris. This happened due to Alvin accidentally causing a billboard to crash into him and he is sent flying across the room and is severely injured, so he is placed in intensive care. He is rarely seen in the film. His cousin Toby acts as both a main character and the Chipmunks' temporary guardian. Dave appears at the end of the film watching his boys and the Chipettes perform together.\\r\\n\\r\\nDave appears for a third time in Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, where he, the Chipmunks and Chipettes board a cruise ship heading to the International Music Awards. He gets mad at Alvin, Simon and the Chipettes for leaving their cabin room for their own reasons. Later, he teams up with his old enemy, Ian, to find the Chipmunks and Chipettes when the six get blown away while hang-gliding a kite. He & Ian find them and leaves the island with them before its volcano erupts. with Ian getting his career back He later watches his family perform at the International Music Awards; he is last seen on an airplane with them heading for home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth film, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip, Dave now owns a music record company, and moved to a new home with the Chipmunks and Chipettes. Upset from Alvin throwing a surprise birthday bash, to his dismay, he decides to take his lover, Samantha, to Florida for one of his client's album release party, instead of taking the Chipmunks. Both Samantha and Dave leave, leaving Samantha's son, Miles, to stay with the Chipmunks, being that the Chipettes have gone to judge in American Idol. Dave, for most of the movie, is at Florida, having dinners with Samantha. After being suspected of going to propose to her, Dave is unwittingly sabotaged by Miles and the Chipmunks. He also gets upset, as the Chipmunks presumed, ruining his coworker's proposal, and for causing much trouble on their trip to stop him. Alvin, Simon, Theodore, and Miles perform for Dave as an apology, during his client's album release, finally mending the ruined proposal of Dave's coworker. Back to Los Angeles, Dave adopts the boys, and is last seen yelling Alvin's name after he finds his home wrecked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIan is played by comedian David Cross, and serves as the main antagonist in the first two films. He is Dave's friend-turned rival and former college roommate, and serves as the CEO of Jett Records in the first film. One day, the Chipmunks sneak off to his home to audition, whereupon he automatically signs them on to the label. He rockets them to the top of music business but after seeing how much they're truly worth, he attempts to lure them away from Dave for his own profit. His plan ultimately fails, as the Chipmunks have learned of it and escaped from his grasp, thus leaving him to be ousted from his job as CEO of Jett Records. In the second film, Ian is now unemployable, in debt, and lives in the basement of Jett Records stating that he lost everything except his dignity. However, he happens upon The Chipettes, who want to be famous like the Chipmunks, and cannot wait to make them famous, so he takes them in, in hopes of getting his sworn revenge on the Chipmunks. He enrolls the Chipettes into the same school as the Chipmunks, and after showing Dr. Rubin (Wendie Malick) their talent, she agrees to let them battle the Chipmunks for the right to represent the school for the district's music competition. However, in the climax, Ian decides to blow off the competition to have the Chipettes to perform at a Britney Spears concert, and takes them by force, threatening to take them to a barbecue restaurant if they will not comply. Alvin saves the Chipettes from Ian, who then tries to imitate them at the Britney Spears concert, only to get thrown into a dumpster by security guards losing everything again including his dignity. Ian makes his third and final appearance in the third film. Here, Ian has mellowed and now works on the Carnival Dream cruise ship, dressed in a pelican suit because record labels are not interested in hiring him for ruining the concert of the Chipmunks, the Chipettes and for passing on Justin Bieber twice. As a well-respected mascot, he takes his job very seriously and threatens to have Dave and the Chipmunks removed from the ship if they continue to act up. However, he becomes Dave's friend again while helping him find the Chipmunks after they were marooned on the island. In the end, he gets his wealth back by starting a career as a screenwriter, having sold a screenplay about Zoe's story to Hollywood.\\r\\n\\r\\nClaire is Dave's ex-girlfriend who adores the Chipmunks after she finally gets to meet them. She becomes good friends with Dave again by the end of the movie. She is played by Cameron Richardson.\\r\\n\\r\\nDave's immature and very careless first cousin who appeared in the second film. Toby is a slacker who loves to play video games and still lives with his grandmother and Dave's aunt, Jackie Seville, until he figures out what he wants to do with his life. Toby's immaturity keeps him from acting like an adult (although he seems to take on some responsibility in the middle of the film), and he has a crush on the Chipmunks' homeroom and music teacher, Julie Ortega (Erika Casanova), ever since he went to the same school as the Chipmunks. He is played by Chuck star Zachary Levi.\\r\\n\\r\\nZoe is a deluded castaway who was found by the Chipmunks when they end up being marooned on an island that she took refuge. She claims to be on the island for eight or nine years. At first, she was believed to be crash-landed into the island, but it turns out that she intentionally came there to look for treasure. She is played by former SNL actress Jenny Slate and is the antagonist-turned protagonist of the third film.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgent James Suggs is the main antagonist of Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. He is an air marshal who personally despises the Chipmunks for being dumped by his girlfriend and plots to hunt them down and have revenge. He first appears on an airplane where Theodore releases a monkey from a cage who releases several other animals. Suggs confronts the Chipmunks and gets attacked by the animals. He next encounters Alvin at a bar and fights him, but Alvin and the Chipmunks escape. He then chases them, but runs into a sign and gets knocked out. When he finds them at a musical parade he tries to catch them, but gets hit by a trumpet and then gets drunk. He wakes up in a room with a man and finds a tattoo on his stomach and another one of the Chipmunks on his back. He goes to a rental car station and urges a man to get him the fastest car he's got to find the Chipmunks, but it is a yellow and sort of slow car. He initially is embarrassed, but accepts the car. He then finds the Chipmunks in a hotel and catches them in an elevator, but the Chipmunks defeat him by hitting the emergency stop button and leaving him trapped inside. During the mid-credits, he is released by a maid and is escorted to a pool. He then gets confronted by a man who tells him to move, but Suggs refuses and is subsequently carried out by two guards. He is presumably fired as air marshal for harassing the Chipmunks. He is similar to Ian Hawke. He is portrayed by Tony Hale.\\r\\n\\r\\nSamantha is a protagonist of Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. She first appears at a miniature golf course with her son Miles (who is later introduced into the movie). Her occupation is a doctor. She is portrayed by Kimberly Williams-Paisley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kindly, absent-minded adoptive mother of the Chipettes. She occasionally babysits the Chipmunks and has a crush on Dave, even though she's old enough to be his mother. In her youth, she was part of an all-girl singing group called \\"The Thrillers\\". She appeared in the 1983 TV series and was voiced by Dody Goodman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character does not exist in the rebooted concept of the Chipettes.\\r\\n\\r\\nClyde Crashcup?ÿ voiced by Shepard Menken?ÿ is a scientist in a white coat whose experiments invariably failed. His was the only voice heard in many of the episodes, because the other character in the series was his assistant Leonardo, who only whispered into Clyde's ear in order to communicate with him. In one episode, though, Clyde invented a wife, voiced by June Foray. Clyde had one of the four segments, and the Chipmunks starred in the other three (two of which were musical segments). In the episode \\"Crashcup Invents the Birthday Party\\", Foray provided the (all too audible) voice for the mother of Crashcup's inaudible assistant Leonardo.\\r\\n\\r\\nClyde Crashcup was primarily an inventor rather than a researcher, although he tended to \\"invent\\" things which had already been invented. However, in one episode, he built a functioning time machine. He typically would invent something by taking a pencil out of his lab coat's pocket and drawing a picture in midair of his conception: the picture would then become the actual object.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chipmunks' voices were recorded at half the normal tape speed onto audiotape by voice talent (on the 60's records, generally Ross Bagdasarian Sr.'s own voice overdubbed three times, on the post-80's records, studio singers) talking or singing at half the normal speaking rate. When the tape was played back at normal speed, they would sound a full octave higher in pitch, at normal tempo. The technique was by no means new to the Chipmunks. For example, the high and low pitched characters in The Wizard of Oz were achieved by speeding up and slowing down vocal recordings. Also, Mel Blanc's voice characterization for Daffy Duck was sped up to some extent. Now, the same effect is created digitally and in real time with a pitch shift.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the extensive use of this technique with the Chipmunks, coupled with their popularity, linked this technique to them. The term \\"chipmunk-voiced\\" has entered the American vernacular to describe any artificially high-pitched voice. A similar effect could be obtained in playback by merely taking an LP recorded at 33?1?3 RPM and playing it back at 45 or 78 RPM, a trick sometimes tried out by ordinary record listeners. The instrumental portions of the song are sped up as well, however, making it obvious that the music is being played at the wrong speed. Bagdasarian recorded vocals and music at different speeds to combine properly on his recording. Guitarist Les Paul said he visited Bagdasarian's studio in 1958 and helped with the recording.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technique was used extensively in the British puppet show Pinky and Perky, which pre-dated the Chipmunks. The sound was frequently imitated in comedy records, notably \\"Transistor Radio\\" by Benny Hill, \\"Bridget the Midget\\" by Ray Stevens, \\"The Laughing Gnome\\" by David Bowie, and on several tracks on Joe Meek and the Blue Men's album I Hear a New World. The technique also appears in the \\"Yeah! You!\\" line of The Coasters' \\"Charlie Brown\\".  Prince used the technique on several of his songs, as well as Frank Zappa on We're Only In It For The Money and on the instrumental album Hot Rats, among others. The early production style of hip-hop artist Kanye West involved sped-up, high-pitch vocal samples from classic soul records incorporated with his own (additional) instrumentation.[8][9] Due in part to the acclaim of his debut album The College Dropout, such sampling techniques subsequently became much copied by a myriad of other hip-hop producers.[10] In the early '90s rave scene, many breakbeat hardcore productions would utilize the same studio tricks, often taking a cappella from house records and speeding them up to fit the faster tempo. Vocals in songs that used this method would typically be referred to as \\"chipmunk vocals\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chipmunks make a guest appearance on the Canned Heat song \\"The Chipmunk Song\\" (which is not the same song as the 1958 hit) that appeared on their Christmas single.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also appeared on the FOX NFL Sunday intro (which premiered on December 20, 2009) with the cameo character, Digger (the mascot for NASCAR on Fox).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been 8 Alvin and the Chipmunks films.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were six Grammy Awards, an American Music Award, a Golden Reel Award and three Kids Choice Awards in total.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the cult success of the Lorimar Home Video release of the previously successful movie The Chipmunk Adventure on VHS, select episodes of the show from 1983 to 1990, as well as several specials from the '80s and '90s, were released on VHS. Initially, in 1989, they were distributed by Burbank Video. From 1992 to 1996, they were distributed by Buena Vista Home Video. From 1998 to 2000, they were distributed by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. The VHS Chipmunk Video Library titles featured select episodes from the Ruby-Spears and Murakami-Wolf-Swenson eras, but no opening and closing credits were included (even though the opening credits were intact on A Chipmunk Reunion).\\r\\nInstead, each tape opened with previews from the six primary Chipmunk Library titles, set to the 1988 version of the show's theme song titled \\"We're the Chipmunks\\". Also, a synthesized version of the 1983ÿ1987 title card music was used on the Ruby-Spears episodes. However, unlike the syndicated versions for most of these episodes that were airing at the time, these episodes were presented in their original speed, just as they were on NBC, before they were sped-up for syndication. The early-mid-'90s Chipmunk VHS releases featured select episodes from the DiC era. The Universal Home Video releases consisted of the reissue of The Chipmunk Adventure and the two direct-to-video films.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were also VHS releases in the UK that included episodes that have yet to be released in the U.S. on DVD and have never been released in the U.S. on VHS. They consist of \\"The Phantom\\", \\"The Wall\\", \\"Queen of the High School Ballroom\\", \\"Alvin's Not So Superhero\\", \\"Home Sweet Home\\", \\"All Worked Up\\" and \\"Phantom of the Rock Opera\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was also a VHS tape released exclusively in Germany that featured seven different segments (albeit in German). On it were \\"The Wall\\", \\"The Amazing Chipmunks\\", \\"Psychic Alvin\\", \\"A Special Kind of Champion\\", \\"Cookie Chomper III\\", \\"Nightmare on Seville Street\\" and \\"Thinking Cap Trap\\". Of the seven, \\"The Amazing Chipmunks\\", which originally aired alongside \\"The Wall\\", is extremely hard to find in its original English language.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Bagdasarian Productions struck a deal with Paramount Home Video to distribute their latest direct-to-video release, Little Alvin and the Mini-Munks, on DVD. As a result, Paramount continues to distribute selected episodes of the show from 1983 to 1990, as well as several specials from the '80s and '90s on DVD, except for Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein, Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet The Wolfman (the home video rights to these specials are still owned by Universal Studios Home Entertainment) and the live-action films made from 2007 to 2015 (the home video rights to these films are owned by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment). The DVD releases include episodes of the 80's Alvin and the Chipmunks animated series that were previously released on VHS as well as episodes that have been previously unreleased on a home video format. Also one episode of The Alvin Show from the 1960s was released.","input":"When was alvin and the chipmunks first made?"},{"output":"if the net force (the vector sum of all forces acting on an object) is zero, then the velocity of the object is constant","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's laws of motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries,[1] and can be summarised as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three laws of motion were first compiled by Isaac Newton in his Philosophi? Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687.[4] Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems.[5] For example, in the third volume of the text, Newton showed that these laws of motion, combined with his law of universal gravitation, explained Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fourth law is often also described in the bibliography, which states that forces add up like vectors, that is, that forces obey the principle of superposition.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's laws are applied to objects which are idealised as single point masses,[9] in the sense that the size and shape of the object's body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily. This can be done when the object is small compared to the distances involved in its analysis, or the deformation and rotation of the body are of no importance. In this way, even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their original form, Newton's laws of motion are not adequate to characterise the motion of rigid bodies and deformable bodies. Leonhard Euler in 1750 introduced a generalisation of Newton's laws of motion for rigid bodies called Euler's laws of motion, later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a continuum. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton's laws of motion, then Euler's laws can be derived from Newton's laws. Euler's laws can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle structure.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's laws hold only with respect to a certain set of frames of reference called Newtonian or inertial reference frames. Some authors interpret the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is; from this point of view, the second law holds only when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame, and therefore the first law cannot be proved as a special case of the second. Other authors do treat the first law as a corollary of the second.[11][12] The explicit concept of an inertial frame of reference was not developed until long after Newton's death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the given interpretation mass, acceleration, momentum, and (most importantly) force are assumed to be externally defined quantities. This is the most common, but not the only interpretation of the way one can consider the laws to be a definition of these quantities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewtonian mechanics has been superseded by special relativity, but it is still useful as an approximation when the speeds involved are much slower than the speed of light.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first law states that if the net force (the vector sum of all forces acting on an object) is zero, then the velocity of the object is constant. Velocity is a vector quantity which expresses both the object's speed and the direction of its motion; therefore, the statement that the object's velocity is constant is a statement that both its speed and the direction of its motion are constant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first law can be stated mathematically when the mass is a non-zero constant, as,\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently,\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is known as uniform motion. An object continues to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it. If it is at rest, it continues in a state of rest (demonstrated when a tablecloth is skilfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop and the dishes remain in their initial state of rest). If an object is moving, it continues to move without turning or changing its speed. This is evident in space probes that continuously move in outer space. Changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion. In the absence of net forces, a moving object tends to move along a straight line path indefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton placed the first law of motion to establish frames of reference for which the other laws are applicable. The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one frame of reference called a Newtonian or inertial reference frame, relative to which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line at a constant speed.[11][14] Newton's first law is often referred to as the law of inertia. Thus, a condition necessary for the uniform motion of a particle relative to an inertial reference frame is that the total net force acting on it is zero. In this sense, the first law can be restated as:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every material universe, the motion of a particle in a preferential reference frame  is determined by the action of forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity of the particle is constant in . That is, a particle initially at rest or in uniform motion in the preferential frame  continues in that state unless compelled by forces to change it.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's first and second laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame. Any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame, i.e. Galilean invariance or the principle of Newtonian relativity.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second law can also be stated in terms of an object's acceleration. Since Newton's second law is valid only for constant-mass systems,[17][18][19] m can be taken outside the differentiation operator by the constant factor rule in differentiation. Thus,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere F is the net force applied, m is the mass of the body, and a is the body's acceleration. Thus, the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration. In other words, if a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it. An application of this notation is the derivation of G Subscript C.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsistent with the first law, the time derivative of the momentum is non-zero when the momentum changes direction, even if there is no change in its magnitude; such is the case with uniform circular motion. The relationship also implies the conservation of momentum: when the net force on the body is zero, the momentum of the body is constant. Any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force. A different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's second law is an approximation that is increasingly worse at high speeds because of relativistic effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn impulse J occurs when a force F acts over an interval of time t, and it is given by[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince force is the time derivative of momentum, it follows that\\r\\n\\r\\nThis relation between impulse and momentum is closer to Newton's wording of the second law.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nImpulse is a concept frequently used in the analysis of collisions and impacts.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nVariable-mass systems, like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases, are not closed and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law;[18] that is, the following formula is wrong:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe falsehood of this formula can be seen by noting that it does not respect Galilean invariance: a variable-mass object with F?= 0 in one frame will be seen to have F?R 0 in another frame.[17]\\r\\nThe correct equation of motion for a body whose mass m varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by applying the second law to the entire, constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected/accreted mass; the result is[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere u is the velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body. From this equation one can derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system, for example, the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.\\r\\nUnder some conventions, the quantity u?dm/dt on the left-hand side, which represents the advection of momentum, is defined as a force (the force exerted on the body by the changing mass, such as rocket exhaust) and is included in the quantity F. Then, by substituting the definition of acceleration, the equation becomes F?= ma.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if one object A exerts a force FA on a second object B, then B simultaneously exerts a force FB on A, and the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: FA = ?FB.[24] The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies,[25][26] or different regions within one body, and thus that there is no such thing as a force that is not accompanied by an equal and opposite force. In some situations, the magnitude and direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies, say Body A; the force exerted by Body A on Body B is called the \\"action\\", and the force exerted by Body B on Body A is called the \\"reaction\\". This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with FA called the \\"action\\" and FB the \\"reaction\\". In other situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn't necessary to identify one force as the \\"action\\" and the other as the \\"reaction\\". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the action and which is called reaction; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two forces in Newton's third law are of the same type (e.g., if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car's tires, then it is also a frictional force that Newton's third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road).\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the floor pushes against the person. Similarly, the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tiresthe tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forwardboth the person and the water push against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the original Latin of Newton's Principia:\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslated to English, this reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the Earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens. He thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest, and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it, otherwise it would stop moving. Galileo Galilei, however, realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body, i.e., acceleration, but no force is needed to maintain its velocity. In other words, Galileo stated that, in the absence of a force, a moving object will continue moving. (The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what Johannes Kepler had called inertia.) This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the \\"law of inertia\\"no force means no acceleration, and hence the body will maintain its velocity. As Newton's first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which Galileo had already described, Newton appropriately gave credit to Galileo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural philosophers and scientists independently, including Thomas Hobbes in his Leviathan.[29] The 17th-century philosopher and mathematician Ren Descartes also formulated the law, although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's original Latin reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was translated quite closely in Motte's 1729 translation as:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to modern ideas of how Newton was using his terminology,[32] this is understood, in modern terms, as an equivalent of:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the body, and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis may be expressed by the formula F = p', where p' is the time derivative of the momentum p. This equation can be seen clearly in the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, in a glass case in which Newton's manuscript is open to the relevant page.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotte's 1729 translation of Newton's Latin continued with Newton's commentary on the second law of motion, reading:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sense or senses in which Newton used his terminology, and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood, have been extensively discussed by historians of science, along with the relations between Newton's formulation and modern formulations.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslated to English, this reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's Scholium (explanatory comment) to this law:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinges upon another, and by its force changes the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, as the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the above, as usual, motion is Newton's name for momentum, hence his careful distinction between motion and velocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton used the third law to derive the law of conservation of momentum;[35] from a deeper perspective, however, conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via Noether's theorem from Galilean invariance), and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when force fields as well as particles carry momentum, and in quantum mechanics. \\r\\n\\r\\nNewton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life. Newton's laws of motion, together with his law of universal gravitation and the mathematical techniques of calculus, provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions. However, Newton's laws (combined with universal gravitation and classical electrodynamics) are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances, most notably at very small scales, very high speeds (in special relativity, the Lorentz factor must be included in the expression for momentum along with the rest mass and velocity) or very strong gravitational fields. Therefore, the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a semiconductor, optical properties of substances, errors in non-relativistically corrected GPS systems and superconductivity. Explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories, including general relativity and quantum field theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn quantum mechanics, concepts such as force, momentum, and position are defined by linear operators that operate on the quantum state; at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light, Newton's laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects. At speeds comparable to the speed of light, the second law holds in the original form F?=?dp/dt, where F and p are four-vectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern physics, the laws of conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum are of more general validity than Newton's laws, since they apply to both light and matter, and to both classical and non-classical physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can be stated simply, \\"Momentum, energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause force is the time derivative of momentum, the concept of force is redundant and subordinate to the conservation of momentum, and is not used in fundamental theories (e.g., quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, general relativity, etc.). The standard model explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as gauge forces originate out of exchange by virtual particles. Other forces, such as gravity and fermionic degeneracy pressure, also arise from the momentum conservation. Indeed, the conservation of 4-momentum in inertial motion via curved space-time results in what we call gravitational force in general relativity theory. The application of the space derivative (which is a momentum operator in quantum mechanics) to the overlapping wave functions of a pair of fermions (particles with half-integer spin) results in shifts of maxima of compound wavefunction away from each other, which is observable as the \\"repulsion\\" of the fermions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton stated the third law within a world-view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles. However, he was prepared for philosophical criticism of this action at a distance, and it was in this context that he stated the famous phrase \\"I feign no hypotheses\\". In modern physics, action at a distance has been completely eliminated, except for subtle effects involving quantum entanglement. (In particular, this refers to Bell's theorem ÿ that no local model can reproduce the predictions of quantum theory.) Despite only being an approximation, in modern engineering and all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and satellites, the concept of action at a distance is used extensively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of the second law of thermodynamics by Carnot in the 19th century showed that not every physical quantity is conserved over time, thus disproving the validity of inducing the opposite metaphysical view from Newton's laws. Hence, a \\"steady-state\\" worldview based solely on Newton's laws and the conservation laws does not take entropy into account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still forever, is a truth that no man doubts. But [the proposition] that when a thing is in motion it will eternally be in motion unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be the same (namely that nothing can change itself), is not so easily assented to. For men measure not only other men but all other things by themselves. And because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude, [they] think every thing else grows weary of motion and seeks repose of its own accord, little considering whether it be not some other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves, consists.","input":"What does the first law of motion state?"},{"output":"July 7, 1937","context":"","input":"When did the second sino japanese war start?"},{"output":"Castries, Saint Lucia","context":"The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) is a superior court of record for the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS),[1] including six independent states: Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and three British Overseas Territories (Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, and Montserrat).

During the climax of the story, it is revealed that she opened the Chamber of Secrets, and is attacking Muggle-born students while being possessed by Tom Riddle's (Lord Voldemort's) old school diary. Lucius Malfoy had slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron in Flourish and Blotts prior to the term. She has little involvement in Prisoner of Azkaban, though she is studying at Hogwarts throughout the book. In Goblet of Fire, her role was larger as she attends the Quidditch World Cup and the Yule Ball with Neville Longbottom and can be seen in background appearances.\\r\\nIn Order of the Phoenix, Ginny has \\"given up on Harry months ago\\" (though this is merely a ruse as Hermione previously advised her to pretend to not be as interested in Harry and go out with a few other boys so Harry would eventually notice her),[4] and has a boyfriend, Michael Corner, whom she met at the Yule Ball. When Umbridge punishes Harry with a \\"lifetime\\" Quidditch ban, Ginny replaces him as Gryffindor Seeker. She joins Dumbledore's Army and is one of five members who accompany Harry in his attempt to rescue Sirius Black from the Department of Mysteries. During the last part of the book, Ginny breaks up with Michael due to his sulking over Ravenclaw losing the Quidditch Cup final to Gryffindor, and replaces him with Dean Thomas. Towards the end of this book Ginny participates in the battle inside the Ministry of Magic, but is forced to withdraw from the action due to a broken left ankle.\\r\\nIn Half-Blood Prince, after she casts the Bat-Bogey Hex on Zacharias Smith, Professor Slughorn respects her magical abilities enough to invite her to join his \\"Slug Club\\".

After witnessing Ginny kissing Dean in an empty corridor, Harry has an angry internal reaction. This reaction surprises him and upon reflection, he realises his attraction to Ginny. Since Ron vocally objects to Dean going out with his sister, Harry fears his reaction would be the same with him. Ginny's relationship with Dean ends altogether in April following an accidental nudge from Harry under the effects of Felix Felicis, which Ginny interprets as Dean unnecessarily trying to help her through the portrait hole.[5] Ginny and Harry share their first kiss after Gryffindor again wins the Quidditch Cup over Ravenclaw, thus initiating their relationship. After Dumbledore's death, however, Harry decides to end their relationship as he fears his love for Ginny would place her in danger.\\r\\nPropelled by the revelation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are leaving to seek the remaining Horcruxes in Deathly Hallows, Ginny kisses Harry in her bedroom, and they realise that they both still have intense feelings for each other.

As Ron is on the run with Harry and Hermione, Ginny is forced to go into hiding with her family. Though underage, she takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts despite her mother's and Harry's disapproval.[6] After Harry's supposed death, she, Hermione, and Luna take on Bellatrix Lestrange, who nearly strikes Ginny with a Killing Curse, infuriating Molly Weasley to the point of intervening and slaying Bellatrix herself.[7]\\r\\nIn the epilogue, set nineteen years after the events of Deathly Hallows, Harry and Ginny have three children: James, Albus and Lily. Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ginny and Harry are married, news articles and other sources treat it as a fact.[8][9][10] Rowling elaborated on Ginny's future after the release of the book, saying that after leaving Hogwarts, she joined the Holyhead Harpies and, after spending a few years as a celebrated player, retired to become the senior Quidditch correspondent at the Daily Prophet, and to start a family with Harry.[11][12] In the sequel play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Ginny must help Harry reconcile with their wayward son Albus Severus Potter, and references to events in previous books are mentioned. Her job on The Daily Prophet is briefly mentioned when Draco accuses her of promoting suspicion against former Death Eaters, but she states that her articles are purely sport-related.\\r\\nGinny is described as an extremely pretty girl. She has the typical Weasley family traits: flaming red hair (which she wears in a long mane) and a freckled complexion. She is of petite stature, commented on by several characters, and has bright brown eyes like her mother. When she blushes (which was often around Harry Potter in the early years of their friendship), she goes a shade of red that matches her hair. When in a highly emotional state she is known to acquire a \\"hard, blazing look\\".\\r\\nGinny is a forceful, independent girl who often speaks her mind. She has an energetic, lively personality; having feelings for Harry, however, during the first few years of their friendship, she became shy and withdrawn in his presence. According to Harry, growing up with six older brothers toughened her up. Ginny is not afraid to stand up to anybody, friends and enemies alike. Notably, she stands up to Draco Malfoy on their first meeting in Flourish and Blotts when he insults Harry in Chamber of Secrets. She even stands up to Hermione, her close friend in defence of Harry's use of the Sectumsempra curse. Ginny was popular during their time at Hogwarts, and was fancied by numerous boys. Ron in particular felt that Ginny was \\"too popular for her own good\\". Ginny is notably difficult to intimidate or frighten, as seen during her moments of standing up to Harry, particularly in Order of the Phoenix.\\r\\nGinny is a very talented and powerful witch. At the age of fourteen she was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus  a very advanced piece of magic and proof that she possessed superior magical ability. She is also a gifted flier and Quidditch player, in particular having scored \\"seventeen goals to boot\\" during a Quidditch practice. Ginny became known to use very adeptly the Bat-Bogey Hex, most notably on Draco Malfoy and Zacharias Smith.\\r\\nBonnie Wright played Ginny in the Harry Potter film series, and voiced the character in the Order of Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 video games. Ginny was voiced by Victoire Robinson for the Chamber of Secrets game, and by Annabel Scholey in Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Poppy Miller was cast as the adult Ginny in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.[13] Wright has described the character of Ginny as \\"outgoing, friendly and confident.\\"[14] In an interview with The Telegraph prior to the release of Order of the Phoenix, Wright revealed that she got the role because her brother had read the books and told her she reminded him of Ginny, and recommended that she audition for the part.[15]","input":"When did ginny weasley join the quidditch team?"},{"output":"C# 7.0","context":"CLR: MIT/X11[4]\\r\\nMono compiler: dual GPLv3 and MIT/X11\\r\\nLibraries: LGPLv2\\r\\nC#[b] (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.\\r\\nC# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.[13] Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 7.0, which was released in 2017 along with Visual Studio 2017.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ECMA standard lists these design goals for C#:[13]\\r\\nDuring the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC).[15][16] In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for \\"C-like Object Oriented Language\\".[17] Microsoft had considered keeping the name \\"Cool\\" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.\\r\\nC#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft is Anders Hejlsberg, who was previously involved with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that flaws[citation needed] in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language itself.\\r\\nJames Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an \\"imitation\\" of Java; Gosling further said that \\"[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted.\\"[18][19] Klaus Kreft and Angelika Langer (authors of a C++ streams book) stated in a blog post that \\"Java and C# are almost identical programming languages. Boring repetition that lacks innovation,\\"[20] \\"Hardly anybody will claim that Java or C# are revolutionary programming languages that changed the way we write programs,\\" and \\"C# borrowed a lot from Java - and vice versa. Now that C# supports boxing and unboxing, we'll have a very similar feature in Java.\\"[21] In July 2000, Anders Hejlsberg said that C# is \\"not a Java clone\\" and is \\"much closer to C++\\" in its design.[22]\\r\\nSince the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming somewhat less similar. One of the first major departures came with the addition of generics to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of reification to provide \\"first-class\\" generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time.[23] Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the LINQ extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous types.[24] These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of \\"boilerplate\\" code that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.[25]\\r\\nC# used to have a mascot called Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg). It was retired on January 29, 2004.[26]\\r\\nC# was originally submitted to the ISO subcommittee JTC 1/SC 22 for review,[27] under ISO/IEC 23270:2003,[28] was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.[29]\\r\\nThe name \\"C sharp\\" was inspired by musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.[30] This is similar to the language name of C++, where \\"++\\" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four \\"+\\" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.[31]\\r\\nDue to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol (U+266F ? MUSIC SHARP SIGN (HTML?&#9839;)) is not present on most keyboard layouts, the number sign (U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN (HTML?&#35;)) was chosen to approximate the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language.[32] This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification.[13] However, when it is practical to do so (for example, in advertising or in box art[33]), Microsoft uses the intended musical symbol.\\r\\nThe \\"sharp\\" suffix has been used by a number of other .NET languages that are variants of existing languages, including J# (a .NET language also designed by Microsoft that is derived from Java 1.1), A# (from Ada), and the functional programming language F#.[34] The original implementation of Eiffel for .NET was called Eiffel#,[35] a name retired since the full Eiffel language is now supported. The suffix has also been used for libraries, such as Gtk# (a .NET wrapper for GTK+ and other GNOME libraries) and Cocoa# (a wrapper for Cocoa).\\r\\n.NET Framework 2.0 (Except LINQ)[36]\\r\\n.NET Framework 3.0 (Except LINQ)[36]\\r\\n.NET Framework 3.5\\r\\nThe core syntax of C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and Java. In particular:\\r\\nSome notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C++, and Java where noted, are:\\r\\nBy design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying Common Language Infrastructure?(CLI).[46] Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime, or generate Common Intermediate Language (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Theoretically, a C# compiler could generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or Fortran.\\r\\nC# supports strongly typed implicit variable declarations with the keyword var, and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword new[] followed by a collection initializer.\\r\\nC# supports a strict Boolean data type, bool. Statements that take conditions, such as while and if, require an expression of a type that implements the true operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as if(a) require only that a is convertible to bool, allowing a to be an int, or a pointer. C# disallows this \\"integer meaning true or false\\" approach, on the grounds that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly bool can prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as if (a = b) (use of assignment = instead of equality ==, which while not an error in C or C++, will be caught by the compiler anyway).\\r\\nC# is more type safe than C++. The only implicit conversions by default are those that are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.\\r\\nC# has explicit support for covariance and contravariance in generic types, unlike C++ which has some degree of support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods.\\r\\nEnumeration members are placed in their own scope.\\r\\nThe C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions.\\r\\nLocal variables cannot shadow variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++.\\r\\nMeta programming via C# attributes is part of the language. Many of these attributes duplicate the functionality of GCC's and VisualC++'s platform-dependent preprocessor directives.\\r\\nLike C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the keyword virtual to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses.\\r\\nExtension methods in C# allow programmers to use static methods as if they were methods from a class's method table, allowing programmers to add methods to an object that they feel should exist on that object and its derivatives.\\r\\nThe type dynamic allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time object composition.\\r\\nC# has support for strongly-typed function pointers via the keyword delegate. Like the Qt framework's pseudo-C++ signal and slot, C# has semantics specifically surrounding publish-subscribe style events, though C# uses delegates to do so.\\r\\nC# offers Java-like synchronized method calls, via the attribute [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)], and has support for mutually-exclusive locks via the keyword lock.\\r\\nC# provides properties as syntactic sugar for a common pattern in which a pair of methods, accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) encapsulate operations on a single attribute of a class. No redundant method signatures for the getter/setter implementations need be written, and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more verbose method calls.\\r\\nA C# namespace provides the same level of code isolation as a Java package or a C++ namespace, with very similar rules and features to a package.\\r\\nIn C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as unsafe, and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a \\"live\\" object or have the well-defined null value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a \\"dead\\" object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of a value-type, array, string, or a block of memory allocated on a stack. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the System.IntPtr type, but it cannot dereference them.\\r\\nManaged memory cannot be explicitly freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses the problem of memory leaks by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory that is no longer needed.\\r\\nChecked exceptions are not present in C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based on the issues of scalability and versionability.[47]\\r\\nUnlike C++, C# does not support multiple inheritance, although a class can implement any number of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.\\r\\nHowever, unlike Java, C# supports operator overloading. Only the most commonly overloaded operators in C++ may be overloaded in C#.\\r\\nThough primarily an imperative language, C# 2.0 offered limited support for functional programming through first-class functions and closures in the form of anonymous delegates. C# 3.0 expanded support for functional programming with the introduction of a lightweight syntax for lambda expressions, extension methods (an affordance for modules), and a list comprehension syntax in the form of a \\"query comprehension\\" language.\\r\\nC# has a unified type system. This unified type system is called Common Type System (CTS).[48]\\r\\nA unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the System.Object class. For example, every type inherits a ToString() method.\\r\\nCTS separates data types into two categories:[48]\\r\\nInstances of value types do not have referential identity nor referential comparison semantics - equality and inequality comparisons for value types compare the actual data values within the instances, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded. Value types are derived from System.ValueType, always have a default value, and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor. Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as int (a signed 32-bit integer), float (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number), char (a 16-bit Unicode code unit), and System.DateTime (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are enum (enumerations) and struct (user defined structures).\\r\\nIn contrast, reference types have the notion of referential identity - each instance of a reference type is inherently distinct from every other instance, even if the data within both instances is the same. This is reflected in default equality and inequality comparisons for reference types, which test for referential rather than structural equality, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded (such as the case for System.String). In general, it is not always possible to create an instance of a reference type, nor to copy an existing instance, or perform a value comparison on two existing instances, though specific reference types can provide such services by exposing a public constructor or implementing a corresponding interface (such as ICloneable or IComparable). Examples of reference types are object (the ultimate base class for all other C# classes), System.String (a string of Unicode characters), and System.Array (a base class for all C# arrays).\\r\\nBoth type categories are extensible with user-defined types.\\r\\nBoxing is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type.[48] Boxing in C# is implicit.\\r\\nUnboxing is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type.[48] Unboxing in C# requires an explicit type cast. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).[49]\\r\\nExample:\\r\\nThe C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).\\r\\nThe following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic \\"Hello world\\" example:\\r\\nWhat will display on the program is:\\r\\nEach line has a purpose:\\r\\nThe above line of code tells the compiler to use System as a candidate prefix for types used in the source code. In this case, when the compiler sees use of the Console type later in the source code, it tries to find a type named Console, first in the current assembly, followed by all referenced assemblies. In this case the compiler fails to find such a type, since the name of the type is actually System.Console. The compiler then attempts to find a type named System.Console by using the System prefix from the using statement, and this time it succeeds. The using statement allows the programmer to state all candidate prefixes to use during compilation instead of always using full type names.\\r\\nAbove is a class definition. Everything between the following pair of braces describes Program.\\r\\nThis declares the class member method where the program begins execution. The .NET runtime calls the Main method. (Note: Main may also be called from elsewhere, like any other method, e.g. from another method of Program.) The static keyword makes the method accessible without an instance of Program. Each console application's Main entry point must be declared static. Otherwise, the program would require an instance, but any instance would require a program. To avoid that irresolvable circular dependency, C# compilers processing console applications (like that above) report an error, if there is no static Main method. The void keyword declares that Main has no return value.\\r\\nThis line writes the output. Console is a static class in the System namespace. It provides an interface to the standard input, output, and error streams for console applications. The program calls the Console method WriteLine, which displays on the console a line with the argument, the string \\"Hello, world!\\".\\r\\nA GUI example:\\r\\nThis example is similar to the previous example, except that it generates a dialog box that contains the message \\"Hello, World!\\" instead of writing it to the console.\\r\\nIn August 2001, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard and Intel Corporation co-sponsored the submission of specifications for C# as well as the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to the standards organization Ecma International. In December 2001, ECMA released ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. C# became an ISO standard in 2003 (ISO/IEC 23270:2003 - Information technology  Programming languages  C#). ECMA had previously adopted equivalent specifications as the 2nd edition of C#, in December 2002.\\r\\nIn June 2005, ECMA approved edition 3 of the C# specification, and updated ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and generics (somewhat similar to C++ templates).\\r\\nIn July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1, via the latter's Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6ÿ9 months.\\r\\nThe C# language definition and the CLI are standardized under ISO and Ecma standards that provide reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing protection from patent claims.\\r\\nMicrosoft has agreed not to sue open source developers for violating patents in non-profit projects for the part of the framework that is covered by the OSP.[50] Microsoft has also agreed not to enforce patents relating to Novell products against Novell's paying customers[51] with the exception of a list of products that do not explicitly mention C#, .NET or Novell's implementation of .NET (The Mono Project).[52] However, Novell maintains that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents.[53] Microsoft has also made a specific agreement not to enforce patent rights related to the Moonlight browser plugin, which depends on Mono, provided it is obtained through Novell.[54]\\r\\nMicrosoft is leading the development of the open-source reference C# compiler and set of tools, previously codenamed \\"Roslyn\\". The compiler, which is entirely written in managed code (C#), has been opened up and functionality surfaced as APIs. It is thus enabling developers to create refactoring and diagnostics tools.[55][56] While other implementations of C# exist, Visual C# is by far the one most commonly used.[57]\\r\\nOther C# compilers, which often including an implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure and the .NET class libraries up to .NET 2.0:","input":"What is the latest version of c#?"},{"output":"September 14, 1814","context":"\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" is the national anthem of the United States of America. The lyrics come from \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\",[2] a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large American flag, the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the American victory.\\r\\nThe poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. \\"To Anacreon in Heaven\\" (or \\"The Anacreontic Song\\"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. Set to Key's poem and renamed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", it soon became a well-known American patriotic song. With a range of one octave and one fifth (a semitone more than an octave and a half), it is known for being difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.\\r\\n\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" was recognized for official use by the United States Navy in 1889, and by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1508, codified at 36 U.S.C.??301), which was signed by President Herbert Hoover.\\r\\nBefore 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom. \\"Hail, Columbia\\" served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\", whose melody is identical to \\"God Save the Queen\\", the British national anthem,[3] also served as a de facto anthem.[4] Following the War of 1812 and subsequent American wars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among them \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", as well as \\"America the Beautiful\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 3, 1814, following the Burning of Washington and the Raid on Alexandria, Francis Scott Key and John Stuart Skinner set sail from Baltimore aboard the ship HMS Minden, flying a flag of truce on a mission approved by President James Madison. Their objective was to secure an exchange of prisoners, one of whom was Dr. William Beanes, the elderly and popular town physician of Upper Marlboro and a friend of Key's who had been captured in his home. Beanes was accused of aiding the arrest of British soldiers. Key and Skinner boarded the British flagship HMS Tonnant on September 7 and spoke with Major General Robert Ross and Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane over dinner while the two officers discussed war plans. At first, Ross and Cochrane refused to release Beanes, but relented after Key and Skinner showed them letters written by wounded British prisoners praising Beanes and other Americans for their kind treatment.\\r\\nBecause Key and Skinner had heard details of the plans for the attack on Baltimore, they were held captive until after the battle, first aboard HMS Surprise and later back on HMS Minden. After the bombardment, certain British gunboats attempted to slip past the fort and effect a landing in a cove to the west of it, but they were turned away by fire from nearby Fort Covington, the city's last line of defense.\\r\\nDuring the rainy night, Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that the fort's smaller \\"storm flag\\" continued to fly, but once the shell and Congreve rocket[5] barrage had stopped, he would not know how the battle had turned out until dawn. On the morning of September 14, the storm flag had been lowered and the larger flag had been raised.\\r\\nDuring the bombardment, HMS Terror and HMS Meteor provided some of the \\"bombs bursting in air\\".\\r\\nKey was inspired by the American victory and the sight of the large American flag flying triumphantly above the fort. This flag, with fifteen stars and fifteen stripes, had been made by Mary Young Pickersgill together with other workers in her home on Baltimore's Pratt Street. The flag later came to be known as the Star-Spangled Banner and is today on display in the National Museum of American History, a treasure of the Smithsonian Institution. It was restored in 1914 by Amelia Fowler, and again in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program.\\r\\nAboard the ship the next day, Key wrote a poem on the back of a letter he had kept in his pocket. At twilight on September 16, he and Skinner were released in Baltimore. He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel, where he was staying, and titled it \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\".\\r\\nMuch of the idea of the poem, including the flag imagery and some of the wording, is derived from an earlier song by Key, also set to the tune of \\"The Anacreontic Song\\". The song, known as \\"When the Warrior Returns\\",[6] was written in honor of Stephen Decatur and Charles Stewart on their return from the First Barbary War.\\r\\nAbsent elaboration by Francis Scott Key prior to his death in 1843, some have speculated in modern times about the meaning of phrases or verses. According to British historian Robin Blackburn, the words \\"the hireling and slave\\" allude to the thousands of ex-slaves in the British ranks organised as the Corps of Colonial Marines, who had been liberated by the British and demanded to be placed in the battle line \\"where they might expect to meet their former masters.\\"[7] Nevertheless, Professor Mark Clague, a professor of musicology at the University of Michigan, argues that the \\"middle two verses of Key's lyric vilify the British enemy in the War of 1812\\" and \\"in no way glorifies or celebrates slavery.\\"[8] Clague writes that \\"For Key ... the British mercenaries were scoundrels and the Colonial Marines were traitors who threatened to spark a national insurrection.\\"[8] This harshly anti-British nature of Verse 3 led to its omission in sheet music in World War I, when Britain and the U.S. were allies.[8] Responding to the assertion of writer Jon Schwarz of The Intercept that the song is a \\"celebration of slavery,\\"[9] Clague said that: \\"The reference to slaves is about the use, and in some sense the manipulation, of black Americans to fight for the British, with the promise of freedom. The American forces included African-Americans as well as whites. The term 'freemen,' whose heroism is celebrated in the fourth stanza, would have encompassed both.\\"[10]\\r\\nOthers suggest that \\"Key may have intended the phrase as a reference to the British Navys practice of impressment (kidnapping sailors and forcing them to fight in defense of the crown), or as a semi-metaphorical slap at the British invading force as a whole (which included a large number of mercenaries).\\"[11]\\r\\nKey gave the poem to his brother-in-law Judge Joseph H. Nicholson who saw that the words fit the popular melody \\"The Anacreontic Song\\", by English composer John Stafford Smith. This was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore, who anonymously made the first known broadside printing on September 17; of these, two known copies survive.\\r\\nOn September 20, both the Baltimore Patriot and The American printed the song, with the note \\"Tune: Anacreon in Heaven\\". The song quickly became popular, with seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire printing it. Soon after, Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", although it was originally called \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\". Thomas Carr's arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from \\"The Anacreontic Song\\".[12] The song's popularity increased, and its first public performance took place in October, when Baltimore actor Ferdinand Durang sang it at Captain McCauley's tavern. Washington Irving, then editor of the Analectic Magazine in Philadelphia, reprinted the song in November 1814.\\r\\nBy the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in popular use. Seeking a singular, standard version, President Woodrow Wilson tasked the U.S. Bureau of Education with providing that official version. In response, the Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement. Those musicians were Walter Damrosch, Will Earhart, Arnold J. Gantvoort, Oscar Sonneck and John Philip Sousa. The standardized version that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 5, 1917, in a program that included Edward Elgar's Carillon and Gabriel Piern's The Children's Crusade. The concert was put on by the Oratorio Society of New York and conducted by Walter Damrosch.[13] An official handwritten version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows all five men's votes tallied, measure by measure.[14]\\r\\nThe Italian opera composer Giacomo Puccini used an extract of the melody in writing the aria \\"Dovunque al mondo...\\" in 1904 for his work Madama Butterfly.\\r\\nThe song gained popularity throughout the 19th century and bands played it during public events, such as July 4th celebrations.\\r\\nA plaque displayed at Fort Meade, South Dakota, claims that the idea of making \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" the national anthem began on their parade ground in 1892. Colonel Caleb Carlton, Post Commander, established the tradition that the song be played \\"at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts.\\" Carlton explained the custom to Governor Sheldon of South Dakota who \\"promised me that he would try to have the custom established among the state militia.\\" Carlton wrote that after a similar discussion, Secretary of War, Daniel E. Lamont issued an order that it \\"be played at every Army post every evening at retreat.\\" [15]\\r\\nIn 1899, the US Navy official adopted \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\".[16] In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" be played at military[16] and other appropriate occasions. The playing of the song two years later during the seventh-inning stretch of Game One of the 1918 World Series, and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited as the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game,[17] though evidence shows that the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" was performed as early as 1897 at opening day ceremonies in Philadelphia and then more regularly at the Polo Grounds in New York City beginning in 1898. In any case, the tradition of performing the national anthem before every baseball game began in World War II.[18]\\r\\nOn April 10, 1918, John Charles Linthicum, U.S. Congressman from Maryland, introduced a bill to officially recognize \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as the national anthem.[19] The bill did not pass.[19] On April 15, 1929, Linthicum introduced the bill again, his sixth time doing so.[19] On November 3, 1929, Robert Ripley drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon, Ripley's Believe it or Not!, saying \\"Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem\\".[20]\\r\\nIn 1930, Veterans of Foreign Wars started a petition for the United States to officially recognize \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as the national anthem.[21] Five million people signed the petition.[21] The petition was presented to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on January 31, 1930.[22] On the same day, Elsie Jorss-Reilley and Grace Evelyn Boudlin sang the song to the Committee to refute the perception that it was too high pitched for a typical person to sing.[23] The Committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor for a vote.[24] The House of Representatives passed the bill later that year.[25] The Senate passed the bill on March 3, 1931.[25] President Herbert Hoover signed the bill on March 4, 1931, officially adopting \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as the national anthem of the United States of America.[1] As currently codified, the United States Code states that \\"[t]he composition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem.\\"[26]\\r\\nO say can you see, by the dawn's early light,\\r\\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,\\r\\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,\\r\\nO'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\\r\\nAnd the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\\r\\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\\r\\nO say does that star-spangled banner yet wave\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,\\r\\nWhere the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,\\r\\nWhat is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,\\r\\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\\r\\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,\\r\\nIn full glory reflected now shines in the stream:\\r\\n'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore\\r\\nThat the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,\\r\\nA home and a country, should leave us no more?\\r\\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.\\r\\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\\r\\nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:\\r\\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\\r\\n\\r\\nO thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\\r\\nBetween their loved homes and the war's desolation.\\r\\nBlest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land\\r\\nPraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!\\r\\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\\r\\nAnd this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'\\r\\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave![27]\\r\\nIn indignation over the start of the American Civil War, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.[28] added a fifth stanza to the song in 1861, which appeared in songbooks of the era.[29]\\r\\nWhen our land is illumined with Liberty's smile,\\r\\nIf a foe from within strike a blow at her glory,\\r\\nDown, down with the traitor that dares to defile\\r\\nThe flag of her stars and the page of her story!\\r\\nBy the millions unchained who our birthright have gained,\\r\\nWe will keep her bright blazon forever unstained!\\r\\nAnd the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave\\r\\nWhile the land of the free is the home of the brave.\\r\\nIn a version hand-written by Francis Scott Key in 1840, the third line reads \\"Whose bright stars and broad stripes, through the clouds of the fight\\".[30]\\r\\nThe song is notoriously difficult for nonprofessionals to sing because of its wide range?ÿ a 12th. Humorist Richard Armour referred to the song's difficulty in his book It All Started With Columbus.\\r\\nIn an attempt to take Baltimore, the British attacked Fort McHenry, which protected the harbor. Bombs were soon bursting in air, rockets were glaring, and all in all it was a moment of great historical interest. During the bombardment, a young lawyer named Francis Off Key [sic] wrote \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", and when, by the dawn's early light, the British heard it sung, they fled in terror.\\r\\nProfessional and amateur singers have been known to forget the words, which is one reason the song is sometimes pre-recorded and lip-synced.[citation needed] Other times the issue is avoided by having the performer(s) play the anthem instrumentally instead of singing it. The pre-recording of the anthem has become standard practice at some ballparks, such as Boston's Fenway Park, according to the SABR publication The Fenway Project.[31]\\r\\n\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" is traditionally played at the beginning of public sports events and orchestral concerts in the United States, as well as other public gatherings. The National Hockey League and Major League Soccer both require venues in both the U.S. and Canada to perform both the Canadian and American national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries (with the \\"away\\" anthem being performed first) .[32][better?source?needed] It is also usual for both American and Canadian anthems (done in the same way as the NHL and MLS) to be played at Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the Toronto Raptors (respectively), the only Canadian teams in those two major U.S. sports leagues, and in All Star Games on the MLB, NBA, and NHL. The Buffalo Sabres of the NHL, which play in a city on the CanadaÿUS border and have a substantial Canadian fan base, play both anthems before all home games regardless of where the visiting team is based.[33]\\r\\nTwo especially unusual performances of the song took place in the immediate aftermath of the United States September 11 attacks. On September 12, 2001, the Queen broke with tradition and allowed the Band of the Coldstream Guards to perform the anthem at Buckingham Palace, London, at the ceremonial Changing of the Guard, as a gesture of support for Britain's ally.[34] The following day at a St. Paul's Cathedral memorial service, the Queen joined in the singing of the anthem, an unprecedented occurrence.[35]\\r\\nThe 200th anniversary of the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" occurred in 2014 with various special events occurring throughout the United States. A particularly significant celebration occurred during the week of September 10ÿ16 in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Highlights included playing of a new arrangement of the anthem arranged by John Williams and participation of President Obama on Defender's Day, September 12, 2014, at Fort McHenry.[36] In addition, the anthem bicentennial included a youth music celebration[37] including the presentation of the National Anthem Bicentennial Youth Challenge winning composition written by Noah Altshuler.\\r\\nThe first popular music performance of the anthem heard by the mainstream U.S. was by Puerto Rican singer and guitarist Jos Feliciano. He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow, blues-style rendition of the song[38] at Tiger Stadium in Detroit before game five of the 1968 World Series, between Detroit and St. Louis.[39] This rendition started contemporary \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" controversies. The response from many in the Vietnam War-era U.S. was generally negative. Despite the controversy, Feliciano's performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" heard in the years since.[40] One week after Feliciano's performance, the anthem was in the news again when American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted controversial raised fists at the 1968 Olympics while the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" played at a medal ceremony.\\r\\nMarvin Gaye gave a soul-influenced performance at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game and Whitney Houston gave a soulful rendition before Super Bowl XXV in 1991, which was released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in 2001 (along with Jos Feliciano, the only times the anthem has been on the Billboard Hot 100). In 1993, Kiss did an instrumental rock version as the closing track on their album, Alive III. Another famous instrumental interpretation is Jimi Hendrix's version, which was a set-list staple from autumn 1968 until his death in September 1970, including a famous rendition at the Woodstock music festival in 1969. Incorporating sonic effects to emphasize the \\"rockets' red glare\\", and \\"bombs bursting in air\\", it became a late-1960s emblem. Roseanne Barr gave a controversial performance of the anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. The comedian belted out a screechy rendition of the song, and afterward she attempted a gesture of ball players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. The performance offended some, including the sitting U.S. President, George H. W. Bush.[41] Sufjan Stevens has frequently performed the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" in live sets, replacing the optimism in the end of the first verse with a new coda that alludes to the divisive state of the nation today. David Lee Roth both referenced parts of the anthem and played part of a hard rock rendition of the anthem on his song, \\"Yankee Rose\\" on his 1986 solo album, Eat 'Em and Smile. Steven Tyler also caused some controversy in 2001 (at the Indianapolis 500, to which he later issued a public apology) and again in 2012 (at the AFC Championship Game) with a cappella renditions of the song with changed lyrics.[42] A version of Aerosmith's Joe Perry and Brad Whitford playing part of the song can be heard at the end of their version of \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" on the Rockin' the Joint album. The band Boston gave an instrumental rock rendition of the anthem on their Greatest Hits album. The band Crush 40 made a version of the song as opening track from the album Thrill of the Feel (2000).\\r\\nIn March 2005, a government-sponsored program, the National Anthem Project, was launched after a Harris Interactive poll showed many adults knew neither the lyrics nor the history of the anthem.[43]\\r\\nSeveral films have their titles taken from the song's lyrics. These include two films titled Dawn's Early Light (2000[44] and 2005);[45] two made-for-TV features titled By Dawn's Early Light (1990[46] and 2000);[47] two films titled So Proudly We Hail (1943[48] and 1990);[49] a feature (1977)[50] and a short (2005)[51] titled Twilight's Last Gleaming; and four films titled Home of the Brave (1949,[52] 1986,[53] 2004,[54] and 2006).[55]\\r\\nWhen the National Anthem was first recognized by law in 1932, there was no proscription as to behavior during its playing. On June 22, 1942, the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing, while others should simply stand at attention, men removing their hats. (The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem, but not if the flag was not present.) On December 23, 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in uniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men removing their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions, but differentiating between \\"those in uniform\\" and \\"members of the Armed Forces and veterans\\" who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem, throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem, and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart. After 9/11, the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the Anthem became nearly universal. [56][57][58]\\r\\nSince 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code 36 U.S.C.??301) states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present including those in uniform should stand at attention; Non-military service individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart; Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute; Military service persons not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since allows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.[59][60]\\r\\nHowever, this statutory suggestion does not have any penalty associated with violations. 36 U.S.C.??301 This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance.[61] For example, Jehovah's Witnesses do not sing the national anthem, though they are taught that standing is an \\"ethical decision\\" that individual believers must make based on their \\"conscience.\\"[62][63][64]\\r\\nThe 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City. After having won gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200 meter running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". Each athlete raised a black-gloved fist, and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, Silent Gesture, Smith stated that the gesture was not a \\"Black Power\\" salute, but a \\"human rights salute\\". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern Olympic Games.[65]\\r\\nPolitically motivated protests of the national anthem began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback (QB) Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.[66]\\r\\nAs a result of immigration to the United States and the incorporation of non-English speaking people into the country, the lyrics of the song have been translated into other languages. In 1861, it was translated into German.[67] The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish-language version from 1919.[68] It has since been translated into Hebrew[69] and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants,[70] Latin American Spanish (with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006),[71] French by Acadians of Louisiana,[72] Samoan,[73] and Irish.[74] The third verse of the anthem has also been translated into Latin.[75]\\r\\nWith regard to the indigenous languages of North America, there are versions in Navajo[76][77][78] and Cherokee.[79]","input":"When was the national anthem of america written?"},{"output":"10 December","context":"The Nobel Prize (/?no?b?l/, Swedish pronunciation:?[n??b?l]; Swedish definite form, singular: Nobelpriset; Norwegian: Nobelprisen) is a set of five annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances.\\r\\nThe will of the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[3][4][5] In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, which has been commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics.[6][7][8] The Nobel Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature, medicine, physics, chemistry, economics and activism for peace.[9][10][11]\\r\\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel; the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature; and the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded not by a Swedish organization but by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\\r\\nBetween 1901 and 2017, the Nobel Prizes including the Economic Prizes were awarded 585 times to 923 people and organizations.[4] With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 24 organizations, and 892 individuals.[4][12] The prize ceremonies take place annually in Stockholm, Sweden (with the exception of the peace prize, which is held in Oslo, Norway). Each recipient, or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money that has been decided by the Nobel Foundation. (As of 2017[update], each prize is worth SEK 9,000,000 or about US$1,110,000, ?944,000, S836,000 or INR 72,693,900)[1] Medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold, and later in 18 carat green gold plated with a 24 carat gold coating.\\r\\nThe prize is not awarded posthumously; however, if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it, the prize may still be presented.[13] Though the average number of laureates per prize increased substantially during the 20th century, a prize may not be shared among more than three people, although the Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded to organizations of more than three people.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlfred Nobel (?listen?(help{info)) was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers.[15] He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth from his 355?inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.[16]\\r\\nIn 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary, titled The merchant of death is dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will.[17] On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.[18]\\r\\nNobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died, signing it at the SwedishÿNorwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[19][20] To widespread astonishment, Nobel's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \\"greatest benefit on mankind\\" in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace.[21] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31?million SEK (c. US$186 million, ?150 million in 2008), to establish the five Nobel Prizes.[22][23] Because of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway.[24] The executors of Nobel's will, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organised the award of prizes.[25]\\r\\nNobel's instructions named a Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize, the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize-awarding organizations were designated or established. These were Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[26] The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[21] In 1905, the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved.\\r\\nIn the 19th century the Nobel family who were known for their innovations to the oil industry in Azerbaijan was the leading representative of foreign capital in Baku. Robert Nobel was the first foreign investor in oil sector in Baku. In 1875 R. Nobel bought a small refinery to Baku, thus the foundation of The Nobel Brothers Company that was nationalized by the Baku Council of People's Commissars the Company in 1918 was laid.[27]\\r\\nIn 1920 the Company was nationalized by the government of Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Even the Nobel Brothers Petroleum Company\`s symbol was created by taking inspiration from the Fire Temple (Ateshgah) in Surakhani and their oil tankers were given some religious and philosophical names such as Zoroaster, Muhammad, Buddha, Brahma, Socrates, Spinoza and Darwin.\\r\\nAccording to the Alfred Nobel's will and testament read in Stockholm on 30th December 1896, a foundation established by Alfred Nobel would reward those who serve humanity.\\r\\nThe Nobel Prize was funded by Alfred Nobels personal fortune. According to the official sources, Alfred Nobel bequeathed from the shares 94% of his fortune to the Nobel Foundation that now forms the economic base of the Nobel Prize. [28]\\r\\nThe Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organization on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes.[29] In accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. Robert and Ludvig Nobel were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan, and according to Swedish historian E. Bargengren, who accessed the Nobel family archives, it was this \\"decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established\\".[30] Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates.[31][32] In many ways, the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company, in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953).[33] Since the 1980s, the Foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007, the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628 billion Swedish kronor (c. US$560 million).[34]\\r\\nAccording to the statutes, the Foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council, with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members, a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council, and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees, and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of these institutions, and auditors.[34]\\r\\nOnce the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place, the Nobel Committees began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes. Subsequently, they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions.\\r\\nThe Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited Wilhelm R?ntgen's discovery of X-rays and Philipp Lenard's work on cathode rays. The Academy of Sciences selected R?ntgen for the prize.[35][36] In the last decades of the 19th century, many chemists had made significant contributions. Thus, with the Chemistry Prize, the Academy \\"was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize.\\"[37] The Academy received 20 nominations, eleven of them for Jacobus van 't Hoff.[38] Van 't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in chemical thermodynamics.[39][40]\\r\\nThe Swedish Academy chose the poet Sully Prudhomme for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. A group including 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded.[41] Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation is that most of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet.[42] The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.[43][44]\\r\\nThe first Nobel Peace Prize went to the Swiss Jean Henri Dunant for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention, and jointly given to French pacifist Frdric Passy, founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization.\\r\\nIn 1938 and 1939, Adolf Hitler's Third Reich forbade three laureates from Germany (Richard Kuhn, Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt, and Gerhard Domagk) from accepting their prizes.[45] Each man was later able to receive the diploma and medal.[46] Even though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War, the prizes were awarded irregularly. In 1939, the Peace Prize was not awarded. No prize was awarded in any category from 1940ÿ42, due to the occupation of Norway by Germany. In the subsequent year, all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace.[47]\\r\\nDuring the occupation of Norway, three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden.[48] These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.[45]\\r\\nIn 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish National Bank) celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honor of Nobel. The following year, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates. The first laureates for the Economics Prize were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch \\"for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes.\\"[49][50] The Board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition, it would allow no further new prizes.[51]\\r\\nThe award process is similar for all of the Nobel Prizes; the main difference is in who can make nominations for each of them.[52]\\r\\nNomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3,000 individuals, usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.[52][53] The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.[54] The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.[55][56]\\r\\nThe Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions.[57] The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote.[58] A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.[59]\\r\\nAlthough posthumous nominations are not presently permitted, individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to Erik Axel Karlfeldt, and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj?ld. Since 1974, laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. There has been one laureate, William Vickrey, who in 1996 died after the prize (in Economics) was announced but before it could be presented.[60] On 3 October 2011, the laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were announced; however, the committee was not aware that one of the laureates, Ralph M. Steinman, had died three days earlier. The committee was debating about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.[13] The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize \\"was made in good faith\\", it would remain unchanged.[61]\\r\\nNobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made \\"during the preceding year\\". Early on, the awards usually recognised recent discoveries.[62] However, some of those early discoveries were later discredited. For example, Johannes Fibiger was awarded the 1926 Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer.[63] To avoid repeating this embarrassment, the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time.[64][65][66] According to Ralf Pettersson, former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine, \\"the criterion 'the previous year' is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident.\\"[65]\\r\\nThe interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement.[67][68] The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts.[69][70] However, they can also be awarded for specific recent events.[71] For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.[72] Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.[73]\\r\\nAwards for physics, chemistry, and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted. Sometimes, this takes decades ÿ for example, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution.[74][75] Not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised. Some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died.[76][77][78]\\r\\nExcept for the Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo, Norway, usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events.[79][80] The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies' are held at the Stockholm Concert Hall, with the Nobel banquet following immediately at Stockholm City Hall. The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905ÿ1946), at the auditorium of the University of Oslo (1947ÿ1989), and at Oslo City Hall (1990ÿpresent).[81]\\r\\nThe highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden. In Oslo, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway.[80][82] At first, King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners. It is said that he changed his mind once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for Sweden.[83]\\r\\nAfter the award ceremony in Sweden, a banquet is held in the Blue Hall at the Stockholm City Hall, which is attended by the Swedish Royal Family and around 1,300 guests.\\r\\nThe Nobel Peace Prize banquet is held in Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel after the award ceremony. Apart from the laureate, guests include the President of the Storting, the Prime Minister, and, since 2006, the King and Queen of Norway. In total, about 250 guests attend.\\r\\nAccording to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize.[84] The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format.[85] These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office.[86] The lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates.[87]\\r\\nIt was announced on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the contract for the production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket, Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation.[88] Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal.[89] The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.[90]\\r\\nAll medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold. Since then, they have been struck in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold, but averages about 175 grams (0.386?lb) for each medal. The diameter is 66 millimetres (2.6?in) and the thickness varies between 5.2 millimetres (0.20?in) and 2.4 millimetres (0.094?in).[91] Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display, Nobel medals are subject to medal theft.[92][93][94] During World War II, the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark, Hungarian chemist (and Nobel laureate himself) George de Hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid), to prevent confiscation by Nazi Germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders. After the war, the gold was recovered from solution, and the medals re-cast.[95]\\r\\nNobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden, or in the case of the peace prize, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them.[89] The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.[96][97]\\r\\nThe laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes, in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded.[89] The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. The purse has increased since the 1980s, when the prize money was 880 000 SEK (c. 2.6 million SEK, US$350?000 today) per prize. In 2009, the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million).[98][99] In June 2012, it was lowered to 8 million SEK.[100] If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients. If there are three, the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally, or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others.[101][102][103] It is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific, cultural, or humanitarian causes.[104][105]\\r\\nAmong other criticisms, the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda, and of omitting more deserving candidates. They have also been accused of Eurocentrism, especially for the Literature Prize.[106][107][108]\\r\\nAmong the most criticised Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to Henry Kissinger and L ??c Th?. This led to the resignation of two Norwegian Nobel Committee members. [109] Kissinger and Th? were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between North Vietnam and the United States in January 1973. However, when the award was announced, both sides were still engaging in hostilities.[110] Critics sympathetic to the North announced that Kissinger was not a peace-maker but the opposite, responsible for widening the war. Those hostile to the North and what they considered its deceptive practices during negotiations were deprived of a chance to criticise L ??c Th?, as he declined the award. [55][111]\\r\\nYasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, and Yitzhak Rabin received the Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between Israel and Palestine.[55][112] Immediately after the award was announced, one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned.[113] Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers.[114]\\r\\nAnother controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to Barack Obama in 2009.[115] Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months.[116] Obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award,[117] or worthy of the company it would place him in.[118] Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.[119]\\r\\nThe award of the 2004 Literature Prize to Elfriede Jelinek drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy, Knut Ahnlund. Ahnlund resigned, alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused \\"irreparable damage to all progressive forces, it has also confused the general view of literature as an art.\\" He alleged that Jelinek's works were \\"a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure.\\"[120][121] The 2009 Literature Prize to Herta Mller also generated criticism. According to The Washington Post, many US literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work.[122] This made those critics feel the prizes were too Eurocentric.[123]\\r\\nIn 1949, the neurologist Ant܇nio Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the prefrontal leucotomy. The previous year, Dr. Walter Freeman had developed a version of the procedure which was faster and easier to carry out. Due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure, Freeman's procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern medical ethics. Endorsed by such influential publications as The New England Journal of Medicine, leucotomy or \\"lobotomy\\" became so popular that about 5,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States in the three years immediately following Moniz's receipt of the Prize.[124][125]\\r\\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1937ÿ39, 1947, and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948.[126] Later, members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize.[127] Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006, said, \\"The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize. Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\\".[128] In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that \\"there was no suitable living candidate\\" that year.[127][129] Later, when the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \\"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.\\"[130] Other high-profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out. Foreign Policy lists Eleanor Roosevelt, Vclav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Sari Nusseibeh, and Corazon Aquino as people who \\"never won the prize, but should have.\\"[131]\\r\\nIn 1965, UN Secretary General U Thant was informed by the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept. He consulted staff and later replied that he would. At the same time, Chairman Gunnar Jahn of the Nobel Peace prize committee, lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to UNICEF. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant, for his work in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending the war in the Congo, and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant.[132][133]\\r\\nThe Literature Prize also has controversial omissions. Adam Kirsch has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons. The heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism.[134][135] The Eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by Peter Englund, the 2009 Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to European authors.[136] This tendency towards European authors still leaves some European writers on a list of notable writers that have been overlooked for the Literature Prize, including Europe's Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, J. R. R. Tolkien, mile Zola, Marcel Proust, Vladimir Nabokov, James Joyce, August Strindberg, Simon Vestdijk, Karel ?apek, the New World's Jorge Luis Borges, Ezra Pound, John Updike, Arthur Miller, Mark Twain, and Africa's Chinua Achebe.[137]\\r\\nCandidates can receive multiple nominations the same year. Gaston Ramon received a total of 155[138] nominations in physiology or medicine from 1930 to 1953, the last year with public nomination data for that award as of 2016[update]. He died in 1963 without being awarded. Pierre Paul mile Roux received 115[139] nominations in physiology or medicine, and Arnold Sommerfeld received 84[140] in physics. These are the three most nominated scientists without awards in the data published as of 2016[update].[141] Otto Stern received 79[142] nominations in physics 1925ÿ43 before being awarded in 1943.[143]\\r\\nThe strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial.[144] When a prize is awarded to recognise an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators, one or more will miss out. For example, in 2002, the prize was awarded to Koichi Tanaka and John Fenn for the development of mass spectrometry in protein chemistry, an award that did not recognise the achievements of Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Frankfurt.[145][146] According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics, the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013: the team of Carl Hagen, Gerald Guralnik, and Tom Kibble published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the cosmos began, but did not share the 2013 Physics Prize awarded to Peter Higgs and Fran?ois Englert, who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject. All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion, albeit from different angles. Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction, or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years.[147]\\r\\nSimilarly, the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded. The Economics Prize was not awarded to Fischer Black, who died in 1995, when his co-author Myron Scholes received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with Robert C. Merton, another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. In the announcement of the award that year, the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role.\\r\\nPolitical subterfuge may also deny proper recognition. Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann, who co-discovered nuclear fission along with Otto Hahn, may have been denied a share of Hahn's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the Nazis came to power.[148] The Meitner and Strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognised until years later, when they joined Hahn in receiving the 1966 Enrico Fermi Award.\\r\\nAlfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded \\"to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.\\"[149] He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given \\"to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics.\\" Nobel did not emphasise discoveries, but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions: 77% of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23% to inventions. Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg, in papers published in Nature and Technoetic Arts, have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society.[150][151]\\r\\nIn terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, only a small proportion have been awarded to women. Out of 199 laureates in Physics, 169 in Chemistry and 207 in Medicine, there were only two female laureates in physics, four in chemistry and 11 in medicine between 1901 and 2014.[152][153]\\r\\nFour people have received two Nobel Prizes. Marie Curie received the Physics Prize in 1903 for her work on radioactivity and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium,[154] making her the only person to be awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. Linus Pauling was awarded the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances. Pauling was also awarded the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons, making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes. John Bardeen received the Physics Prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity.[155] Frederick Sanger received the prize twice in Chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA.[156][157]\\r\\nTwo organizations have received the Peace Prize multiple times. The International Committee of the Red Cross received it three times: in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars; and in 1963 during the year of its centenary.[158][159][160] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been awarded the Peace Prize twice for assisting refugees: in 1954 and 1981.[161]\\r\\nThe Curie family has received the most prizes, with four prizes awarded to five individual laureates. Marie Curie received the prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). Her husband, Pierre Curie, shared the 1903 Physics prize with her.[162] Their daughter, Irne Joliot-Curie, received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband Frdric Joliot-Curie. In addition, the husband of Marie Curie's second daughter, Henry Labouisse, was the director of UNICEF when it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965.[163]\\r\\nAlthough no family matches the Curie family's record, there have been several with two laureates. The husband-and-wife team of Gerty Cori and Carl Ferdinand Cori shared the 1947 Prize in Physiology or Medicine[164] as did the husband-and-wife team of May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser in 2014 (along with John O'Keefe).[165] J. J. Thomson was awarded the Physics Prize in 1906 for showing that electrons are particles. His son, George Paget Thomson, received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves.[166] William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, shared the Physics Prize in 1915 for inventing the X-ray spectrometer.[167] Niels Bohr was awarded the Physics prize in 1922, as did his son, Aage Bohr, in 1975.[163][168] Manne Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1924, was the father of Kai Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1981.[163][169] Hans von Euler-Chelpin, who received the Chemistry Prize in 1929, was the father of Ulf von Euler, who was awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1970.[163] C. V. Raman was awarded the Physics Prize in 1930 and was the uncle of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who was awarded the same prize in 1983.[170][171] Arthur Kornberg received the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1959; Kornberg's son, Roger later received the Chemistry Prize in 2006.[172] Jan Tinbergen, who was awarded the first Economics Prize in 1969, was the brother of Nikolaas Tinbergen, who received the 1973 Physiology or Medicine Prize.[163] Alva Myrdal, Peace Prize laureate in 1982, was the wife of Gunnar Myrdal who was awarded the Economics Prize in 1974.[163] Economics laureates Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow were brothers-in-law. Frits Zernike, who was awarded the 1953 Physics Prize, is the great-uncle of 1999 Physics laureate Gerard 't Hooft.[173]\\r\\nBeing a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that's recognisable worldwide, the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction. This includes films like The Prize and Nobel Son about fictional Nobel laureates as well as fictionalised accounts of stories surrounding real prizes such as Nobel Chor, a film based on the unsolved theft of Rabindranath Tagore's prize.[174]\\r\\nTwo laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Literature Prize but refused, stating, \\"A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honourable form.\\"[175] L ??c Th?, chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the Paris Peace Accords, declined, stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam.[176]\\r\\nDuring the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler hindered Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt, and Gerhard Domagk from accepting their prizes. All of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II. In 1958, Boris Pasternak declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return, the Swedish Academy refused his refusal, saying \\"this refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award.\\"[176] The Academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year, holding it until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf.[177][178] Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in Burma; Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later, in 2012.[179] Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in China as political prisoners, and he was unable to accept the prize in his lifetime.\\r\\nThe memorial symbol \\"Planet of Alfred Nobel\\" was opened in Dnipropetrovsk University of Economics and Law in 2008. On the globe, there are 802 Nobel laureates' reliefs made of a composite alloy obtained when disposing of military strategic missiles.[180][181]\\r\\n?This article incorporates text from a free content work.

The deity Osiris was believed to be the lord of the underworld since he personified rebirth and life after death, being the first mummy as depicted in the Osiris myth. The underworld was also the residence of various other gods along with Osiris. The Duat was the region through which the sun god Ra traveled from west to east each night, and it was where he battled Apep, who embodied the primordial chaos which the sun had to defeat in order to rise each morning and bring order back to the earth. It was also the place where people's souls went after death for judgement, though that was not the full extent of the afterlife.[1] Burial chambers formed touching-points between the mundane world and the Duat, and the akh, the effectiveness of the dead, could use tombs to travel back and forth from the Duat.[2]\\r\\nEach night through the Duat the sun god Ra travelled, signifying revivification as the main goal of the dead. Ra travelled under the world upon his Atet barge from west to east, and was transformed from its aged Atum form into Khepri, the new dawning sun. The dead king, worshiped as a god, was also central to the mythology surrounding the concept of Duat, often depicted as being one with Ra.[3] Along with the sun god the dead king had to travel through the Kingdom of Osiris, the Duat, using the special knowledge he was supposed to possess, which was recorded in the Coffin Texts, that served as a guide to the hereafter not just for the king but for all deceased. According to the Amduat, the underworld consists of twelve regions signifying the twelve hours of the sun god's journey through it, battling Apep in order to bring order back to the earth in the morning; as his rays illuminated the Duat throughout the journey, they revived the dead who occupied the underworld and let them enjoy life after death in that hour of the night when they were in the presence of the sun god, after which they went back to their sleep waiting for the gods return the following night.[4]\\r\\nJust like the dead king, the rest of the dead journeyed through the various parts of the Duat, not to be unified with the sun god but to be judged. If the deceased was successfully able to pass various demons and challenges, then he or she would reach the weighing of the heart. In this ritual, the heart of the deceased was weighed by Anubis against the feather of Ma'at, which represents truth and justice. Any heart that is heavier than the feather was rejected and eaten by Ammit- the devourer of souls, as these people were denied existence after death in the Duat. The souls that were lighter than the feather would pass this most important test, and would be allowed to travel toward Aaru- the field of reeds, an ideal version of the world they knew of, in which they would plough, sow, and harvest abundant crops.[5]\\r\\nWhat is known of the Duat derives principally from funerary texts such as the Book of Gates, the Book of Caverns, the Coffin Texts, the Amduat, and the Book of the Dead. Each of these documents fulfilled a different purpose and give a different conception of the Duat, and different texts could be inconsistent with one another. This did not have mean, in the Egyptian understanding, that one who believed in one interpertation should have denied the other, as there was an understanding of multiplicity of approaches. Surviving texts differ in age and origin, and there likely was never a single uniform conception of the Duat, as is the case of many theological concepts in Ancient Egypt.[6]\\r\\nThe geography of Duat is similar in outline to the world the Egyptians knew. There are realistic features like rivers, islands, fields, lakes, mounds and caverns, however, there were also fantastic lakes of fire, walls of iron and trees of turquoise. In the Book of Two Ways, one of the Coffin Texts, there is even a map-like image of the Duat.[7] The Book of the Dead and Coffin Texts were intended to guide people who had recently died through the Duat's dangerous landscape and to a life as an akh or an effective spirit in the netherworld. Emphasized in some these texts are mounds and caverns, inhabited by gods, demons or supernatural animals, which threatened the deceased along their journey. The purpose of the books is not to lay out a geography, but to describe a succession of rites of passage which the dead would have to pass to reach eternal life.[8]\\r\\nIn spite of the many demon-like inhabitants of the Duat, it is not equivalent to the Abrahamic conceptions of Hell in which souls are condemned with fiery torment; the absolute punishment for the wicked, in Ancient Egyptian thought, was the denial of an afterlife to the deceased, ceasing to exist in akh form. The grotesque spirits of the underworld were not evil, but under the control of the gods, being present as various ordeals that the deceased had to face.[9] The Duat was also a residence for various gods, including Osiris, Anubis, Thoth, Horus, Hathor, and Ma'at, who all appear to the dead soul as it makes its way toward judgement.","input":"What was the egyptian guide to the afterlife called?"},{"output":"In humans, this enzyme is expressed both in the liver and the kidney","context":"1DMW, 1J8T, 1J8U, 1KW0, 1LRM, 1MMK, 1MMT, 1TDW, 1TG2, 2PAH, 3PAH, 4ANP, 5PAH, 6PAH, 5FII\\r\\n5053\\r\\n18478\\r\\nENSG00000171759\\r\\nENSMUSG00000020051\\r\\nP00439\\r\\nP16331\\r\\nNM_000277\\r\\nNM_001354304\\r\\nNM_008777\\r\\nNP_000268\\r\\nNP_001341233\\r\\nNP_032803\\r\\nPhenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) (EC 1.14.16.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the aromatic side-chain of phenylalanine to generate tyrosine. PAH is one of three members of the biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, a class of monooxygenase that uses tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, a pteridine cofactor) and a non-heme iron for catalysis. During the reaction, molecular oxygen is heterolytically cleaved with sequential incorporation of one oxygen atom into BH4 and phenylalanine substrate.[5]\\r\\nPhenylalanine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme of the metabolic pathway that degrades excess phenylalanine. Research on phenylalanine hydroxylase by Seymour Kaufman led to the discovery of tetrahydrobiopterin as a biological cofactor.[6] The enzyme is also interesting from a human health perspective because mutations in PAH, the encoding gene, can lead to phenylketonuria, a severe metabolic disorder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reaction is thought to proceed through the following steps:\\r\\nFormation and cleavage of the iron-peroxypterin bridge. Although evidence strongly supports Fe(IV)=O as the hydroxylating intermediate,[8] the mechanistic details underlying the formation of the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge prior to heterolytic cleavage remain controversial. Two pathways have been proposed based on models that differ in the proximity of the iron to the pterin cofactor and the number of water molecules assumed to be iron-coordinated during catalysis. According to one model, an iron dioxygen complex is initially formed and stabilized as a resonance hybrid of Fe2+O2 and Fe3+O2?. The activated O2 then attacks BH4, forming a transition state characterized by charge separation between the electron-deficient pterin ring and the electron-rich dioxygen species.[9] The Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is subsequently formed. On the other hand, formation of this bridge has been modeled assuming that BH4 is located in iron's first coordination shell and that the iron is not coordinated to any water molecules. This model predicts a different mechanism involving a pterin radical and superoxide as critical intermediates.[10] Once formed, the Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is broken through heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond to Fe(IV)=O and 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin; thus, molecular oxygen is the source of both oxygen atoms used to hydroxylate the pterin ring and phenylalanine.\\r\\nHydroxylation of phenylalanine by ferryl oxo intermediate. Because the mechanism involves a Fe(IV)=O (as opposed to a peroxypterin) hydroxylating intermediate, oxidation of the BH4 cofactor and hydroxylation of phenylalanine can be decoupled, resulting in unproductive consumption of BH4 and formation of H2O2.[7] When productive, though, the Fe(IV)=O intermediate is added to phenylalanine in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction that reduces iron from the ferryl to the ferrous state.[7] Although initially an arene oxide or radical intermediate was proposed, analyses of the related tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylases have suggested that the reaction instead proceeds through a cationic intermediate that requires Fe(IV)=O to be coordinated to a water ligand rather than a hydroxo group.[7][11] This cationic intermediate subsequently undergoes a 1,2-hydride NIH shift, yielding a dienone intermediate that then tautomerizes to form the tyrosine product.[12] The pterin cofactor is regenerated by hydration of the carbinolamine product of PAH to quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2), which is then reduced to BH4.[13]\\r\\nPAH is proposed to use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.[14][15]\\r\\nMammalian PAH exists in an equilibrium consisting of tetramers of two distinct architectures, with one or more dimeric forms as part of the equilibrium. This behavior is consistent with a dissociative allosteric mechanism.[15]\\r\\nMany studies suggest that mammalian PAH shows behavior comparable to porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS), wherein a variety of factors such as pH and ligand binding are reported to affect enzyme activity and protein stability.[15]\\r\\nThe PAH monomer (51.9 kDa) consists of three distinct domains: a regulatory N-terminal domain (residues 1-117), the catalytic domain (residues 118-427), and a C-terminal domain (residues 428-453) responsible for oligomerization of identical monomers. Extensive crystallographic analysis has been performed, especially on the pterin- and iron-coordinated catalytic domain to examine the active site. The structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain has also been determined, and together with the solved structure of the homologous tyrosine hydroxylase C-terminal tetramerization domain, a structural model of tetrameric PAH has been proposed.[13]\\r\\nSolved crystal structures of the catalytic domain indicate that the active site consists of an open and spacious pocket lined primarily by hydrophobic residues, though three glutamic acid residues, two histidines, and a tyrosine are also present and iron-binding.[13] Contradictory evidence exists about the coordination state of the ferrous atom and its proximity to BH4 within the active site. According to crystallographic analysis, Fe(II) is coordinated by water, His285, His290, and Glu330 (a 2-his-1-carboxylate facial triad arrangement) with octahedral geometry.[16] Inclusion of a Phe analogue in the crystal structure changes both iron from a six- to a five-coordinated state involving a single water molecule and bidentate coordination to Glu330 and opening a site for oxygen to bind. BH4 is concommitantly shifted toward the iron atom, although the pterin cofactor remains in the second coordination sphere.[17] On the other hand, a competing model based on NMR and molecular modeling analyses suggests that all coordinated water molecules are forced out of the active site during the catalytic cycle while BH4 becomes directly coordinated to iron.[18] As discussed above, resolving this discrepancy will be important for determining the exact mechanism of PAH catalysis.\\r\\nThe regulatory nature of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-117) is conferred by its structural flexibility.[19] Hydrogen/deuterium exchanges analysis indicates that allosteric binding of Phe globally alters the conformation of PAH such that the active site is less occluded as the interface between the regulatory and catalytic domains is increasingly exposed to solvent.[19][20][21] This observation is consistent with kinetic studies, which show an initially low rate of tyrosine formation for full-length PAH. This lag time is not observed, however, for a truncated PAH lacking the N-terminal domain or if the full-length enzyme is pre-incubated with Phe. Deletion of the N-terminal domain also eliminates the lag time while increasing the affinity for Phe by nearly two-fold; no difference is observed in the Vmax or Km for the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor.[22] Additional regulation is provided by Ser16; phosphorylation of this residue does not alter enzyme conformation but does reduce the concentration of Phe required for allosteric activation.[21] This N-terminal regulatory domain is not observed in bacterial PAHs but shows considerable structural homology to the regulatory domain of phosphogylcerate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the serine biosynthetic pathway.[21]\\r\\nProkaryotic PAH is monomeric, whereas eukaryotic PAH exists in an equilibrium between homotetrameric and homodimeric forms.[7][13] The dimerization interface is composed of symmetry-related loops that link identical monomers, while the overlapping C-terminal tetramerization domain mediates the association of conformationally distinct dimers that are characterized by a different relative orientation of the catalytic and tetramerization domains (Flatmark, Erlandsen). The resulting distortion of the tetramer symmetry is evident in the differential surface area of the dimerization interfaces and distinguishes PAH from the tetramerically symmetrical tyrosine hydroxylase.[13] A domain-swapping mechanism has been proposed to mediate formation of the tetramer from dimers, in which C-terminal alpha-helixes mutually alter their conformation around a flexible C-terminal five-residue hinge region to form a coiled-coil structure, shifting equilibrium toward the tetrameric form.[7][13][23] Although both the homodimeric and homotetrameric forms of PAH are catalytically active, the two exhibit differential kinetics and regulation. In addition to reduced catalytic efficiency, the dimer does not display positive cooperativity toward L-Phe (which at high concentrations activates the enzyme), suggesting that L-Phe allosterically regulates PAH by influencing dimer-dimer interaction.[23]\\r\\nPAH is a critical enzyme in phenylalanine metabolism and catalyzes the rate-limiting step in its complete catabolism to carbon dioxide and water.[13][24] Regulation of flux through phenylalanine-associated pathways is critical in mammalian metabolism, as evidenced by the toxicity of high plasma levels of this amino acid observed in phenylketonuria (see below). The principal source of phenylalanine is ingested proteins, but relatively little of this pool is used for protein synthesis.[24] Instead, the majority of ingested phenylalanine is catabolized through PAH to form tyrosine; addition of the hydroxyl group allows for the benzene ring to be broken in subsequent catabolic steps. Transamination to phenylpyruvate, whose metabolites are excreted in the urine, represents another pathway of phenylalanine turnover, but catabolism through PAH predominates.[24]\\r\\nIn humans, this enzyme is expressed both in the liver and the kidney, and there is some indication that it may be differentially regulated in these tissues.[25] PAH is unusual among the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases for its involvement in catabolism; tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, on the other hand, are primarily expressed in the central nervous system and catalyze rate-limiting steps in neurotransmitter/hormone biosynthesis.[13]\\r\\nDeficiency in PAH activity due to mutations in the PAH gene causes hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and when blood phenylalanine levels increase above 20 times the normal concentration, the metabolic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) results.[24] PKU is both genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous: Over 300 distinct pathological mutants have been identified, the majority of which correspond to missense mutations that map to the catalytic domain.[13][16] When a cohort of identified PAH mutants were expressed in recombinant systems, the enzymes displayed altered kinetic behavior and/or reduced stability, consistent with structural mapping of these mutations to both the catalytic and tetramerization domains of the enzyme.[13] BH44 has been administered as a pharmacological treatment and has been shown to reduce blood levels of phenylalanine for a segment of PKU patients whose genotypes lead to some residual PAH activity but have no defect in BH44 synthesis or regeneration. Follow-up studies suggest that in the case of certain PAH mutants, excess BH44 acts as a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize mutant enzymes with disrupted tetramer assembly and increased sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage and aggregation.[26] Mutations that have been identified in the PAH locus are documented at the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Locus Knowledgbase (PAHdb, http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca/).\\r\\nSince phenylketonuria can cause irreversible damage, it is imperative that deficiencies in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase are determined early on in development. One method is a post-parturition screening test known as the Guthrie Test. The common method is via drawing blood from a small needle prick at the heel of the newborn and testing it for phenylketonurea, indicative of a PH deficiency. Placing the individual on a low phenylalanine, high tyrosine diet can help prevent any long-term damage to their development.\\r\\nPhenylalanine hydroxylase is closely related to two other enzymes:\\r\\nThe three enzymes are homologous, that is, are thought to have evolved from the same ancient hydroxylase.","input":"Where is phenylalanine hydroxylase found in the body?"},{"output":"James Madison","context":"The annual NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship tournament has determined the top women's lacrosse team in the NCAA Division I since 1982.\\r\\nJames Madison is the champion, having defeated Boston College in the 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship final.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLacrosse was one of twelve women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981-82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the AIAW for sole governance of women's collegiate sports.

The Act[2]\\r\\nAt the time, the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that about four million illegal immigrants would apply for legal status through the act and that roughly half of them would be eligible.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomano L. Mazzoli was a Democratic representative from Kentucky and Alan K. Simpson was a Republican senator from Wyoming who chaired their respective immigration subcommittees in Congress. Their effort was assisted by the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, then President of the University of Notre Dame.\\r\\nThe law criminalized the act of engaging in a \\"pattern or practice\\" of knowingly hiring an \\"unauthorized alien\\"[4] and established financial and other penalties for those employing illegal immigrants under the theory that low prospects for employment would reduce undocumented immigration. Regulations promulgated under the Act introduced the I-9 form to ensure that all employees presented documentary proof of their legal eligibility to accept employment in the United States.[5]\\r\\nThese sanctions would apply only to employers that had more than three employees and did not make a sufficient effort to determine the legal status of their workers.\\r\\nThe first SimpsonÿMazzoli Bill was reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The bill failed to be received by the House, but civil rights advocates were concerned over the potential for abuse and discrimination against Hispanics, growers' groups rallied for additional provisions for foreign labor, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce persistently opposed sanctions against employers.\\r\\nThe second SimpsonÿMazzoli Bill finally passed both chambers in 1985, but it came apart in the conference committee over the issue of cost. The year marked an important turning point for the reform effort. Employer opposition to employer sanctions began to subside, partly because of the \\"affirmative defense\\" clause in the law that explicitly released employers from any obligation to check the authenticity of workers' documents.\\r\\nAlso, agricultural employers shifted their focus from opposition to employer sanctions to a concerted campaign to secure alternative sources of foreign labor. As opposition to employer sanctions waned and growers' lobbying efforts for extensive temporary worker programs intensified, agricultural worker programs began to outrank employer sanctions component as the most controversial element of reform.\\r\\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act did not address the status of children of illegal aliens who were eligible for the amnesty program. In 1987 President Reagan used his executive authority to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul,[6] announcing a blanket deferral of deportation for children under 18 who were living in a two-parent household with both parents legalizing, or with a single parent who was legalizing.[7] This action affected an estimated 100,000 families.\\r\\nAccording to one study, the IRCA caused some employers to discriminate against workers who appeared foreign, resulting in a small reduction in overall Hispanic employment. There is no statistical evidence that a reduction in employment correlated to unemployment in the economy as a whole or was separate from the general unemployment population statistics.[8] Another study stated that if hired, wages were being lowered to compensate employers for the perceived risk of hiring foreigners.[9]\\r\\nThe hiring process also changed as employers turned to indirect hiring through subcontractors. \\"Under a subcontracting agreement, a U.S. citizen or resident alien contractually agrees with an employer to provide a specific number of workers for a certain period of time to undertake a defined task at a fixed rate of pay per worker\\".[9] \\"By using a subcontractor the firm is not held liable since the workers are not employees. The use of a subcontractor decreases a worker's wages since a portion is kept by the subcontractor. This indirect hiring is imposed on everyone regardless of legality\\".[9]\\r\\nThere have been various law changes over the years that encouraged immigrants to enter or exit the United States. With the railroad, World War II, and agricultural work force demands, many immigrants saw the opportunity to come to the United States temporarily for money or a better life. An increase in legal immigrants migrating to the United States also led to an increase of illegal aliens, especially from Mexico. Most of these immigrants searched for and gained jobs where hard labor was needed. As the immigration population increased American citizens started to worry about their impact on the economy.\\r\\nThe reform did not have a lot of impact on decreasing the immigrant population, \\"Until 2012, there was virtually no movement in Congress to deal with the problem of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States since the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted amnesty to many of the 3.2 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\"In 1983, the Supreme Court forbade schools and hospitals to deny services based on undocumented immigration status.\\" [11]\\r\\nOne study finds that the legalization of three million immigrants reduced crime by 3-5%, primarily property crime.[12] The author finds that this is due to greater job market opportunities for the immigrants.[12]\\r\\nFollowing the Short title, the IRCA is divided into seven Titles (I through VII).

The vault is used to store a large portion of United States official gold reserves and occasionally other precious items belonging or entrusted to the federal government. It is estimated to hold roughly 2.3% of all the gold ever refined throughout human history.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which outlawed the private ownership of gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates by American citizens, forcing them to sell these to the Federal Reserve. As a result, the value of the gold held by the Federal Reserve increased from $4 billion to $12 billion between 1933 and 1937.[3] This left the federal government with a large gold reserve and no place to store it. In 1936, the U.S. Treasury Department began construction of the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, on land transferred from the military. The Gold Vault was completed in December 1936 for US $560,000. The site is located on what is now Bullion Boulevard at the intersection of Gold Vault Road. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, in recognition of its significance in the economic history of the United States and its status as a well-known landmark.[4] It is constructed of granite quarried at the North Carolina Granite Corporation Quarry Complex.[5]\\r\\nThe first gold shipments were made from January to July 1937. The majority of the United States' gold reserves were gradually shipped to the site, including old bullion and newly made bars made from melted gold coins. Some intact coins were stored. The transfer used 500 rail cars and was sent by registered mail, protected by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Treasury Department agents.[citation needed] In 1974, a Washington attorney named Peter David Beter circulated a theory that the gold in the Depository had been secretly removed by elites, and that the vaults were empty. A group of reporters was allowed inside in order to refute the theory, which had gained traction thanks to coverage in tabloid newspapers and on the radio. Other than this 1974 event, no member of the public has been allowed inside.[6]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the depository held the original U.S. Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. It held the reserves of European countries and key documents from Western history. For example, it held the Crown of St. Stephen, part of the Hungarian crown jewels, given to American soldiers to prevent them from falling into Soviet hands. The repository held one of four copies (exemplifications) of Magna Carta, which had been sent for display at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and when war broke out, was kept in the US for the duration.\\r\\nDuring World War II and into the Cold War, until the invention of different types of synthetic painkillers, a supply of processed morphine and opium was kept in the Depository as a hedge against the US being isolated from the sources of raw opium.[7]\\r\\nBelow the fortress-like structure lies the gold vault lined with granite walls and protected by a blast-proof door weighing 20 tons. Members of the Depository staff must dial separate combinations known only to them.[8] Beyond the main vault door, smaller compartments provide further protection.[9] According to a Mosler Safe Company brochure:\\r\\nThe most famous, if not the largest, vault door order came from the Federal government in 1935 for the newly constructed gold depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Both the vault door and emergency door were 21-inches thick and made of the latest torch- and drill-resistant material. The main vault door weighed 20 tons and the vault casing was 25-inches thick.[10]\\r\\nThe facility is ringed with fences and is guarded by the United States Mint Police. The Depository premises are within the site of Fort Knox, a US Army post, allowing the Army to provide additional protection. The Depository is protected by layers of physical security, alarms, video cameras, microphones, mine fields, barbed razor wire, electric fences, heavily armed guards, and the Army units based at Fort Knox, including unmarked Apache helicopter gunships of 8/229 Aviation based at Godman Army Airfield, the 19th Engineer Battalion, formerly training battalions of the United States Army Armor School, and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Infantry Division, totaling 30,000 soldiers, with associated tanks, armored personnel carriers, attack helicopters, and artillery.\\r\\nThere is an escape tunnel from the lower level of the vault to be used by someone who has been accidentally locked in.[6]\\r\\nFor security reasons, no visitors are allowed inside the depository grounds. This policy has been enforced ever since the vault opened, with only two exceptions. The first was an inspection by members of the United States Congress and the news media on September 23, 1974 led by then Director of the United States Mint, Mary Brooks.[6] The second was a similar inspection made by the congress members on August 21, 2017, led by Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.[11]\\r\\nAs of April 2016[update], Fort Knox holdings are 4,582 metric tons (147.3 million oz. troy).[12] At the rate of $1,226.60 an ounce[13] it is worth about $180 billion.\\r\\nThe depository also holds monetary gold coins.[citation needed] The 1933 Double Eagle was also a temporary resident after transfer from 7 World Trade Center in July 2001, until its sale in July 2002 for $7.59 million. Sometime in 2004, ten additional allegedly stolen 1933 Double Eagles were transported to Fort Knox for safekeeping.[citation needed]\\r\\nNot all the gold bars held in the depository are of exactly the same composition. The mint gold bars are nearly pure gold. Bars made from melted gold coins, called \\"coin bars\\", are the same composition as the original coins, which is 90% gold. Unlike many .999 fine gold bullion coins minted in modern times for holding-purposes today, the coin alloy for pre-1933 US coins, which were intended for circulation, was a tougher and wear-resistant .900 fine alloy (balance copper) used for all US gold coins since 1837. (See crown gold for further gold coin alloy history.)\\r\\nThe US holds more gold than any other country, with about 8,133 metric tons in total (not just at Fort Knox), or about 2.4 times that of the next leading country, Germany (which in 2014 owned 3,387.1 metric tons).[14]\\r\\nSamsung Knox, an enterprise mobile security solution developed by Samsung Group is named after Fort Knox.[15]\\r\\nThe Depository figures prominently as the focus of the villain's plot in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger. Auric Goldfinger's goal is to break into the Depository and plant an atomic device. When it explodes, the entire US gold supply will be irradiated for decades to come and the worth of Goldfinger's own personal gold supply will skyrocket, making Goldfinger richer.\\r\\nThe depository is also featured in the finale of the 1952 Bugs Bunny cartoon \\"14 Carrot Rabbit\\".","input":"How much gold does the us federal reserve have?"},{"output":"September 25, 1789","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution.[1] Proposed following the often bitter 1787ÿ88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgments by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 8, 1789, Representative James Madison introduced nine amendments to the Constitution in the House of Representatives.[2] Madison proposed inserting specific rights limiting the power of Congress in Article One, Section 9. Seven of these limitations would become part of the ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment to the Constitution, each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's original proposal that the articles be incorporated into the main body of the Constitution, they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution. Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5, 1992, as the Twenty-seventh Amendment.[1][3] Article One is still pending before the states.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Madison's proposed amendments included a provision to extend the protection of some of the Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several original engrossed copies of the Bill of Rights still in existence. One of these is on permanent public display at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the ratification and implementation of the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation was too weak to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states.[5] The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention took place from May 14 to September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although the Convention was purportedly intended only to revise the Articles, the intention of many of its proponents, chief among them James Madison of Virginia and Alexander Hamilton of New York, was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The convention convened in the Pennsylvania State House, and George Washington of Virginia was unanimously elected as president of the convention.[6] The 55 delegates who drafted the Constitution are among the men known as the Founding Fathers of the new nation. Thomas Jefferson, who was Minister to France during the convention, characterized the delegates as an assembly of \\"demi-gods.\\"[5] Rhode Island refused to send delegates to the convention.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 12, George Mason of Virginia suggested the addition of a Bill of Rights to the Constitution modeled on previous state declarations, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts made it a formal motion.[8] However, the motion was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations after only a brief discussion. Madison, then an opponent of a Bill of Rights, later explained the vote by calling the state bills of rights \\"parchment barriers\\" that offered only an illusion of protection against tyranny.[9] Another delegate, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, later argued that the act of enumerating the rights of the people would have been dangerous, because it would imply that rights not explicitly mentioned did not exist;[9] Hamilton echoed this point in Federalist No. 84.[10] Because Mason and Gerry had emerged as opponents of the proposed new Constitution, their motionintroduced five days before the end of the conventionmay also have been seen by other delegates as a delaying tactic.[11] The quick rejection of this motion, however, later endangered the entire ratification process. Author David O. Stewart characterizes the omission of a Bill of Rights in the original Constitution as \\"a political blunder of the first magnitude\\"[11] while historian Jack N. Rakove calls it \\"the one serious miscalculation the framers made as they looked ahead to the struggle over ratification\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-nine delegates signed the finalized Constitution. Thirteen delegates left before it was completed, and three who remained at the convention until the end refused to sign it: Mason, Gerry, and Edmund Randolph of Virginia.[13] Afterward, the Constitution was presented to the Articles of Confederation Congress with the request that it afterwards be submitted to a convention of delegates, chosen in each State by the people, for their assent and ratification.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Philadelphia Convention, some leading revolutionary figures such as Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, and Richard Henry Lee publicly opposed the new frame of government, a position known as \\"Anti-Federalism\\".[15] Elbridge Gerry wrote the most popular Anti-Federalist tract, \\"Hon. Mr. Gerry's Objections\\", which went through 46 printings; the essay particularly focused on the lack of a bill of rights in the proposed constitution.[16] Many were concerned that a strong national government was a threat to individual rights and that the president would become a king. Jefferson wrote to Madison advocating a Bill of Rights: \\"Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our rights, let us secure what we can.\\"[17] The pseudonymous Anti-Federalist \\"Brutus\\"[a] wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find they have, in the ninth section of the first article declared, that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless in cases of rebellionthat no bill of attainder, or ex post facto law, shall be passedthat no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States, etc. If every thing which is not given is reserved, what propriety is there in these exceptions? Does this Constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus, to make ex post facto laws, pass bills of attainder, or grant titles of nobility? It certainly does not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that these are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth it may be said, that all the powers which the bills of rights guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the general ones granted by this Constitution.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continued with this observation:\\r\\n\\r\\nOught not a government, vested with such extensive and indefinite authority, to have been restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly ought. So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States, are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters of the Constitution, known as Federalists, opposed a bill of rights for much of the ratification period, in part due to the procedural uncertainties it would create.[21] Madison argued against such an inclusion, suggesting that state governments were sufficient guarantors of personal liberty, in No. 46 of The Federalist Papers, a series of essays promoting the Federalist position.[22] Hamilton opposed a bill of rights in The Federalist No. 84, stating that \\"the constitution is itself in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, a bill of rights.\\" He stated that ratification did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights, making protections unnecessary: \\"Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain everything, they have no need of particular reservations.\\" Patrick Henry criticized the Federalist point of view, writing that the legislature must be firmly informed \\"of the extent of the rights retained by the people ... being in a state of uncertainty, they will assume rather than give up powers by implication.\\"[23] Other anti-Federalists pointed out that earlier political documents, in particular the Magna Carta, had protected specific rights. In response, Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different:\\r\\n\\r\\nBills of rights are in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgments of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was the Magna Charta, obtained by the Barons, swords in hand, from King John.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1787 and January 1788, five statesDelaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticutratified the Constitution with relative ease, though the bitter minority report of the Pennsylvania opposition was widely circulated.[25] In contrast to its predecessors, the Massachusetts convention was angry and contentious, at one point erupting into a fistfight between Federalist delegate Francis Dana and Anti-Federalist Elbridge Gerry when the latter was not allowed to speak.[26] The impasse was resolved only when revolutionary heroes and leading Anti-Federalists Samuel Adams and John Hancock agreed to ratification on the condition that the convention also propose amendments.[27] The convention's proposed amendments included a requirement for grand jury indictment in capital cases, which would form part of the Fifth Amendment, and an amendment reserving powers to the states not expressly given to the federal government, which would later form the basis for the Tenth Amendment.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Massachusetts' lead, the Federalist minorities in both Virginia and New York were able to obtain ratification in convention by linking ratification to recommended amendments.[29] A committee of the Virginia convention headed by law professor George Wythe forwarded forty recommended amendments to Congress, twenty of which enumerated individual rights and another twenty of which enumerated states' rights.[30] The latter amendments included limitations on federal powers to levy taxes and regulate trade.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nA minority of the Constitution's critics, such as Maryland's Luther Martin, continued to oppose ratification.[32] However, Martin's allies, such as New York's John Lansing, Jr., dropped moves to obstruct the Convention's process. They began to take exception to the Constitution \\"as it was,\\" seeking amendments. Several conventions saw supporters for \\"amendments before\\" shift to a position of \\"amendments after\\" for the sake of staying in the Union. The New York Anti-Federalist \\"circular letter\\" was sent to each state legislature proposing a second constitutional convention for \\"amendments before\\", but it failed in the state legislatures. Ultimately, only North Carolina and Rhode Island waited for amendments from Congress before ratifying.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle Seven of the proposed Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government would be established. The new Constitution would become operational when ratified by at least nine states. Only then would it replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation and would apply only to those states that ratified it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing contentious battles in several states, the proposed Constitution reached that nine-state ratification plateau in June 1788. On September 13, 1788, the Articles of Confederation Congress certified that the new Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for the new system to be implemented and directed the new government to meet in New York City on the first Wednesday in March the following year.[33] On March 4, 1789, the new frame of government came into force with eleven of the thirteen states participating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1st United States Congress, which met in New York City's Federal Hall, was a triumph for the Federalists. The Senate of eleven states contained 20 Federalists with only two Anti-Federalists, both from Virginia. The House included 48 Federalists to 11 Anti-Federalists, the latter of whom were from only four states: Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and South Carolina.[34]\\r\\nAmong the Virginia delegation to the House was James Madison, Patrick Henry's chief opponent in the Virginia ratification battle. In retaliation for Madison's victory in that battle at Virginia's ratification convention, Henry and other Anti-Federalists, who controlled the Virginia House of Delegates, had gerrymandered a hostile district for Madison's planned congressional run and recruited Madison's future presidential successor, James Monroe, to oppose him.[35] Madison defeated Monroe after offering a campaign pledge that he would introduce constitutional amendments forming a bill of rights at the First Congress.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally opposed to the inclusion of a bill of rights in the Constitution, Madison had gradually come to understand the importance of doing so during the often contentious ratification debates. By taking the initiative to propose amendments himself through the Congress, he hoped to preempt a second constitutional convention that might, it was feared, undo the difficult compromises of 1787, and open the entire Constitution to reconsideration, thus risking the dissolution of the new federal government. Writing to Jefferson, he stated, \\"The friends of the Constitution, some from an approbation of particular amendments, others from a spirit of conciliation, are generally agreed that the System should be revised. But they wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty.\\"[37] He also felt that amendments guaranteeing personal liberties would \\"give to the Government its due popularity and stability\\".[38] Finally, he hoped that the amendments \\"would acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion\\".[39] Historians continue to debate the degree to which Madison considered the amendments of the Bill of Rights necessary, and to what degree he considered them politically expedient; in the outline of his address, he wrote, \\"Bill of Rightsusefulnot essential\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion of his April 30, 1789 inauguration as the nation's first president, George Washington addressed the subject of amending the Constitution. He urged the legislators,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience; a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen, and a regard for public harmony, will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question, how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Madison introduced a series of Constitutional amendments in the House of Representatives for consideration. Among his proposals was one that would have added introductory language stressing natural rights to the preamble.[43] Another would apply parts of the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal government. Several sought to protect individual personal rights by limiting various Constitutional powers of Congress. Like Washington, Madison urged Congress to keep the revision to the Constitution \\"a moderate one\\", limited to protecting individual rights.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nMadison was deeply read in the history of government and used a range of sources in composing the amendments. The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right to keep and bear arms (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest influence on Madison's text, however, was existing state constitutions.[44][45] Many of his amendments, including his proposed new preamble, were based on the Virginia Declaration of Rights drafted by Anti-Federalist George Mason in 1776.[46] To reduce future opposition to ratification, Madison also looked for recommendations shared by many states.[45] He did provide one, however, that no state had requested: \\"No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.\\"[47] He did not include an amendment that every state had asked for, one that would have made tax assessments voluntary instead of contributions.[48] Madison's proposed the following constitutional amendments:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst. That there be prefixed to the Constitution a declaration, that all power is originally vested in, and consequently derived from, the people.That Government is instituted and ought to be exercised for the benefit of the people; which consists in the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right of acquiring and using property, and generally of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.That the people have an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform or change their Government, whenever it be found adverse or inadequate to the purposes of its institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly. That in article 1st, section 2, clause 3, these words be struck out, to wit: \\"The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative, and until such enumeration shall be made;\\" and in place thereof be inserted these words, to wit: \\"After the first actual enumeration, there shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until the number amounts to, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that the number shall never be less than, nor more than, but each State shall, after the first enumeration, have at least two Representatives; and prior thereto.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThirdly. That in article 1st, section 6, clause 1, there be added to the end of the first sentence, these words, to wit: \\"But no law varying the compensation last ascertained shall operate before the next ensuing election of Representatives.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFourthly. That in article 1st, section 9, between clauses 3 and 4, be inserted these clauses, to wit: The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed.\\r\\nThe people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good; nor from applying to the legislature by petitions, or remonstrances for redress of their grievances.The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.No soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner; nor at any time, but in a manner warranted by law.No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment, or one trial for the same offence; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without a just compensation.Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.The rights of the people to be secured in their persons, their houses, their papers, and their other property, from all unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated by warrants issued without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, or not particularly describing the places to be searched, or the persons or things to be seized.In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the cause and nature of the accusation, to be confronted with his accusers, and the witnesses against him; to have a compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.The exceptions here or elsewhere in the Constitution, made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people, or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the Constitution; but either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifthly. That in article 1st, section 10, between clauses 1 and 2, be inserted this clause, to wit: No State shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixthly. That, in article 3d, section 2, be annexed to the end of clause 2d, these words, to wit: But no appeal to such court shall be allowed where the value in controversy shall not amount to  dollars: nor shall any fact triable by jury, according to the course of common law, be otherwise re-examinable than may consist with the principles of common law.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventhly. That in article 3d, section 2, the third clause be struck out, and in its place be inserted the clauses following, to wit: The trial of all crimes (except in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, of the right with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, of the right of challenge, and other accustomed requisites; and in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary, provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy, or in which a general insurrection may prevail, the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same State, as near as may be to the seat of the offence.In cases of crimes committed not within any county, the trial may by law be in such county as the laws shall have prescribed. In suits at common law, between man and man, the trial by jury, as one of the best securities to the rights of the people, ought to remain inviolate.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighthly. That immediately after article 6th, be inserted, as article 7th, the clauses following, to wit: The powers delegated by this Constitution are appropriated to the departments to which they are respectively distributed: so that the Legislative Department shall never exercise the powers vested in the Executive or Judicial, nor the Executive exercise the powers vested in the Legislative or Judicial, nor the Judicial exercise the powers vested in the Legislative or Executive Departments.The powers not delegated by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinthly. That article 7th, be numbered as article 8th.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nFederalist representatives were quick to attack Madison's proposal, fearing that any move to amend the new Constitution so soon after its implementation would create an appearance of instability in the government.[50] The House, unlike the Senate, was open to the public, and members such as Fisher Ames warned that a prolonged \\"dissection of the constitution\\" before the galleries could shake public confidence.[51] A procedural battle followed, and after initially forwarding the amendments to a select committee for revision, the House agreed to take Madison's proposal up as a full body beginning on July 21, 1789.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eleven-member committee made some significant changes to Madison's nine proposed amendments, including eliminating most of his preamble and adding the phrase \\"freedom of speech, and of the press\\".[54] The House debated the amendments for eleven days. Roger Sherman of Connecticut persuaded the House to place the amendments at the Constitution's end so that the document would \\"remain inviolate\\", rather than adding them throughout, as Madison had proposed.[55][56] The amendments, revised and condensed from twenty to seventeen, were approved and forwarded to the Senate on August 24, 1789.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Senate edited these amendments still further, making 26 changes of its own. Madison's proposal to apply parts of the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal government was eliminated, and the seventeen amendments were condensed to twelve, which were approved on September 9, 1789.[58] The Senate also eliminated the last of Madison's proposed changes to the preamble.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 21, 1789, a HouseÿSenate Conference Committee convened to resolve the numerous differences between the two Bill of Rights proposals. On September 24, 1789, the committee issued this report, which finalized 12 Constitutional Amendments for House and Senate to consider. This final version was approved by joint resolution of Congress on September 25, 1789, to be forwarded to the states on September 28.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time the debates and legislative maneuvering that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention.[62] Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nMadison remained active in the progress of the amendments throughout the legislative process. Historian Gordon S. Wood writes that \\"there is no question that it was Madison's personal prestige and his dogged persistence that saw the amendments through the Congress. There might have been a federal Constitution without Madison but certainly no Bill of Rights.\\"[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelve articles of amendment approved by congress were officially submitted to the Legislatures of the several States for consideration on September 28, 1789. The following states ratified some or all of the amendments:[67][68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving been approved by the requisite three-fourths of the several states, there being 14 States in the Union at the time (as Vermont had been admitted into the Union on March 4, 1791),[63] the ratification of Articles Three through Twelve was completed and they became Amendments 1 through 10 of the Constitution. President Washington informed Congress of this on January 18, 1792.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they had not yet been approved by 11 of the 14 states, the ratification of Article One (ratified by 10) and Article Two (ratified by 6) remained incomplete. The ratification plateau they needed to reach soon rose to 12 of 15 states when Kentucky joined the Union (June 1, 1792). On June 27, 1792, the Kentucky General Assembly ratified all 12 amendments, however this action did not come to light until 1996.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle One came within one state of the number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two occasions between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states to become part of the Constitution.[64] As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle Two, initially ratified by seven states through 1792 (including Kentucky), was not ratified by another state for eighty years. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it on May 6, 1873 in protest of an unpopular Congressional pay raise.[73] A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also ratified the article.[74] Gregory Watson, a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student, started a new push for the article's ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures.[73] As a result, by May 1992, enough states had approved Article Two (38 of the 50 states in the Union) for it to become the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment's adoption was certified by Archivist of the United States Don W. Wilson and subsequently affirmed by a vote of Congress on May 20, 1992.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree states did not complete action on the twelve articles of amendment when they were initially put before the states. Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify. Both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court ratified a number of the amendments (the Senate adopted 10 of 12 and the House 9 of 12), but failed to reconcile their two lists or to send official notice to the Secretary of State of the ones they did agree upon.[76][63] Both houses of the Connecticut General Assembly voted to ratify Articles Three through Twelve but failed to reconcile their bills after disagreeing over whether to ratify Articles One and Two.[77] All three later ratified the Constitutional amendments originally known as Articles Three through Twelve as part of the 1939 commemoration of the Bill of Rights' sesquicentennial: Massachusetts on March 2, Georgia on March 18, and Connecticut on April 19.[63] Connecticut and Georgia would also later ratify Article Two, on May 13, 1987 and February 2, 1988 respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bill of Rights had little judicial impact for the first 150 years of its existence; in the words of Gordon S. Wood, \\"After ratification, most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution.\\"[78][79] The Court made no important decisions protecting free speech rights, for example, until 1931.[80] Historian Richard Labunski attributes the Bill's long legal dormancy to three factors: first, it took time for a \\"culture of tolerance\\" to develop that would support the Bill's provisions with judicial and popular will; second, the Supreme Court spent much of the 19th century focused on issues relating to intergovernmental balances of power; and third, the Bill initially only applied to the federal government, a restriction affirmed by Barron v. Baltimore (1833).[81][82][83] In the twentieth century, however, most of the Bill's provisions were applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendmenta process known as incorporationbeginning with the freedom of speech clause, in Gitlow v. New York (1925).[84] In Talton v. Mayes (1896), the Court ruled that Constitutional protections, including the provisions of the Bill of Rights, do not apply to the actions of American Indian tribal governments.[85] Through the incorporation process the United States Supreme Court succeeded in extending to the States almost all of the protections in the Bill of Rights, as well as other, unenumerated rights.[86] The Bill of Rights thus imposes legal limits on the powers of governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights.[87][88][89] The Supreme Court for example concluded in the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) case that the founders intended the Bill of Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities.[87][88][89][90] As the Court noted, the idea of the Bill of Rights \\"was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.\\"[90][91] This is why \\"fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\\"[90][91]\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Amendment prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Everson v. Board of Education (1947), the Court drew on Thomas Jefferson's correspondence to call for \\"a wall of separation between church and State\\", though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute.[93] Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th- and 21st-century court decisions that protected various forms of political speech, anonymous speech, campaign financing, pornography, and school speech; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections. The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for libel suits, most notably in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964).[94] Commercial speech is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech, and is therefore subject to greater regulation.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions, and applies to a wide variety of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931)[95] and New York Times v. United States (1971),[96] the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraintpre-publication censorshipin almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the Bill of Rights.[97] First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third Amendment re\\r\\nstricts the quartering of soldiers in private homes, in response to Quartering Acts passed by the British parliament during the Revolutionary War. The amendment is one of the least controversial of the Constitution, and, as of  2018[update], has never been the primary basis of a Supreme Court decision.[103][104][105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fourth Amendment guards against unreasonable searches and seizures, along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause. It was adopted as a response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment is the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into a criminal trial.[106] The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fifth Amendment protects against double jeopardy and self-incrimination and guarantees the rights to due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain. The amendment was the basis for the court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which established that defendants must be informed of their rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sixth Amendment establishes a number of rights of the defendant in a criminal trial:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), the Court ruled that the amendment guaranteed the right to legal representation in all felony prosecutions in both state and federal courts.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seventh Amendment guarantees jury trials in federal civil cases that deal with claims of more than twenty dollars. It also prohibits judges from overruling findings of fact by juries in federal civil trials. In Colgrove v. Battin (1973), the Court ruled that the amendment's requirements could be fulfilled by a jury with a minimum of six members. The Seventh is one of the few parts of the Bill of Rights not to be incorporated (applied to the states).[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition of excessive bails or fines, though it leaves the term \\"excessive\\" open to interpretation.[111] The most frequently litigated clause of the amendment is the last, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment.[112][113] This clause was only occasionally applied by the Supreme Court prior to the 1970s, generally in cases dealing with means of execution. In Furman v. Georgia (1972), some members of the Court found capital punishment itself in violation of the amendment, arguing that the clause could reflect \\"evolving standards of decency\\" as public opinion changed; others found certain practices in capital trials to be unacceptably arbitrary, resulting in a majority decision that effectively halted executions in the United States for several years.[114] Executions resumed following Gregg v. Georgia (1976), which found capital punishment to be constitutional if the jury was directed by concrete sentencing guidelines.[114] The Court has also found that some poor prison conditions constitute cruel and unusual punishment, as in Estelle v. Gamble (1976) and Brown v. Plata (2011).[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ninth Amendment declares that there are additional fundamental rights that exist outside the Constitution. The rights enumerated in the Constitution are not an explicit and exhaustive list of individual rights. It was rarely mentioned in Supreme Court decisions before the second half of the 20th century, when it was cited by several of the justices in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The Court in that case voided a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives as an infringement of the right of marital privacy.[115] This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built decisions in several landmark cases, including, Roe v. Wade (1973), which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get an abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated a Pennsylvania law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining an abortion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tenth Amendment reinforces the principles of separation of powers and federalism by providing that powers not granted to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states or the people. The amendment provides no new powers or rights to the states, but rather preserves their authority in all matters not specifically granted to the federal government.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress has sometimes gotten around the Tenth Amendment by invoking the Commerce Clause in Article One[117] or by threatening to withhold funding for a federal program from noncooperative States, as in South Dakota v. Dole (1987).\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Washington had fourteen handwritten copies of the Bill of Rights made, one for Congress and one for each of the original thirteen states.[118] The copies for Georgia, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania went missing.[119] The New York copy is thought to have been destroyed in a fire.[120] Two unidentified copies of the missing four (thought to be the Georgia and Maryland copies) survive; one is in the National Archives, and the other is in the New York Public Library.[121][122] North Carolina's copy was stolen from the State Capitol by a Union soldier following the Civil War. In an FBI sting operation, it was recovered in 2003.[123][124] The copy retained by the First Congress has been on display (along with the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence) in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom room at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. since December 13, 1952.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter fifty years on display, signs of deterioration in the casing were noted, while the documents themselves appeared to be well preserved.[126] Accordingly, the casing was updated and the Rotunda rededicated on September 17, 2003. In his dedicatory remarks, President George W. Bush stated, \\"The true [American] revolution was not to defy one earthly power, but to declare principles that stand above every earthly powerthe equality of each person before God, and the responsibility of government to secure the rights of all.\\"[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared December 15 to be Bill of Rights Day, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights.[128] In 1991, the Virginia copy of the Bill of Rights toured the country in honor of its bicentennial, visiting the capitals of all fifty states.[129]","input":"When was the us bill of rights written?"},{"output":"about 16 million years old","context":"The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), commonly known as the great white or the white shark, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The great white shark is notable for its size, with larger female individuals growing to 6.1?m (20?ft) in length and 1,905?kg (4,200?lb) in weight at maturity.[3][4][5] However most are smaller, males measuring 3.4 to 4.0?m (11 to 13?ft) and females 4.6 to 4.9?m (15 to 16?ft) on average.[5][6] According to a 2014 study the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates,[7] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known.[8] According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.[9] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56?km/h (35?mph),[10] and can swim to depths of 1,200?m (3,900?ft).[11]\\r\\nThe great white shark has no known natural predators other than, on very rare occasions, the killer whale.[12] The great white shark is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans.[13][14]\\r\\nThe species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection. The IUCN lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species,[2] and it is included in Appendix?II of CITES.[15] It is also protected by several national governments such as Australia (as of 2018).[16]\\r\\nThe novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the subsequent film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great white shark as a \\"ferocious man eater\\". Humans are not the preferred prey of the great white shark,[17] but, nevertheless, the great white is responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans.[18] The great white shark has also been called the white pointer or white death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great white shark was one of the many amphibia originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae,[19] its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its generic name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current scientific name, Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.[20]\\r\\nThe earliest known fossils of the great white shark are about 16 million years old, during the mid-Miocene epoch.[1] However, the phylogeny of the great white is still in dispute. The original hypothesis for the great white's origins is that it shares a common ancestor with a prehistoric shark, such as the C.?megalodon. C. megalodon had teeth that were superficially not too dissimilar with those of great white sharks, but its teeth were far larger. Although cartilaginous skeletons do not fossilize, C. megalodon is estimated to have been considerably larger than the great white shark, estimated at up to 17?m (56?ft) and 59,413?kg (130,983?lb).[21] Similarities among the physical remains and the extreme size of both the great white and C.?megalodon led many scientists to believe these sharks were closely related, and the name Carcharodon megalodon was applied to the latter. However, a new hypothesis proposes that the C.?megalodon and the great white are distant relatives (albeit sharing the family Lamnidae). The great white is also more closely related to an ancient mako shark, Isurus hastalis, than to the C.?megalodon, a theory that seems to be supported with the discovery of a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae of the extinct transitional species Carcharodon hubbelli in 1988 and published on 14 November 2012.[22] In addition, the new hypothesis assigns C.?megalodon to the genus Carcharocles, which also comprises the other megatoothed sharks; Otodus obliquus is the ancient representative of the extinct Carcharocles lineage.[23]\\r\\nGreat white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between 12 and 24?C (54 and 75?F), with greater concentrations in the United States (Northeast and California), South Africa, Japan, Oceania, Chile, and the Mediterranean including Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus.[24][25] One of the densest known populations is found around Dyer Island, South Africa.[26]\\r\\nThe great white is an epipelagic fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game, such as fur seals (Arctocephalus ssp.), sea lions, cetaceans, other sharks, and large bony fish species. In the open ocean, it has been recorded at depths as great as 1,200?m (3,900?ft).[11] These findings challenge the traditional notion that the great white is a coastal species.[11]\\r\\nAccording to a recent study, California great whites have migrated to an area between Baja California Peninsula and Hawaii known as the White Shark Caf to spend at least 100 days before migrating back to Baja. On the journey out, they swim slowly and dive down to around 900?m (3,000?ft). After they arrive, they change behavior and do short dives to about 300?m (1,000?ft) for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that was tagged off of the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year. A similar study tracked a different great white shark from South Africa swimming to Australia's northwestern coast and back, a journey of 20,000?km (12,000?mi; 11,000?nmi) in under nine months.[27] These observations argue against traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, and open up the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously thought to have been discrete. The reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include seasonal feeding or mating.[28]\\r\\nThe great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are approximately the same size which is similar to some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.[29]\\r\\nIn great white sharks, sexual dimorphism is present, and females are generally larger than males. Male great whites on average measure 3.4 to 4.0?m (11 to 13?ft) long, while females at 4.6 to 4.9?m (15 to 16?ft).[6] Adults of this species weigh 522ÿ771?kg (1,151ÿ1,700?lb) on average,[31] however mature females can have an average mass of 680ÿ1,110?kg (1,500ÿ2,450?lb).[5] The largest females have been verified up to 6.1?m (20?ft) in length and an estimated 1,905?kg (4,200?lb) in weight,[3][4][5] perhaps up to 2,268?kg (5,000?lb).[32] The maximum size is subject to debate because some reports are rough estimations or speculations performed under questionable circumstances.[33] Among living cartilaginous fish, only the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) and the giant manta ray (Manta birostris), in that order, average larger and heavier. These three species are generally quite docile in disposition and given to passively filter-feeding on very small organisms.[31] This makes the great white shark the largest extant macropredatory fish. Great white sharks are at around 1.2?m (3.9?ft) when born, and grow about 25?cm (9.8?in) each year.[34]\\r\\nAccording to J.?E. Randall, the largest white shark reliably measured was a 6.0?m (19.7?ft) individual reported from Ledge Point, Western Australia in 1987.[35] Another great white specimen of similar size has been verified by the Canadian Shark Research Center: A female caught by David McKendrick of Alberton, Prince Edward Island, in August 1988 in the Gulf of St.?Lawrence off Prince Edward Island. This female great white was 6.1?m (20?ft) long.[5] However, there was a report considered reliable by some experts in the past, of a larger great white shark specimen from Cuba in 1945.[36][37][38][39] This specimen was 6.4?m (21?ft) long and had a body mass estimated at 3,324?kg (7,328?lb).[36][38] However, later studies also revealed that this particular specimen was actually around 4.9?m (16?ft) in length, a specimen in the average maximum size range.[5]\\r\\nThe largest great white recognized by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) is one caught by Alf Dean in the south Australian waters in 1959, weighing 1,208?kg (2,663?lb).[33] Several larger great whites caught by anglers have since been verified, but were later disallowed from formal recognition by IGFA monitors for rules violations.\\r\\nA number of very large unconfirmed great white shark specimens have been recorded.[40] For decades, many ichthyological works, as well as the Guinness Book of World Records, listed two great white sharks as the largest individuals: In the 1870s, a 10.9?m (36?ft) great white captured in southern Australian waters, near Port Fairy, and an 11.3?m (37?ft) shark trapped in a herring weir in New Brunswick, Canada, in the 1930s. However these measurements are not scientific and researchers have questioned the reliability of these measurements for a long time, noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. Later studies proved these theories correct. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified basking shark, as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J.?E. Randall examined the shark's jaws and \\"found that the Port Fairy shark was of the order of 5?m (17?ft) in length and suggested that a mistake had been made in the original record, in 1870, of the shark's length\\".[35] These wrong measurements would make the alleged shark more than five times heavier than it really was.\\r\\nSeveral unconfirmed reports of great white sharks caught in modern times with have been estimated to be more than 7?m (23?ft) long,[41] but these claims have received some criticism.[33][41] However, J.?E. Randall believed that great white shark may have exceeded 6.1?m (20?ft) in length.[35] A great white shark was captured near Kangaroo Island in Australia on 1 April 1987. This shark was estimated to be more than 6.9?m (23?ft) long by Peter Resiley,[35][42] and has been designated as KANGA.[41] Another great white shark was caught in Malta by Alfredo Cutajar on 16 April 1987. This shark was also estimated to be around 7.13?m (23.4?ft) long by John Abela and has been designated as MALTA.[41] However, Cappo drew criticism because he used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.?E. Randall to suggest that the KANGA specimen was 5.8ÿ6.4?m (19ÿ21?ft) long.[41] In a similar fashion, I.?K. Fergusson also used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.?E. Randall to suggest that the MALTA specimen was 5.3ÿ5.7?m (17ÿ19?ft) long.[41] However, photographic evidence suggested that these specimens were larger than the size estimations yielded through Randall's methods.[41] Thus, a team of scientistsH.?F. Mollet, G.?M. Cailliet, A.?P. Klimley, D.?A. Ebert, A.?D. Testi, and L.?J.?V. Compagnoreviewed the cases of the KANGA and MALTA specimens in 1996 to resolve the dispute by conducting a comprehensive morphometric analysis of the remains of these sharks and re-examination of photographic evidence in an attempt to validate the original size estimations and their findings were consistent with them. The findings indicated that estimations by P.?Resiley and J.?Abela are reasonable and could not be ruled out.[41] A particularly large female great white nicknamed \\"Deep Blue\\", estimated measuring at 6.1?m (20?ft) was filmed off Guadalupe during shooting for the 2014 episode of Shark Week \\"Jaws Strikes Back\\". Deep Blue would also later gain significant attention when she was filmed interacting with researcher Mauricio Hoyas Pallida in a viral video that Mauricio posted on Facebook on 11 June 2015.[43] A particularly infamous great white shark, supposedly of record proportions, once patrolled the area that comprises False Bay, South Africa, was said to be well over 7 metres (23?ft) during the early 1980s. This shark, known locally as the \\"Submarine\\", had a legendary reputation that was supposedly well founded. Though rumors have stated this shark was exaggerated in size or non-existent altogether, witness accounts by the then young Craig Anthony Ferreira, a notable shark expert in South Africa, and his father indicate an unusually large animal of considerable size and power (though it remains uncertain just how massive the shark was as it escaped capture each time it was hooked). Ferreira describes the four encounters with the giant shark he participated in with great detail in his book \\"Great White Sharks On Their Best Behavior\\".[44]\\r\\nOne contender in maximum size among the predatory sharks is the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). While tiger sharks which are typically both a few feet smaller and have a leaner, less heavy body structure than white sharks, have been confirmed to reach at least 5.5 metres (18?ft) in the length, an unverified specimen was reported to have measured 7.4 metres (24?ft) in length and weighed 3,110 kilograms (6,860?lb), more than two times heavier than the largest confirmed specimen at 1,524 kilograms (3,360?lb).[31][45][46] Some other macropredatory sharks such as the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) and the Pacific sleeper shark (S. pacificus) are also reported to rival these sharks in length (but probably weigh a bit less since they are more slender in build than a great white) in exceptional cases.[47][48] The question of maximum weight is complicated by the unresolved question of whether or not to include the shark's stomach contents when weighing the shark. With a single bite a great white can take in up to 14?kg (31?lb) of flesh, and can also consume several hundred kilograms of food.\\r\\nGreat white sharks, like all other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the electromagnetic field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.[49]\\r\\nTo more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a \\"rete mirabile\\" (Latin for \\"wonderful net\\"). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to 14?C (25?F)[50] above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white shark's success in raising its core temperature is an example of gigantothermy. Therefore, the great white shark can be considered an endothermic poikilotherm because its body temperature is not constant but is internally regulated.[29] Great whites also rely on the fat and oils stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans.[51] Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that In addition to controlling the sharks' buoyancy, the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns. Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.[52]\\r\\nA 2007 study from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, used CT scans of a shark's skull and computer models to measure the shark's maximum bite force. The study reveals the forces and behaviors its skull is adapted to handle and resolves competing theories about its feeding behavior.[53] In 2008, a team of scientists led by Stephen Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the great white shark's jaw power and findings indicated that a specimen massing 3,324?kg (7,328?lb) could exert a bite force of 18,216 newtons (4,095?lbf).[38]\\r\\nThis shark's behavior and social structure is not well understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.\\r\\nThe great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as spy-hopping. This behavior has also been seen in at least one group of blacktip reef sharks, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable \\"clans\\" of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.[54]\\r\\nGreat white sharks are carnivorous and prey upon fish (e.g. tuna, rays,[54] other sharks[54]), cetaceans (i.e., dolphins, porpoises, whales), pinnipeds (e.g. seals, fur seals,[54] and sea lions), sea turtles,[54] sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and seabirds.[55] Great whites have also been known to eat objects that they are unable to digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish including other elasmobranchs, as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of 3 meters (9.8?ft) or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species.[56] Upon approaching a length of nearly 4 meters (13?ft), great white sharks begin to target predominately marine mammals for food, though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences.[57][58] They seem to be highly opportunistic.[59][60] These sharks prefer prey with a high content of energy-rich fat. Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal, a pig, and a sheep from his boat in the South Farallons. The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.[61]\\r\\nOff California, sharks immobilize northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) with a large bite to the hindquarters (which is the main source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between 1,500 and 2,000?kg (3,300 and 4,400?lb), and are potentially dangerous adversaries.[62][63] Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies.[64] Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.[65]\\r\\nWhite sharks also attack dolphins and porpoises from above, behind or below to avoid being detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus),[41] Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus),[41] bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.),[41][66] Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.),[66] harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena),[41] and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli).[41] Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour.[66] White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a 1.8-meter (5.9?ft) juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark.[67] In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales.[41][66] Cases where an adult Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around 1,100?kg (2,400?lb),[68] and a juvenile Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at 3?m (9.8?ft), were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed.[69] When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), has been found in great white shark stomachs.[59]\\r\\nOff Seal Island, False Bay in South Africa, the sharks ambush brown fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) from below at high speeds, hitting the seal mid-body. They can go so fast that they completely leave the water. The peak burst speed is estimated to be above 40 kilometers per hour (25?mph).[70] They have also been observed chasing prey after a missed attack. Prey is usually attacked at the surface.[71] Shark attacks most often occur in the morning, within 2 hours of sunrise, when visibility is poor. Their success rate is 55% in the first 2 hours, falling to 40% in late morning after which hunting stops.[54]\\r\\nWhale carcasses comprise an important part of the diet of white sharks. However, this has rarely been observed due to whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that 30?kg (66?lb) of whale blubber could feed a 4.5?m (15?ft) white shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection, spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale caudal peduncle and fluke, the sharks would investigate the carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding bouts of 15ÿ20 seconds the sharks removed flesh with lateral headshakes, without the protective ocular rotation they employ when attacking live prey. The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of blubber and immediately returning to feed, possibly in order to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield pieces, using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish them. After feeding for several hours, the sharks appeared to become lethargic, no longer swimming to the surface; they were observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite hard enough to remove flesh, they would instead bounce off and slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding simultaneously, bumping into each other without showing any signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit the head of a neighbouring shark, leaving two teeth embedded, but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away. Unusually for the area, large numbers of sharks over five metres long were observed, suggesting that the largest sharks change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the maneuverability required to hunt seals. The investigating team concluded that the importance of whale carcasses, particularly for the largest white sharks, has been underestimated.[72] In another documented incident, white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks.[73]\\r\\nStomach contents of great whites also indicates that whale sharks both juvenile and adult may also be included on the animal's menu, though whether this is active hunting or scavenging is not known at present.[74][75]\\r\\nGreat white sharks were previously thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 years to reach sexual maturity.[9][76][77] Maximum life span was originally believed to be more than 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.[8]\\r\\nLittle is known about the great white shark's mating habits. It is possible that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating.[72] Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth.[78] The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer.[79] The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.[citation needed]\\r\\nA breach is the result of a high speed approach to the surface with the resulting momentum taking the shark partially or completely clear of the water. This is a hunting technique employed by great white sharks whilst hunting seals. This technique is often used on cape fur seals at Seal Island in False Bay, South Africa. Because the behavior is unpredictable, it is very hard to document. It was first photographed by Chris Fallows and Rob Lawrence who developed the technique of towing a slow-moving seal decoy to trick the sharks to breach.[80] Between April and September, scientists may observe around 600 breaches. The seals swim on the surface and the great white sharks launch their predatory attack from the deeper water below. They can reach speeds of up to 40 kilometers per hour (25?mph) and can at times launch themselves more than 3.0 metres (10?ft) into the air. Just under half of observed breach attacks are successful.[81] In 2011, a 3-meter (9.8?ft) long shark jumped onto a seven-person research vessel off Seal Island in Mossel Bay. The crew were undertaking a population study using sardines as bait, and the incident was judged not to be an attack on the boat but an accident.[82]\\r\\nInterspecific competition between the great white shark and the orca is probable in regions where dietary preferences of both species may overlap.[66] An incident was documented on 4 October 1997, in the Farallon Islands off California in the United States. An estimated 4.7ÿ5.3-meter (15ÿ17?ft) female orca immobilized an estimated 3ÿ4-meter (9.8ÿ13.1?ft) great white shark.[83] The orca held the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility and kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate. The orca then proceeded to eat the dead shark's liver.[66][83][84] It is believed that the scent of the slain shark's carcass caused all the great whites in the region to flee, forfeiting an opportunity for a great seasonal feed.[85] Another similar attack apparently occurred there in 2000, but its outcome is not clear.[86] After both attacks, the local population of about 100 great whites vanished.[84][86] Following the 2000 incident, a great white with a satellite tag was found to have immediately submerged to a depth of 500?m (1,600?ft) and swum to Hawaii.[86] In 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a great white shark off South Australia.[87] In 2017, along the South African coast, four great whites were found washed ashore with their livers removed with what was described as 'surgical precision'. Local scientists claim that pods of orcas in the area were to blame for the attacks.[88]\\r\\nIt is unclear how much of a concurrent increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable.[2] Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.\\r\\nThe IUCN notes that very little is known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears uncommon compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable.[2] It is included in Appendix II of CITES,[15] meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit.[89] As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks.[90] A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range.[91] According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2,000 great white sharks near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.[92][93]\\r\\nFishermen target many sharks for their jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely an object of commercial fishing, although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as smooth-hound shark.[94]\\r\\nThe great white shark was declared Vulnerable by the Australian Government in 1999 because of significant population decline and is currently protected under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.[95] The causes of decline prior to protection included mortality from sport fishing harvests as well as being caught in beach protection netting.[96]\\r\\nThe national conservation status of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction.[95] Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as Threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.[95]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Australian government created the White Shark Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation in addition to federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities.[96] An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions.[16] A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's White Shark population was separated by Bass Strait into genetically distinct eastern and western populations, indicating a need for the development of regional conservation strategies.[97]\\r\\nPresently, human-caused shark mortality is continuing, primarily from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing as well as from being caught in beach protection netting, and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.[16]\\r\\nThe Australasian population of great white sharks is believed to be in excess of 8,000-10,000 individuals according to genetic research studies done by CSIRO, with an adult population estimated to be around 2,210 individuals in both Eastern and Western Australia. The annual survival rate for juveniles in these two separate populations was estimated in the same study to be close to 73 percent, while adult sharks had a 93 percent annual survival rate. Whether or not mortality rates in great white sharks have declined, or the population has increased as a result of the protection of this species in Australian waters is as yet unknown due to the slow growth rates of this species.[98]\\r\\nAs of April 2007, great white sharks were fully protected within 370 kilometers (230?mi) of New Zealand and additionally from fishing by New Zealand-flagged boats outside this range. The maximum penalty is a $250,000 fine and up to six months in prison.[99]\\r\\nIn 2013, great white sharks were added to California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the population of great whites in the North Pacific was estimated to be fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.[100]\\r\\nA 2014 study estimated the population of great white sharks along the California coastline to be approximately 2,400.[101][102]\\r\\nIn 2015 Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its significant and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to both protect the sharks and public health.[103]\\r\\nWhile the term \\"shark attack\\" is in common use for instances of humans being wounded by sharks, it has been suggested that this is based largely on the misconception that white sharks and other large predatory sharks (such as bull and tiger sharks) seek out humans as prey. A recent review recommends that only in the very rare instances where a shark clearly predated on a human should the bite incident be termed an \\"attack,\\" which implies predation, and that otherwise it is more accurate to class bite incidents as \\"sighting\\", \\"encounter\\", \\"bite incident\\", or \\"fatal bite incident\\". Sightings do not include physical interaction, encounters include physical interaction without harm, shark bites include minor and major shark bite incidents, including those that do and do not require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents are those that result in death. The study suggests that only in a case where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.[104]\\r\\nOf all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans, with 272 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of 2012.[18]\\r\\nMore than any documented bite incident, Peter Benchley's best-selling novel Jaws and the subsequent 1975 film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg provided the great white shark with the image of being a \\"man eater\\" in the public mind.[105] While great white sharks have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked bite incidents, they typically do not target them: for example, in the Mediterranean Sea there have been 31 confirmed bite incidents against humans in the last two centuries, most of which were non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be \\"test-bites\\". Great white sharks also test-bite buoys, flotsam, and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a surfboard to identify what it is.\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals.[106] Many bite incidents occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.[107]\\r\\nHumans are not appropriate prey because the shark's digestion is too slow to cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.[108]\\r\\nHowever, some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability to move out of reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.[109]\\r\\nIn 2014 the state government of Western Australia led by Premier Colin Barnett implemented a policy of killing large sharks. The policy, colloquially referred to as the Western Australian shark cull, was intended to protect users of the marine environment from shark bite incidents, following the deaths of seven people on the Western Australian coastline in the years 2010ÿ2013.[110] Baited drum lines were deployed near popular beaches using hooks designed to catch great white sharks, as well as bull and tiger sharks. Large sharks found hooked but still alive were shot and their bodies discarded at sea.[111] The government claimed they were not culling the sharks, but were using a \\"targeted, localised, hazard mitigation strategy\\".[112] Barnett described opposition as \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"extreme\\", and said that nothing could change his mind.[113] This policy was met with widespread condemnation from the scientific community, which showed that species responsible for bite incidents were notoriously hard to identify, that the drum lines failed to capture white sharks, as intended, and that the government also failed to show any correlation between their drum line policy and a decrease in shark bite incidents in the region.[114]\\r\\nGreat white sharks infrequently bite and sometimes even sink boats. Only five of the 108 authenticated unprovoked shark bite incidents reported from the Pacific Coast during the 20th century involved kayakers.[115] In a few cases they have bitten boats up to 10 meters (33?ft) in length. They have bumped or knocked people overboard, usually biting the boat from the stern. In one case in 1936, a large shark leapt completely into the South African fishing boat Lucky Jim, knocking a crewman into the sea. Tricas and McCosker's underwater observations suggest that sharks are attracted to boats by the electrical fields they generate, which are picked up by the ampullae of Lorenzini and confuse the shark about whether or not wounded prey might be near-by.[116]\\r\\nPrior to August 1981, no great white shark in captivity lived longer than 11 days. In August 1981, a great white survived for 16 days at SeaWorld San Diego before being released.[117] The idea of containing a live great white at SeaWorld Orlando was used in the 1983 film Jaws 3-D.\\r\\nMonterey Bay Aquarium first attempted to display a great white in 1984, but the shark died after 11 days because it did not eat.[118] In July 2003, Monterey researchers captured a small female and kept it in a large netted pen near Malibu for five days. They had the rare success of getting the shark to feed in captivity before its release.[119] Not until September 2004 was the aquarium able to place a great white on long-term exhibit. A young female, which was caught off the coast of Ventura, was kept in the aquarium's 3,800,000-liter (1,000,000?U.S.?gal) Outer Bay exhibit for 198 days before she was released in March 2005. She was tracked for 30 days after release.[120] On the evening of 31 August 2006, the aquarium introduced a juvenile male caught outside Santa Monica Bay.[121] His first meal as a captive was a large salmon steak on 8 September 2006, and as of that date, he was estimated to be 1.72 meters (68?in) in length and to weigh approximately 47 kilograms (104?lb). He was released on 16 January 2007, after 137 days in captivity.\\r\\nMonterey Bay Aquarium housed a third great white, a juvenile male, for 162 days between 27 August 2007, and 5 February 2008. On arrival, he was 1.4?m (4.6?ft) long and weighed 30.6?kg (67?lb). He grew to 1.8?m (5.9?ft) and 64?kg (141?lb) before release. A juvenile female came to the Outer Bay Exhibit on 27 August 2008. While she did swim well, the shark fed only one time during her stay and was tagged and released on 7 September 2008. Another juvenile female was captured near Malibu on 12 August 2009, introduced to the Outer Bay exhibit on 26 August 2009, and was successfully released into the wild on 4 November 2009.[122] The Monterey Bay Aquarium added a 1.4-meter (4.6?ft) long male into their redesigned \\"Open Sea\\" exhibit on 31 August 2011. The animal was captured in the waters off of Malibu.\\r\\nOne of the largest adult great whites ever exhibited was at Japan's Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in 2016, where a 3.5 meters (11?ft) male was exhibited for three days before dying.[123][124] Probably the most famous captive was a 2.4?m (7.9?ft) female named Sandy, which in August 1980 became the only great white to be housed at the California Academy of Sciences' Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, California. She was released because she would not eat and constantly bumped against the walls.[125]\\r\\nCage diving is most common at sites where great whites are frequent including the coast of South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia,[126] and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at the focus of a booming tourist industry.[127][128] A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.\\r\\nAt present, hang baits are illegal off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive operators do not use them. Operators in South Africa and Australia continue to use hang baits and pinniped decoys.[129] In South Australia, playing rock music recordings underwater, including the AC/DC album Back in Black has also been used experimentally to attract sharks.[130]\\r\\nCompanies object to being blamed for shark bite incidents, pointing out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans.[131] Their position is that further research needs to be done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior.[132] One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.[129]\\r\\nThe shark tourist industry has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to S20,000. That is a fraction of the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between S50 and S150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between S9,000 and S27,000 of revenue daily.[133]\\r\\nPutting chum in the water\\r\\nA great white shark approaches divers in a cage off Dyer Island, Western Cape, South Africa.\\r\\nA great white shark approaches a cage","input":"When did the great white shark first appear?"},{"output":"Hiram Edson, James Springer White, Joseph Bates, and J.

Prominent figures in the early church included Hiram Edson, James Springer White, Joseph Bates, and J. N. Andrews. Over the ensuing decades the church expanded from its original base in New England to become an international organization. Significant developments such the reviews initiated by evangelicals Donald Barnhouse and Walter Martin, in the 20th century led to its recognition as a Christian denomination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Great Awakening, a revival movement in the United States, took place in the early 19th century. The Second Great Awakening was stimulated by the foundation of the many Bible Societies which sought to address the problem of a lack of affordable Bibles. The spread of Bibles allowed many who had not had one to be able to purchase and study it themselves rather than just hear it preached, and led to the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[1] Many religious minority movements formed out of the Congregational, Presbyterian, and the Baptist and Methodist churches. Some of these movements held beliefs that would later be adopted by the Seventh-day Adventists.\\r\\nAn interest in prophecy was kindled among some Protestants groups following the arrest of Pope Pius VI in 1798 by the French General Louis Alexandre Berthier. Forerunners of the Adventist movement believed that this event marked the end of the 1260-day prophecy from the Book of Daniel.[2][3][4] Certain individuals began to look at the 2300 day prophecy found in Daniel 8:14.[2] Interest in prophecy also found its way into the Roman Catholic church when an exiled Jesuit priest by the name of Manuel de Lacunza published a manuscript calling for renewed interest in the Second Coming of Christ. His publication created a stirring but was later condemned by Pope Leo XII in 1824.[2]\\r\\nAs a result of a pursuit for religious freedom, many revivalists had set foot in the United States, aiming to avoid persecution.[citation needed][5]\\r\\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church formed out of the movement known today as the Millerites. In 1831, a Baptist convert, William Miller, was asked by a Baptist to preach in their church and began to preach that the Second Advent of Jesus would occur somewhere between March 1843 and March 1844, based on his interpretation of Daniel 8:14. A following gathered around Miller that included many from the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and Christian Connection churches. In the summer of 1844, some of Miller's followers promoted the date of October 22. They linked the cleansing of the sanctuary of Daniel 8:14 with the Jewish Day of Atonement, believed to be October 22 that year. By 1844, over 100,000 people were anticipating what Miller had called the \\"Blessed Hope\\". On October 22 many of the believers were up late into the night watching, waiting for Christ to return and found themselves bitterly disappointed when both sunset and midnight passed with their expectations unfulfilled. This event later became known as the Great Disappointment.\\r\\nAfter the disappointment of October 22 many of Miller's followers were left upset and disillusioned. Most ceased to believe in the imminent return of Jesus. Some believed the date was incorrect. A few believed that the date was right but the event expected was wrong. This latter group developed into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. One of the Adventists, Hiram Edson (1806ÿ1882) wrote \\"Our fondest hopes and expectations were blasted, and such a spirit of weeping came over us as I never experienced before. It seemed that the loss of all earthly friends could have been no comparison. We wept, and wept, till the day dawn.\\"[6] On the morning of October 23, Edson, who lived in Port Gibson, New York was passing through his grain field with a friend. He later recounted his experience:\\r\\nEdson shared his experience with many of the local Adventists who were greatly encouraged by his account. As a result, he began studying the bible with two of the other believers in the area, O.R.L. Crosier and Franklin B. Hahn, who published their findings in a paper called Day-Dawn. This paper explored the biblical parable of the Ten Virgins and attempted to explain why the bridegroom had tarried. The article also explored the concept of the day of atonement and what the authors called \\"our chronology of events\\".[8][9]\\r\\nThe findings published by Crosier, Hahn and Edson led to a new understanding about the sanctuary in heaven. Their paper explained how there was a sanctuary in heaven, that Christ, the High Priest, was to cleanse. The believers understood this cleansing to be what the 2300 days in Daniel was referring to.[10]\\r\\nGeorge Knight wrote, \\"Although originally the smallest of the post-Millerite groups, it came to see itself as the true successor of the once-powerful Millerite movement.\\"[11] This view was endorsed by Ellen White. However, Seeking a Sanctuary sees it more as an offshoot of the Millerite movement.\\r\\nThe \\"Sabbath and Shut Door\\" Adventists were disparate, but slowly emerged. Only Joseph Bates had had any prominence in the Millerite movement.[12]\\r\\nAdventists viewed themselves as heirs of earlier outcast believers such as the Waldenses, Protestant Reformers including the Anabaptists, English and Scottish Puritans, evangelicals of the 18th century including Methodists, Seventh Day Baptists, and others who rejected established church traditions.[13]\\r\\nA young Seventh Day Baptist layperson named Rachel Oakes Preston living in New Hampshire was responsible for introducing Sabbath to the Millerite Adventists. Due to her influence, Frederick Wheeler, a local Methodist-Adventist preacher, began keeping the seventh day as Sabbath, probably in the early spring of 1844. Several members of the Washington, New Hampshire church he occasionally ministered to also followed his decision. These included William and Cyrus Farnsworth. T. M. Preble soon accepted it either from Wheeler or directly from Oakes. These events were shortly followed by the Great Disappointment.\\r\\nPreble promoted Sabbath through the February 28, 1845 issue of the Hope of Israel. In March he published his Sabbath views in tract form. Although he returned to observing Sunday in the next few years, his writing convinced Joseph Bates and J. N. Andrews. These men in turn convinced James and Ellen White, as well as Hiram Edson and hundreds of others.[14]\\r\\nBates proposed that a meeting should be organised between the believers in New Hampshire and Port Gibson. At this meeting, which occurred sometime in 1846 at Edson's farm, Edson and other Port Gibson believers readily accepted Sabbath and at the same time forged an alliance with Bates and two other folk from New Hampshire who later became very influential in the Adventist church, James and Ellen G. White. Between April 1848, and December 1850 twenty-two \\"Sabbath conferences\\" were held in New York and New England. These meetings were often seen as opportunities for leaders such as James White, Joseph Bates, Stephen Pierce and Hiram Edson to discuss and reach conclusions about doctrinal issues.[15]\\r\\nWhile initially it was believed that Sabbath started at 6?pm, by 1855 it was generally accepted that Sabbath begins at Friday sunset.[16]\\r\\nThe Present Truth (see below) was largely devoted to Sabbath at first. J. N. Andrews was the first Adventist to write a book-length defense of Sabbath, first published in 1861.\\r\\nAt the formation of the church in the 19th century, many of the Adventist leaders held to an antitrinitarian view. Ellen G. White never entered into debate on this issue. One study, however, sees early Adventism as well as Ellen White to espouse a materialist rather than an Arian theology.[17]\\r\\nIn 1876, James White compared Seventh-day Adventist doctrine with Seventh Day Baptists. He observed: \\"The principal difference between the two bodies is the immortality question. The S. D. Adventists hold the divinity of Christ so nearly with the trinitarian, that we apprehend no trial here...\\"[18]\\r\\nBeginning with William Miller's teachings, Adventists have played a key role in introducing the Bible doctrine of premillennialism in the United States. They believe the saints will be received or gathered by Christ into the Kingdom of God in heaven at the end of the Tribulation at the Second Coming before the millennium. In the appendix to his book \\"Kingdom of the Cults\\" where Walter Martin explains why Seventh-day Adventists are accepted as orthodox Christians (see pg 423) Martin also summarizes the key role that Adventists played in the advancement of premillennialism in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\"From the beginning, the Adventists were regarded with grave suspicion by the great majority of evangelical Christians, principally because Seventh-day Adventists were premillennial in their teaching. That is they believed that Christ would come before the millennium...Certain authors of the time considered premillennarians to be peculiar... and dubbed as 'Adventist' all who held that view of eschatology\\"\\r\\nHowever the unique contribution of Seventh-day Adventists to this doctrine does not stop there. Seventh-day Adventists are post-tribulation premillennialists who accept the Bible teaching on a literal 1000 years in Revelation 20 that immediately follows the literal second coming of Christ described in Revelation 19. In contrast to almost all premillennialist groups they do not believe in a 1000-year kingdom on earth during the millennium. In Adventist eschatology Christ's promise to take the saints to His Father's house in John 14:1ÿ3 is fulfilled at the 2nd coming where both the living and the dead saints are taken up in the air to meet the Lord (see 1Thess 4:13ÿ18 ). John, the author of Revelation, calls this moment the \\"first resurrection\\" in Revelation 20:5ÿ6. Instead of a Millennial Kingdom on earth, Adventists teach that there is only a desolated earth for 1000 years and during that time the saints are in heaven with Christ (See Jeremiah 4:23ÿ29).[19]\\r\\nOn November 18, 1848, Ellen White had a vision in which God told her that her husband should start a paper. In 1849, James, determined to publish this paper, went to find work as a farm-hand to raise sufficient funds. After another vision, she told James that he was to not worry about funds but to set to work on producing the paper to be printed. James readily obeyed, writing from the aid \\"of a pocket Bible, Cruden's Condensed Concordance, and an abridged dictionary with one of its covers off.\\" Thanks to a generous offer by the printer to delay charges, the group of Advent believers had 1000 copies of the first publication printed. They sent the publication, which was on the topic of Sabbath, to friends and colleagues they believe would find it of interest.[20][21] Eleven issues were published in 1849 and 1850.\\r\\nIn 1860, the fledgling movement finally settled on the name, Seventh-day Adventist, representative of the church's distinguishing beliefs. Three years later, on May 21, 1863, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists was formed and the movement became an official organization.\\r\\nThe first annual regional camp meeting took place September 1868.[22] Since then, the annual regional camp meeting has become a pattern among Seventh-day Adventists and is still practiced today.\\r\\nEllen G. White (1827ÿ1915), while holding no official role, was a dominant personality. She, along with her husband, James White, and Joseph Bates, moved the denomination to a concentration on missionary and medical work. Mission and medical work continues to play a central role in the 21st century.\\r\\nUnder White's guidance the denomination in the 1870s turned to missionary work and revivals, tripling its membership to 16,000 by 1880; rapid growth continued, with 75,000 members in 1901. By this time operated two colleges, a medical school, a dozen academies, 27 hospitals, and 13 publishing houses.\\r\\nBy 1945, the church reported 226,000 members in the US and Canada, and 380,000 elsewhere; the budget was $29 million and enrollment in church schools was 40,000.[23] In 1960 there were 1,245,125 members worldwide with an annual budget of over $99,900,000. Enrollment in church schools from elementary to college was 290,000 students.[24] As of the year 2000 there were 11,687,229 members worldwide. The global budget was $28,610,881,313. And the enrollment in schools was 1,065,092 students.[25] In 2008 the global membership was 15,921,408 with a budget of $45,789,067,340. The number of students in SDA run universities, secondary and primary schools was 1,538,607.[26]\\r\\nSeventh-day Adventists participated in the Temperance Movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s. During this same time, they became actively involved in promoting Religious Liberty. They had closely followed American politics, matching current events to the predictions in the Bible.\\r\\n\\"Seventh-day\\" means the observance of the original Sabbath, Saturday, is still a sacred obligation. Adventists argued that just as the rest of the Ten Commandments had not been revised, so also the injunction to \\"remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy\\" remained in full force. This theological point turned the young group into a powerful force for religious liberty. Growing into its full stature in the late 19th century and early 20th century, these Adventists opposed Sunday laws on every side. Many were arrested for working on Sunday. In fighting against the real threat of a legally established National Day of worship, these Sabbatarians had to fight for their liberty on a daily basis. Soon, they were fighting for religious liberty on a broader, less parochial basis.\\r\\nAdventist effort for a world-wide proclamation of their message began with the mailing of publications. In 1874 J. N. Andrews became the first official Adventist missionary to travel overseas. Working in Switzerland, he sought to organize the Sabbath-keeping companies under one umbrella.[27][28] During the 1890s Adventists began to enthusiastically promote a world-wide mission effort.[29]\\r\\nIn 1888, a General Conference Session occurred in Minneapolis. This session involved a discussion between the then General Conference president, G. I. Butler; editor of the review, Uriah Smith; and a group led by E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones about the meaning of \\"Righteousness by Faith\\" and the meaning of the law in Romans and Galatians. Ellen G. White also addressed the conference.\\r\\nFrom the early 1860s the church had three levels of government: the local church, the conference, and the General Conference. As ideas developed, organizations came into existence to move forward the ideas; i.e. Sabbath Schools, health reform and medical work, printing, distribution of literature, religious liberty, missions, etc. All moved forward under the societies formed to do so.[30] As the work progressed, the managing of all these societies became quite cumbersome.\\r\\nAs conferences developed in far off lands, it became obvious that the General Conference could not oversee the day-to-day needs of the conferences. This led to the development of Union conferences in Australia and Europe in the late 1890s and to the development of districts in the United States.\\r\\nThe 1901 and 1903 General Conference sessions reorganized the church's structure to include union conferences which managed a group of local conferences in their domain. By the end of 1904, the various societal interests became incorporated as departments in each conference's structure.[30]\\r\\nEllen White relates how her book Christ's Object Lessons came to be linked to the financial support of Adventist schools,\\r\\n\\"I am so thankful for the work that Christs Object Lessons has accomplished and is still accomplishing. When this book was in preparation, I expected to use the means coming from the sale of this book in preparing and publishing several other books. But the Lord put it into my mind to give this book to our schools, to be used in freeing them from debt. I asked our publishing houses to unite with me in this gift by donating the expense of the publication. This they willingly agreed to do. A fund was raised to pay for the materials used in printing the book, and canvassers and people have sold the book without commission.\\r\\n\\"Thus the book has been circulated in all parts of the world. It has been received with great favor everywhere. Ministers of all denominations have written testimonials recommending it. The Lord has prepared the way for its reception so that no fewer than 200,000 have already been sold. The means thus raised has gone far toward freeing our schools from the debts that have been accumulating for many years.\\r\\n\\"Our publishing houses have printed 300,000 copies, free of cost, and these have been distributed to the different tract societies, to be sold by our people.\\r\\n\\"The Lord has made the sale of this book a means of teaching our people how to come in touch with those not of their faith, and how to impart to them a knowledge of the truth for this time. Many have been converted by reading this book.\\"[31]\\r\\nIn 1902, those affiliated with Healdsburg College, now Pacific Union College, dedicated a week to sell Christ's Object Lessons. They first read the book together. Then each student was given six books to sell. Territories were assigned and for a week the school suspended classes in order to sell the books. The College Church took the territory immediately surrounding the church while the students were given territory further away from the school.[32]\\r\\nAfter John Andrews venture into Europe, others also went out. Some[who?] to Africa, others to Asia and others to Australasia.[citation needed]\\r\\nEllen G. White died in 1915, and Adventist leaders participated in a number of prophetic conferences during and soon after World War I. The 1919 Bible Conference looked at how Adventists interpreted Bible prophecy and the legacy of Ellen White's writings. It also had a polarizing influence on Adventist theology with leaders such as A. G. Daniells and W. W. Prescott questioning some of the traditional views held by others like Benjamin G. Wilkinson, J. S. Washburn, and Claude Holmes.\\r\\nFundamentalism was dominant in the church in the early 20th century.[33] George Knight dates it from 1919 to 1950. The edited transcripts of the 1952 Bible Conference were published as Our Firm Foundation.[34]\\r\\nWorld War II\\r\\nIn Southern Europe, as soon as the war broke out, most of the church's workers of military age were drafted. The church lost union and local conference presidents, pastors, evangelists, and institutional workers.[35]\\r\\nWhen the Nazis occupied France they dissolved the conference and all the churches, confiscated church buildings, and prohibited church work. In Croatia all Adventist churches were closed, and the conference was dissolved. All church and evangelistic work was strictly forbidden. Over in Rumania, where there were more than 25,000 Adventists, the union conference, the six local conferences, and all the churches were likewise dissolved. Over three hundred Adventist chapels, the publishing house in Bucharest, and the school at Brasov were all taken from the church. All church funds were taken. Three thousand Adventists were put in prison. They were tortured and abused.[35]\\r\\nThe work of the church went forward under creative cover. People baptized were reported as students graduating and receiving their diplomas. One minister reported on life insurance policies sold. Another reported on the harvest of 253 baskets of fruit.[35]\\r\\nIn the mid-1970s, two distinct factions were manifest within Seventh day Adventism. Defending many pre-1950 Adventist positions was conservative wing, while the more liberal Adventism emphasized beliefs of Evangelical Christianity.\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, what is now the Adventist Review carried articles by editor Kenneth Wood and associate editor Herbert Douglass wrote articles on the Questions on Doctrine issue, and articles arguing for a final perfect generation.[36] Kenneth Wood and Herbert Douglass, editors of the Review and Herald, began to emphasize views which had been the traditional views in the church before Questions on Doctrine such as sinless perfection of a final generation, which was opposed by many Progressive Adventists[37]\\r\\nThe General Conference addressed this controversy over \\"righteousness by faith\\" by holding a conference in Palmdale, California in 1976.[36] Ford was the \\"center of attention\\", and the resulting document known as the \\"Palmdale statement\\"DjVu.[38]\\r\\nThe 1980 General Conference session, held in Dallas, produced the church's first official declaration of beliefs voted by the world body, called the 27 Fundamental Beliefs. (This list of beliefs has since been expanded to the present 28 Fundamentals).\\r\\nThe year 1980 also saw a minor crisis over the investigative judgment teaching, known as the Glacier View controversy. This precipitated a controversy within the church, but the mainstream believe in the doctrine and the church reaffirmed its basic position on the doctrine,[39] although some in the church's more liberal wing continued the controversy into the 21st century.[40] Ford expressed questions on the Judgment and later requested that his membership with the Seventh-day Adventist Church be discontinued for other than doctrinal differences.\\r\\nThe year 1990 saw ordination of women reviewed at General Conference Session in Indianapolis and 1995 at General Conference Session in Utrecht, but turned down. In 2012 16 women pastors were approved for ordination in the Columbia Union Conference.[41]\\r\\nIn the new century, Adventists membership continued to increase, and worldwide, members began to use YouTube and other Internet media to communicate. These communications included video addresses from the then-president of the United States George W. Bush, and Hillary Clinton to Adventists.[42]\\r\\nA review of membership revealed an average of about 2,900 people were joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church every day, which show the denomination now has 16.6 million adult baptized members according to church statistics. Denominational membership showed strong growth and membership audits showed for 2009 as the seventh consecutive year the church had a net gain of more than one million members.[43] However, David Trim, director of the Archives, Statistics and Research department, who felt the numbers were \\"not entirely accurate,\\" said the record keeping system was not perfect and audits, would most likely result in a lower overall membership number than the 16.5 million.[44]\\r\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, retired pastor Rick Howard brought what he considered the dangers of Spiritual Formation to the attention of the Adventist church. Other Adventists such as Pastor Hal Mayer, and Derek Morris raised concerns as well. The official church paper, the Adventist Review, published articles[45] outlining the effects of spiritualism coming into the Christian Church through the teachings of Spiritual Formation.[46] Howard wrote The Omega Rebellion in which he warned of the dangers associated with the emerging church movement. He identified the teachings of Spiritual formation, contemplative prayer, postmodern spirituality, the meditation steeped in Eastern mysticism as dangerous.[47] In his July 2010 keynote sermon, Ted N.C. Wilson, newly elected President of the Seventh-Day Adventist church counseled, Stay away from non-biblical spiritual disciplines or methods of spiritual formation that are rooted in mysticism such as contemplative prayer, centering prayer, and the emerging church movement in which they are promoted. Instead, he said, believers should \\"look within the Seventh-day Adventist Church, to humble pastors, evangelists, Biblical scholars, leaders, and departmental directors who can provide evangelistic methods and programs that are based on solid Biblical principles and The Great Controversy theme.\\"\\r\\nChurch members were also cautioned to use discernment in worship styles: \\"Use Christ-centered, Bible-based worship and music practices in church services,\\" Wilson said. \\"While we understand that worship services and cultures vary throughout the world, don't go backwards into confusing pagan settings where music and worship become so focused on emotion and experience that you lose the central focus on the Word of God. All worship, however simple or complex should do one thing and one thing only: lift up Christ and put down self.\\"[48]","input":"Who is the founder of the 7th day adventist church?"},{"output":"bacteria","context":"Bubonic plague is one of three types of bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis.[1] One to seven days after exposure to the bacteria, flu like symptoms develop.[1] These include fever, headaches, and vomiting.[1] Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin.[2] Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.[1]\\r\\nThe three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague.[1] Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals.[1] It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague infected animal.[5] In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell.[1] Diagnosis is made by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.[1]\\r\\nPrevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common.[1] Vaccines have not been found to be very useful for plague prevention.[1] Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.[3][4] Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected.[1][3] Death, if it occurs, is typically within ten days.[6] With treatment the risk of death is around 10%.[3] Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~120 deaths.[1] The disease is most common in Africa.[1]\\r\\nThe plague is believed to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people.[1] This was about 25% to 60% of the European population.[1][7] Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor.[7] Some historians see this as a turning point in European economic development.[7] The term bubonic plague is derived from the Greek word ?, meaning \\"groin\\".[8] The term \\"buboes\\" is also used to refer to the swollen lymph nodes.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea, the Y. pestis bacteria become localized in an inflamed lymph node where they begin to colonize and reproduce. Buboes associated with the bubonic plague are commonly found in the armpits, upper femoral, groin and neck region. Acral gangrene (i.e., of the fingers, toes, lips and nose) is another common symptom.\\r\\nBecause of its bite-based mode of transmission, the bubonic plague is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly a few days after exposure to the bacterium. Symptoms include:\\r\\nOther symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood (hematemesis), aching limbs, coughing, and extreme pain caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive. Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, lenticulae (black dots scattered throughout the body), delirium, and coma.\\r\\nBubonic plague is an infection of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The flea is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remained harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply.\\r\\nY. pestis bacilli can resist phagocytosis and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, the lymph nodes can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.\\r\\nLaboratory testing is required in order to diagnose and confirm plague. Ideally, confirmation is through the identification of Y. pestis culture from a patient sample. Confirmation of infection can be done by examining serum taken during the early and late stages of infection. To quickly screen for the Y. pestis antigen in patients, rapid dipstick tests have been developed for field use.[12]\\r\\nSeveral classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1ÿ15%, compared to a mortality of 40ÿ60% in untreated cases.[13]\\r\\nPeople potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. Other treatments include oxygen, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics.[14] Using the broad-based antibiotic streptomycin has proven to be dramatically successful against the bubonic plague within 12 hours of infection.[15]\\r\\nThe first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.[16] [17] The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence).[18][19] The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. In the spring of 542, the plague arrived in Constantinople, working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea, later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy. Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinians efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies, his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague. Procopius, in his work Secret History, declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness.[19]\\r\\nIn the Late Middle Ages (1340ÿ1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population.[where?] Some historians believe that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.[20] The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia. Chinese records also showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s.[21] Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea.[15] In late 1346, plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another.\\r\\nThere were many ethno-medical beliefs for avoiding the Black Death. One of the most famous was that by walking around with flowers in or around their nose people would be able to \\"ward off the stench and perhaps the evil that afflicted them\\". People believed the plague to be a punishment from God, and that the only way to be rid of the plague was to be forgiven by God.[22] One such method used was to carve the symbol of the cross onto the front door of a house with the words \\"Lord have mercy on us\\".[23]\\r\\nPistoia, a city in Italy, went as far as enacting rules and regulations on the city and its inhabitants to keep it safe from the Black Death. The rules stated that no one was allowed to visit any plague-infected area and if they did they were not allowed back into the city. Some other rules were that no linen or woollen goods were to be imported into the city and no corpses were to be buried in the city. Despite strict enforcement of the rules, the city eventually became infected.[24] People who were not infected with the plague gathered in groups and stayed away from the sick. They ate and drank with limited food and water and were not even allowed oral communication because it was believed that merely talking with one another increased the chance of passing on the disease.[25]\\r\\nWhile Europe was devastated by the disease, the rest of the world fared much better. In India, population rose from a population of 91 million in 1300, to 97 million in 1400, to 105 million in 1500. Sub-Saharan Africa remained largely unaffected by the plagues.[26]\\r\\nThe next few centuries were marked by several localized or regional outbreaks of lesser severity. The Great Plague of Milan (1629ÿ1631), the Great Plague of Seville (1647), the Great Plague of London (1665ÿ1666), the Great Plague of Vienna (1679), Great Baltic plague (1708ÿ1712), the Great Plague of Marseille (1720), the Great Plague of 1738, and Caragea's Plague (1813ÿ1814) were the last major outbreaks of the bubonic plague in Europe.\\r\\nMedieval doctors thought the plague was created by air corrupted by humid weather, decaying unburied bodies, and fumes produced by poor sanitation. The recommended treatment of the plague was a good diet, rest, and relocating to a non-infected environment so the individual could get access to clean air. This did help, but not for the reasons the doctors of the time thought. In actuality, because they recommended moving away from unsanitary conditions, people were, in effect, getting away from the rodents that harbored the fleas carrying the infection. However, this also helped to spread the infection to new areas previously non-infected.\\r\\nThe plague resurfaced for a third time in the mid-19th century. Like the two previous outbreaks, this one also originated in Eastern Asia.[27] The initial outbreak occurred in China's Yunnan province in 1855.[28] The disease remained localized in Southwest China for several years before spreading. In the city of Canton, beginning in January 1894, the disease killed 80,000 people by June. Daily water-traffic with the nearby city of Hong Kong rapidly spread the plague there, killing over 2,400 within two months.[29]\\r\\nFrom China, the plague spread to the Indian subcontinent around 1896. Over the next thirty years, India would lose 12.5 million people to the bubonic plague. The disease was initially seen in port cities, beginning with Bombay (now Mumbai), but later emerged in Poona (now Pune), Kolkata, and Karachi (now in Pakistan). By 1899, the outbreak spread to smaller communities and rural areas in many regions of India. Overall, the impact of plague epidemics was greatest in western and northern Indiain the provinces then designated as Bombay, Punjab, and the United Provinceswhile eastern and southern India were not as badly affected. Ultimately, more than 12 million people died from the plague in India (including present day Pakistan and Bangladesh) and China alone.\\r\\nIn 1899, the plague reached the islands of Hawaii.[30] The first evidence of the disease was found in Honolulu's Chinatown on Oahu.[31] It was located very close to the island's piers, and rats in cargo ships from China were able to land on the Hawaiian islands unseen. As the rats, hosts for disease-carrying fleas, made their way deeper into the city, people started to fall ill. On December 12, 1899, the first case was confirmed. The Board of Health then quickly thought of ways to prevent the disease from spreading even further inland. Their solution was to burn down any buildings in Chinatown suspected of containing a source of the disease. On December 31, 1899, the board set the first fire. They had originally planned to burn only a few targeted buildings, and thought they could control the flames as each building was finished, but the fire got out of control, burning down untargeted neighboring buildings. The resulting fire caused many of Chinatown's homes to be destroyed and an estimated 4,000 people were left homeless.[32]\\r\\nAustralia suffered 12 major plague outbreaks between 1900 and 1925 originating from shipping.[33] Research by Australian medical officers Thompson, Armstrong and Tidswell contributed to understanding the spread of Yersinia pestis to humans by fleas from infected rats.[34]\\r\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the pandemic was considered active until 1959, when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year. In 1994, a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections (including 52 deaths) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague.\\r\\nThe scale of death and social upheaval associated with plague outbreaks has made the topic prominent in a number of historical and fictional accounts since the disease was first recognized. The Black Death in particular is described and referenced in numerous contemporary sources, some of which, including works by Chaucer, Boccaccio, and Petrarch, are considered part of the Western canon. The Decameron, by Boccaccio, is notable for its use of a frame story involving individuals who have fled Florence for a secluded villa to escape the Black Death. First person, sometimes sensationalized or fictionalized, accounts of living through plague years have also been popular across centuries and cultures.\\r\\nLater works, such as Albert Camus's novel The Plague or Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal have used bubonic plague in settings, such quarantined cities in either medieval or modern times, as a backdrop to explore a variety of concepts. Common themes include the breakdown of society, institutions, and individuals during the plague, the cultural and psychological existential confrontation with mortality, and the allegorical use of the plague in reference to contemporary moral or spiritual questions.\\r\\nSome of the earliest instances of biological warfare were said to have been products of the plague, as armies of the 14th century were recorded catapulting diseased corpses over the walls of towns and villages to spread the pestilence.\\r\\nLater, plague was used during the Second Sino-Japanese War as a bacteriological weapon by the Imperial Japanese Army. These weapons were provided by Shir Ishii's units and used in experiments on humans before being used on the field. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague.[35] During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials, the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks.[36]","input":"Is the bubonic plague a bacteria or virus?"},{"output":"375 units","context":"The McLaren P1 is a British limited-production plug-in hybrid sports car produced by McLaren. Debuted at the 2012 Paris Motor Show,[4] retail began in the UK in October 2013 and[5] all 375 units were sold out by November.[6] Production ended in December 1 2015.[7] The United States accounted for 34% of the units and Europe for 26%.[7]\\r\\nIt is considered to be the successor to the F1, utilising hybrid power and Formula 1 technology, but does not have the same three-seat layout as its predecessor. Like the F1, the P1 is a mid-engine, rear wheel drive design that used a carbon fibre monocoque and roof structure safety cage concept called MonoCage, which is a development of the MonoCell first used in the MP4-12C and then in subsequent models. Its main competitors were the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918. They are all similar in specifications and performance, and in a race around Silverstone circuit they were all within half a second of each other, the P1 finishing first at 58.24 sec and the LaFerrari finishing last at 58.58 sec; the 918 was in-between with 58.46 sec.[8]\\r\\nA track-focused version of the P1, the P1 GTR, was unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. Production of the GTR was limited to 40 cars.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe P1 features a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine.[10] The twin turbos boost the petrol engine at 1.4 bar to deliver 727?bhp (737?PS; 542?kW) and 531?lb?ft (720?N?m) of torque at 7,500 rpm, combined with an in-house-developed electric motor producing 176?bhp (178?PS; 131?kW) and 192?lb?ft (260?N?m). With both engine and the electric motor, the P1 has a total power and torque output of 903?bhp (916?PS; 673?kW) and 723?lb?ft (980?N?m) of torque. The electric motor can be deployed manually by the driver or left in automatic mode, whereby the car's ECUs 'torque fill' the gaps in the petrol engine's output, which is considered turbo lag. This gives the powertrain an effective powerband of almost 7,000 rpm.[11] The car is rear-wheel-drive with a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox developed by Graziano.\\r\\nPower for the electric motor is stored in a 324-cell lithium-ion high-density battery pack located behind the cabin, developed by Johnson Matthey Battery Systems. The battery can be charged by the engine or through a plug-in equipment and can be fully charged in two hours. The car can be operated using either the petrol engine, the electric motor or with a combination of the two. The P1 has an all-electric range of at least 10?km (6.2?mi) on the combined European drive cycle.[12] Under the EPA cycle, the range in EV mode is 19?mi (31?km). During EV mode the P1 has a petrol consumption of 4.8g/100?mile, and as a result, EPA's all-electric range is rated as zero. The total range is 330?mi (530?km).[1] The P1 combined fuel economy in EV mode was rated by the EPA at 18 MPGe (13 L petrol equivalent/100?km; 22 mpg-imp petrol equivalent), with an energy consumption of 25?kW-hrs/100?mi and petrol consumption of 4.8 gal-US/100?mi. The combined fuel economy when running only with petrol is 17?mpg?US (14?L/100?km; 20?mpg?imp), 16?mpg?US (15?L/100?km; 19?mpg?imp) for city driving, and 20?mpg?US (12?L/100?km; 24?mpg?imp) in highway.[1][13]\\r\\nThe P1 has Formula 1 derived features such as the Instant Power Assist System (IPAS), which gives an instant boost in acceleration via the electric motor, a Drag Reduction System (DRS) which operates the car's rear wing, thereby increasing straight line speed, and a KERS. Both of these features (IPAS, DRS) are operated via two buttons on the steering wheel. It also generates a downforce of 600?kg at 160?mph[14] and it boasts of drag coefficient of only 0.34.[15]\\r\\nAccording to McLaren the P1 accelerates from 0ÿ62?mph (0ÿ100?km/h) in 2.8 seconds, 0ÿ200?km/h (0ÿ124?mph) in 6.8 seconds, and 0ÿ300?km/h (0ÿ186?mph) in 16.5 seconds, making it a full 5.5 seconds faster than the F1, and a standing quarter mile is claimed in 9.8 seconds at 152?mph (245?km/h).[16] Autocar tested 0ÿ60?mph (0ÿ97?km/h) mph in 2.8 seconds, 0ÿ120?mph (0ÿ193?km/h) mph in 6.9 seconds, and the standing mile in 18.2 seconds at 178.5?mph (287?km/h).[17] The P1 is electronically limited to a top speed of 217?mph (350?km/h). The P1 has a dry weight of 1,395?kg (3,075?lb), giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 647?bhp/tonne. It has a kerb weight of 1,547?kg (3,411?lb)[18] which translates to 593?bhp/?tonne. Actual kerb weight (full tank of fuel, no luggage or people) of US-spec vehicles is 3411?lb. The P1 also features bespoke Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tyres and specially developed carbon-ceramic brakes from Akebono.[19] According to McLaren it takes 6.2 seconds to brake from 186?mph (300?km/h) to standstill, during which it will cover 246 metres. From 97?km/h (60?mph), it will cover 30.2 metres.[2]\\r\\nThe production version of the McLaren P1 was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show.[20] Production was strictly limited to 375 units which, according to McLaren, is to maintain exclusivity. Pricing started at GBS866,000 (?1,030,000 or US$1,350,000)[21] but, as of November?2013[update], about 75% of P1 customers opted for some level of unique design from McLaren Special Operations, raising the average sale price of a P1 above GBS1 million (?1.2 million or US$1.6 million).[6]\\r\\nIn August 2013 McLaren announced that the production allocation destined to the Americas, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East was sold out.[22] The cars destined for Europe were sold out by mid November 2013.[6] The United States accounted for 34% of the limited production run, and Europe for 26%.[7]\\r\\nAfter some delays, production began in October 2013.[23] Hand-assembled by a team of 61 engineers, at a production rate of one car per day McLaren production was planned for fifty P1s by the end of 2013.[24] The first delivery to a retail customer took place at the company's headquarters in Woking, England, in October 2013,[5] with 12 units manufactured by mid November 2013.[6] The first P1 delivery in the U.S. occurred in May 2014.[25] The production run ended in December 2015.[7]\\r\\nAccording to JATO Dynamics, only twenty units had been registered worldwide during the first nine months of 2014.[26] A total of 12 P1s were registered in Switzerland during 2014,[27] and an additional five units between January and August 2015.[28] About 59 units were delivered in the U.S. in 2014,[29] and sales in the American market totalled about 127 units delivered through December 2015.[7]\\r\\nCelebrating 20 years since their victory in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, McLaren announced that they would resurrect the GTR name by launching a track-only version of the P1, the P1 GTR.\\r\\nProduction of the P1 GTR was limited to 40 units, initially only available to P1 owners. The concept car made its debut at the 2014 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August 2014. The P1 GTR production model was officially unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. The GTR variant is priced at GBS1.9 million.[30] This price includes a worldwide owners trackday series; later P1 GTRs were offered for less money, approximately GBS1.3 million, for those P1 owners who had no interest in the track series but still wanted to purchase the GTR variant.\\r\\nThe P1 GTR went into production in 2015, after all 375 standard P1's had been built, as a homage to its race-winning ancestor, the iconic F1 GTR and were built, maintained and run by McLaren Special Operations.[31]\\r\\nThe P1 GTR's hybrid engine aims to produce 986?bhp (1,000?PS; 735?kW), representing an 83?bhp (84?PS; 62?kW) increase over the standard production P1, although McLaren did not disclose whether the power increase is from electrical boost or tuning the twin turbo 3.8-litre V8. Performance figures remain unconfirmed.[32] The weight of the P1 GTR was reduced by 50?kg (110?lb), achieving a power-to-weight ratio of 687?bhp (697?PS; 512?kW) per 1 tonne (1.1 tons).[33] This equates to a weight-to-power ratio of 1.44?kg (3.17?lb) per brake horsepower. The car also featured slick tyres, and had greater levels of performance, grip, aerodynamics and downforce in comparison to the road car. Featuring a new fixed ride height on race-prepared suspension, a fixed rear wing capable of using DRS, and a new exclusively designed exhaust, McLaren's target was to deliver the ultimate track experience\\r\\nThe P1 GTR can accelerate from 0-60?mph in just 2.4 seconds, and will go on to reach a top speed of 225?mph (362?km/h). Additionally, the P1 GTR will brake from 60?mph to 0 in 85?ft, and can corner at 1.54 G.\\r\\nIn late 2015, historic racing team and McLaren F1 specialists Lanzante started undergoing road conversions of P1 GTRs for owners who wanted to drive their cars on the road. Thus far, 27 P1 GTRs have been converted for road use by Lanzante.\\r\\nWith the production run of P1 GTRs having been built and sold, and prompted by their efforts in converting track-only spec P1 GTRs to road-legal spec variants, Lanzante Motorsport commissioned Mclaren Special Operations' Bespoke division to build a further total 6 new P1 GTRs for them to develop into road-legal P1 LM variants.[34] Of this production run, five P1 LMs have been sold and the sixth, the prototype P1 LM, XP1 LM, has been retained and is being used for development and testing. To make them into P1 LM spec, Lanzante Motorsport developed these P1 GTRs by, amongst other modifications, making changes to the drivetrain hardware (to increase power), by employing a modified rear wing and larger front splitter and dive planes (to improve downforce) and by removing the air-jack system and using Inconel catalytic converter pipes and exhaust headers, lightweight fabricated charge coolers, Lexan windows, lighter seats (from the F1 GTR) and titanium exhausts, bolts and fixings (to save weight).[35]\\r\\nAt the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed, the prototype P1 LM, XP1 LM, set the fastest ever time for a road car up the Goodwood hillclimb, with a time of 47.07 seconds, driven by Kenny Br?ck.\\r\\nOn 27 April 2017, the prototype P1 LM, XP1 LM, continued its success on track, beating the road car lap record time at the Nrburgring Nordschleife, with a time of 6:43.22 using road legal Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tyres but without front number plate required to be road legal. This time was once again set by Kenny Br?ck, and announced on 26 May 2017.\\r\\nMcLaren announced a sub-seven minute lap of the Nrburgring Nordschleife, which equates to an average speed in excess of 179?km/h (111?mph), but did not publish the exact time.[36][37] However, the P1 LM, which wasn't road legal during the run, beat the road car record time at the Nordschleife with a time of 6:43.22.\\r\\nThe P1 currently holds the production car lap record at Circuit of the Americas,[38] Algarve International Circuit,[39] Anglesey Coastal Circuit[40] and Silverstone National Circuit.[41][42]","input":"How many mclaren p1 are there in the world?"},{"output":"depend on the magnitude of the g-force, the length of time it is applied, the direction it acts, the location of application, and the posture of the body","context":"The g-force (with g from gravitational) is a measurement of the type of acceleration that causes a perception of weight. Despite the name, it is incorrect to consider g-force a fundamental force, as \\"g-force\\" (lower case character) is a type of acceleration that can be measured with an accelerometer. Since g-force accelerations indirectly produce weight, any g-force can be described as a \\"weight per unit mass\\" (see the synonym specific weight). When the g-force acceleration is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object, the reaction-force to this push produces an equal and opposite weight for every unit of an object's mass. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. The g-force acceleration (save for certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free-fall.[1][2]\\r\\nThe g-force acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all non-gravitational and non-electromagnetic forces acting on an object's freedom to move. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may be destructive.\\r\\nGravitation acting alone does not produce a g-force, even though g-forces are expressed in multiples of the acceleration of a standard gravity. Thus, the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface produces g-force only indirectly, as a result of resistance to it by mechanical forces. These mechanical forces actually produce the g-force acceleration on a mass. For example, the 1?g force on an object sitting on the Earth's surface is caused by mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground, keeping the object from going into free-fall. The upward contact-force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earth's surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition. (Free fall is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earth's center). Stress inside the object is ensured from the fact that the ground contact forces are transmitted only from the point of contact with the ground.\\r\\nObjects allowed to free-fall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitation only, feel no g-force acceleration, a condition known as zero-g (which means zero g-force). This is demonstrated by the \\"zero-g\\" conditions inside a freely falling elevator falling toward the Earth's center (in vacuum), or (to good approximation) conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit. These are examples of coordinate acceleration (a change in velocity) without a sensation of weight. The experience of no g-force (zero-g), however it is produced, is synonymous with weightlessness.\\r\\nIn the absence of gravitational fields, or in directions at right angles to them, proper and coordinate accelerations are the same, and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding g-force acceleration. An example here is a rocket in free space, in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines, and produce g-forces on the rocket and passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit of measure of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI) is m/s2. However, to distinguish acceleration relative to free-fall from simple acceleration (rate of change of velocity), the unit g (or g) is often used. One g is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface and is the standard gravity (symbol: gn), defined as 7000980665000000000?9.80665 metres per second squared,[3] or equivalently 7000980665000000000?9.80665 newtons of force per kilogram of mass. Note that the unit definition does not vary with locationthe g-force when standing on the moon is about 0.181 g.\\r\\nThe unit g is not one of the SI units, which uses \\"g\\" for gram. Also, \\"g\\" should not be confused with \\"G\\", which is the standard symbol for the gravitational constant.[4] This notation is commonly used in aviation, especially in aerobatic or combat military aviation, to describe the increased forces that must be overcome by pilots in order to remain conscious and not G-LOC (G-induced loss of consciousness).[5]\\r\\nMeasurement of g-force is typically achieved using an accelerometer (see discussion below in Measuring g-force using an accelerometer). In certain cases, g-forces may be measured using suitably calibrated scales. Specific force is another name that has been used for g-force.\\r\\nThe term g-force is technically incorrect as it is a measure of acceleration, not force. While acceleration is a vector quantity, g-force accelerations (\\"g-forces\\" for short) are often expressed as a scalar, with positive g-forces pointing downward (indicating upward acceleration), and negative g-forces pointing upward. Thus, a g-force is a vector acceleration. It is an acceleration that must be produced by a mechanical force, and cannot be produced by simple gravitation. Objects acted upon only by gravitation, experience (or \\"feel\\") no g-force, and are weightless.\\r\\nG-forces, when multiplied by a mass upon which they act, are associated with a certain type of mechanical force in the correct sense of the term force, and this force produces compressive stress and tensile stress. Such forces result in the operational sensation of weight, but the equation carries a sign change due to the definition of positive weight in the direction downward, so the direction of weight-force is opposite to the direction of g-force acceleration:\\r\\nThe reason for the minus sign is that the actual force (i.e., measured weight) on an object produced by a g-force is in the opposite direction to the sign of the g-force, since in physics, weight is not the force that produces the acceleration, but rather the equal-and-opposite reaction force to it. If the direction upward is taken as positive (the normal cartesian convention) then positive g-force (an acceleration vector that points upward) produces a force/weight on any mass, that acts downward (an example is positive-g acceleration of a rocket launch, producing downward weight). In the same way, a negative-g force is an acceleration vector downward (the negative direction on the y axis), and this acceleration downward produces a weight-force in a direction upward (thus pulling a pilot upward out of the seat, and forcing blood toward the head of a normally oriented pilot).\\r\\nIf a g-force (acceleration) is vertically upward and is applied by the ground (which is accelerating through space-time) or applied by the floor of an elevator to a standing person, most of the body experiences compressive stress which at any height, if multiplied by the area, is the related mechanical force, which is the product of the g-force and the supported mass (the mass above the level of support, including arms hanging down from above that level). At the same time, the arms themselves experience a tensile stress, which at any height, if multiplied by the area, is again the related mechanical force, which is the product of the g-force and the mass hanging below the point of mechanical support. The mechanical resistive force spreads from points of contact with the floor or supporting structure, and gradually decreases toward zero at the unsupported ends (the top in the case of support from below, such as a seat or the floor, the bottom for a hanging part of the body or object). With compressive force counted as negative tensile force, the rate of change of the tensile force in the direction of the g-force, per unit mass (the change between parts of the object such that the slice of the object between them has unit mass), is equal to the g-force plus the non-gravitational external forces on the slice, if any (counted positive in the direction opposite to the g-force).\\r\\nFor a given g-force the stresses are the same, regardless of whether this g-force is caused by mechanical resistance to gravity, or by a coordinate-acceleration (change in velocity) caused by a mechanical force, or by a combination of these. Hence, for people all mechanical forces feels exactly the same whether they cause coordinate acceleration or not. For objects likewise, the question of whether they can withstand the mechanical g-force without damage is the same for any type of g-force. For example, upward acceleration (e.g., increase of speed when going up or decrease of speed when going down) on Earth feels the same as being stationary on a celestial body with a higher surface gravity. Gravitation acting alone does not produce any g-force; g-force is only produced from mechanical pushes and pulls. For a free body (one that is free to move in space) such g-forces only arise as the \\"inertial\\" path that is the natural effect of gravitation, or the natural effect of the inertia of mass, is modified. Such modification may only arise from influences other than gravitation.\\r\\nExamples of important situations involving g-forces include:\\r\\nA classic example of negative g-force is in a fully inverted roller coaster which is accelerating (changing velocity) toward the ground. In this case, the roller coaster riders are accelerated toward the ground faster than gravity would accelerate them, and are thus pinned upside down in their seats. In this case, the mechanical force exerted by the seat causes the g-force by altering the path of the passenger downward in a way that differs from gravitational acceleration. The difference in downward motion, now faster than gravity would provide, is caused by the push of the seat, and it results in a g-force toward the ground.\\r\\nAll \\"coordinate accelerations\\" (or lack of them), are described by Newton's laws of motion as follows:\\r\\nThe Second Law of Motion, the law of acceleration states that: F =?ma., meaning that a force F acting on a body is equal to the mass m of the body times its acceleration a.\\r\\nThe Third Law of Motion, the law of reciprocal actions states that: all forces occur in pairs, and these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Newton's third law of motion means that not only does gravity behave as a force acting downwards on, say, a rock held in your hand but also that the rock exerts a force on the Earth, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\\r\\nIn an airplane, the pilots seat can be thought of as the hand holding the rock, the pilot as the rock. When flying straight and level at 1?g, the pilot is acted upon by the force of gravity. His weight (a downward force) is 725 newtons (163?lbf). In accordance with Newtons third law, the plane and the seat underneath the pilot provides an equal and opposite force pushing upwards with a force of 725?N (163?lbf). This mechanical force provides the 1.0 g-force upward proper acceleration on the pilot, even though this velocity in the upward direction does not change (this is similar to the situation of a person standing on the ground, where the ground provides this force and this g-force).\\r\\nIf the pilot were suddenly to pull back on the stick and make his plane accelerate upwards at 9.8?m/s2, the total g?force on his body is 2?g, half of which comes from the seat pushing the pilot to resist gravity, and half from the seat pushing the pilot to cause his upward accelerationa change in velocity which also is a proper acceleration because it also differs from a free fall trajectory. Considered in the frame of reference of the plane his body is now generating a force of 1,450?N (330?lbf) downwards into his seat and the seat is simultaneously pushing upwards with an equal force of 1,450?N (330?lbf).\\r\\nUnopposed acceleration due to mechanical forces, and consequentially g-force, is experienced whenever anyone rides in a vehicle because it always causes a proper acceleration, and (in the absence of gravity) also always a coordinate acceleration (where velocity changes). Whenever the vehicle changes either direction or speed, the occupants feel lateral (side to side) or longitudinal (forward and backwards) forces produced by the mechanical push of their seats.\\r\\nThe expression \\"1 g = 7000980665000000000?9.80665?m/s2\\" means that for every second that elapses, velocity changes 7000980665000000000?9.80665 meters per second (7000980665000000000?35.30394?km/h). This rate of change in velocity can also be denoted as 7000980665000000000?9.80665 (meter per second) per second, or 7000980665000000000?9.80665?m/s2. For example: An acceleration of 1?g equates to a rate of change in velocity of approximately 35 kilometres per hour (22?mph) for each second that elapses. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of braking at 1?g and is traveling at 35 kilometres per hour (22?mph) it can brake to a standstill in one second and the driver will experience a deceleration of 1?g. The automobile traveling at three times this speed, 105?km/h (65?mph), can brake to a standstill in three seconds.\\r\\nIn the case of an increase in speed from 0 to v with constant acceleration within a distance of s this acceleration is v2/(2s).\\r\\nPreparing an object for g-tolerance (not getting damaged when subjected to a high g-force) is called g-hardening.[citation needed] This may apply to, e.g., instruments in a projectile shot by a gun.\\r\\nHuman tolerances depend on the magnitude of the g-force, the length of time it is applied, the direction it acts, the location of application, and the posture of the body.[7][8]:350\\r\\nThe human body is flexible and deformable, particularly the softer tissues. A hard slap on the face may briefly impose hundreds of g locally but not produce any real damage; a constant 16?g for a minute, however, may be deadly. When vibration is experienced, relatively low peak g levels can be severely damaging if they are at the resonance frequency of organs or connective tissues.\\r\\nTo some degree, g-tolerance can be trainable, and there is also considerable variation in innate ability between individuals. In addition, some illnesses, particularly cardiovascular problems, reduce g-tolerance.\\r\\nAircraft pilots (in particular) sustain g-forces along the axis aligned with the spine. This causes significant variation in blood pressure along the length of the subject's body, which limits the maximum g-forces that can be tolerated.\\r\\nPositive, or \\"upward\\" g, drives blood downward to the feet of a seated or standing person (more naturally, the feet and body may be seen as being driven by the upward force of the floor and seat, upward around the blood). Resistance to positive g varies. A typical person can handle about 5?g0 (49?m/s2) (meaning some people might pass out when riding a higher-g roller coaster, which in some cases exceeds this point) before losing consciousness, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain musclesboth of which act to force blood back into the brainmodern pilots can typically handle a sustained 9?g0 (88?m/s2) (see High-G training)[citation needed].\\r\\nIn aircraft particularly, vertical g-forces are often positive (force blood towards the feet and away from the head); this causes problems with the eyes and brain in particular. As positive vertical g-force is progressively increased (such as in a centrifuge) the following symptoms may be experienced:\\r\\nResistance to \\"negative\\" or \\"downward\\" g, which drives blood to the head, is much lower. This limit is typically in the ?2 to ?3?g0 (?20 to ?29?m/s2) range. This condition is sometimes referred to as red out where vision is figuratively reddened[11] due to the blood laden lower eyelid being pulled into the field of vision[12] Negative g is generally unpleasant and can cause damage. Blood vessels in the eyes or brain may swell or burst under the increased blood pressure, resulting in degraded sight or even blindness.\\r\\nThe human body is better at surviving g-forces that are perpendicular to the spine. In general when the acceleration is forwards (subject essentially lying on their back, colloquially known as \\"eyeballs in\\"[13]) a much higher tolerance is shown than when the acceleration is backwards (lying on their front, \\"eyeballs out\\") since blood vessels in the retina appear more sensitive in the latter direction[citation needed].\\r\\nEarly experiments showed that untrained humans were able to tolerate a range of accelerations depending on the time of exposure. This ranged from as much as 20?g for less than 10 seconds, to 10?g for 1 minute, and 6?g for 10 minutes for both eyeballs in and out.[14] These forces were endured with cognitive facilities intact, as subjects were able to perform simple physical and communication tasks. The tests were determined to not cause long or short term harm although tolerance was quite subjective, with only the most motivated non-pilots capable of completing tests.[15] The record for peak experimental horizontal g-force tolerance is held by acceleration pioneer John Stapp, in a series of rocket sled deceleration experiments culminating in a late 1954 test in which he was clocked in a little over a second from a land speed of Mach 0.9. He survived a peak \\"eyeballs-out\\" acceleration of 46.2 times the acceleration of gravity, and more than 25?g for 1.1 seconds, proving that the human body is capable of this. Stapp lived another 45 years to age 89[16] without any ill effects.[17]\\r\\nThe highest recorded G-force experienced by a human who survived was during the 2003 IndyCar Series finale at Texas Motor Speedway in the 2003 Chevy 500 when the car driven by Kenny Br?ck made wheel-to-wheel contact with Tomas Scheckter's car. This immediately resulted in Kenny's car impacting the catch fence that would record a peak of 214 G-force. [18][19]\\r\\nImpact and mechanical shock are usually used to describe a high kinetic energy, short term excitation. A shock pulse is often measured by its peak acceleration in g-s and the pulse duration. Vibration is a periodic oscillation which can also be measured in g-s as well as frequency. The dynamics of these phenomena are what distinguish them from the g-forces caused by a relatively longer term accelerations.\\r\\nAfter a free fall from a height \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\r\\n\\r\\n the shock on an object during impact is \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h/d}\\r\\n\\r\\n g, where \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle d}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the distance covered during the impact. For example, a stiff and compact object dropped from 1 m that impacts over a distance of 1?mm is subjected to a 1000 g deceleration.\\r\\nJerk is the rate of change of acceleration. In SI units, jerk is expressed as m/s3; it can also be expressed in standard gravity per second (g/s; 1 g/s  9.81 m/s3).\\r\\nRecent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria including E. coli and Paracoccus denitrificans being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627?g. Paracoccus denitrificans was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually only to be found in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful growth under hypergravity. The research has implications on the feasibility of panspermia.[20][21]\\r\\n* Including contribution from resistance to gravity.\\r\\n? Directed 40 degrees from horizontal.\\r\\nAn accelerometer, in its simplest form, is a damped mass on the end of a spring, with some way of measuring how far the mass has moved on the spring in a particular direction, called an 'axis'.\\r\\nAccelerometers are often calibrated to measure g-force along one or more axes. If a stationary, single-axis accelerometer is oriented so that its measuring axis is horizontal, its output will be 0?g, and it will continue to be 0?g if mounted in an automobile traveling at a constant velocity on a level road. When the driver presses on the brake or gas pedal, the accelerometer will register positive or negative acceleration.\\r\\nIf the accelerometer is rotated by 90 so that it is vertical, it will read +1?g upwards even though stationary. In that situation, the accelerometer is subject to two forces: the gravitational force and the ground reaction force of the surface it is resting on. Only the latter force can be measured by the accelerometer, due to mechanical interaction between the accelerometer and the ground. The reading is the acceleration the instrument would have if it were exclusively subject to that force.\\r\\nA three-axis accelerometer will output zero?g on all three axes if it is dropped or otherwise put into a ballistic trajectory (also known as an inertial trajectory), so that it experiences \\"free fall,\\" as do astronauts in orbit (astronauts experience small tidal accelerations called microgravity, which are neglected for the sake of discussion here). Some amusement park rides can provide several seconds at near-zero g. Riding NASA's \\"Vomit Comet\\" provides near-zero g for about 25 seconds at a time.","input":"How much g force can a person with stand?"},{"output":"July 20, 1871","context":"","input":"When did british columbia became part of canada?"},{"output":"a system of latitude and longitude","context":"The history of longitude is a record of the effort, by astronomers, cartographers and navigators over several centuries, to discover a means of determining longitude.\\r\\nThe measurement of longitude is important to both cartography and navigation, in particular to provide safe ocean navigation. Knowledge of both latitude and longitude was required. Finding an accurate and reliable method of determining longitude took centuries of study, and involved some of the greatest scientific minds in human history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEratosthenes in the 3rd century BC first proposed a system of latitude and longitude for a map of the world. By the 2nd century BC Hipparchus was the first to use such a system to uniquely specify places on the earth. He also proposed a system of determining longitude by comparing the local time of a place with an absolute time. This is the first recognition that longitude can be determined by accurate knowledge of time. In the 11th century Al-Biruni believed the earth rotated on its axis and this forms our modern notion of how time and longitude are related.[1]\\r\\nDetermining latitude was relatively easy in that it could be found from the altitude of the sun at noon (i.e. at its highest point) with the aid of a table giving the sun's declination for the day, or from many stars at night. For longitude, early ocean navigators had to rely on dead reckoning. This was inaccurate on long voyages out of sight of land and these voyages sometimes ended in tragedy as a result.\\r\\nDetermining longitude at sea was also much harder than on land. A stable surface to work from, a comfortable location to live in while performing the work, and the ability to repeat determinations over time made various astronomical techniques possible on land (such as the observation of eclipses) that were unfortunately impractical at sea. Whatever could be discovered from solving the problem at sea would only improve the determination of longitude on land.\\r\\nIn order to avoid problems with not knowing one's position accurately, navigators have, where possible, relied on taking advantage of their knowledge of latitude. They would sail to the latitude of their destination, turn toward their destination and follow a line of constant latitude. This was known as running down a westing (if westbound, easting otherwise).[2] This prevented a ship from taking the most direct route (a great circle) or a route with the most favourable winds and currents, extending the voyage by days or even weeks. This increased the likelihood of short rations,[3] which could lead to poor health or even death for members of the crew due to scurvy or starvation, with resultant risk to the ship.\\r\\nErrors in navigation have also resulted in shipwrecks. Motivated by a number of maritime disasters attributable to serious errors in reckoning position at sea, particularly such spectacular disasters as the Scilly naval disaster of 1707, which took Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell and his fleet, the British government established the Board of Longitude in 1714:\\r\\n\\"The Discovery of the Longitude is of such Consequence to Great Britain for the safety of the Navy and Merchant Ships as well as for the improvement of Trade that for want thereof many Ships have been retarded in their voyages, and many lost...\\" [and there will be a Longitude Prize] \\"for such person or persons as shall discover the Longitude.\\"\\r\\nThe prizes were to be awarded for the discovery and demonstration of a practical method for determining the longitude of a ship at sea. Prizes were offered in graduated amounts for solutions of increasing accuracy. These prizes, worth the equivalent of millions of pounds in today's currency, motivated many to search for a solution.\\r\\nBritain was not alone in the desire to solve the problem. France's King Louis XIV founded the Acadmie Royale des Sciences in 1666. It was charged with, among a range of other scientific activities, advancement of the science of navigation and the improvement of maps and sailing charts. From 1715, the Acadmie offered one of the two Prix Rouills specifically for navigation.[4] Spain's Philip II offered a prize for the discovery of a solution to the problem of the longitude in 1567; Philip III increased the prize in 1598. Holland added to the effort with a prize offered in 1636.[1] Navigators and scientists in most European countries were aware of the problem and were involved in finding a solution. Due to the international effort in solving the problem and the scale of the enterprise, it represented one of the largest scientific endeavours in history.\\r\\nSince the Earth rotates at a steady rate of 360 per day, or 15 per hour (in mean solar time), there is a direct relationship between time and longitude. If the navigator knew the time at a fixed reference point when some event occurred at the ship's location, the difference between the reference time and the apparent local time would give the ship's position relative to the fixed location. Finding apparent local time is relatively easy. The problem, ultimately, was how to determine the time at a distant reference point while on a ship.\\r\\nThe first publication of a method of determining time by observing the position of the Earth's moon was by Johannes Werner in his In hoc opere haec continentur Nova translatio primi libri geographiae Cl. Ptolomaei, published at Nuremberg in 1514. The method was discussed in detail by Petrus Apianus in his Cosmographicus liber (Landshut 1524).\\r\\nIt appears that Johannes Werner inspired by Amerigo Vespucci's letter written in 1502 where he wrote: \\"...I maintain that I learned [my longitude] ... by the eclipses and conjunctions of the Moon with the planets; and I have lost many nights of sleep in reconciling my calculations with the precepts of those sages who have devised the manuals and written of the movements, conjunctions, aspects, and eclipses of the two luminaries and of the wandering stars, such as the wise King Don Alfonso in his Tables, Johannes Regiomontanus in his Almanac, and Blanchinus, and the Rabbi Zacuto in his almanac, which is perpetual; and these were composed in different meridians: King Don Alfonso's book in the meridian of Toledo, and Johannes Regiomontanus's in that of Ferrara, and the other two in that of Salamanca.\\"2 The best \\"clock\\" to use for reference, is the stars. In the roughly 27.3 solar days of a lunar orbit, the Moon moves a full 360 degrees around the sky, returning to its old position among the stars. This is 13 degrees per day, or just over 0.5 degree per hour. So, while the rotation of the Earth causes the stars and the Moon to appear to move from east to west across the night sky, the Moon, because of its own orbit around the Earth, fights back against this apparent motion, and seems to move eastward (or retrograde) by about 0.5 degree per hour. In other words, the Moon \\"moves\\" west only 11.5 degrees per day.\\"\\r\\nIn 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's four brightest satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto), Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits one could use their positions as a universal clock, which would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life.\\r\\nTo be successful, this method required the observation of the moons from the deck of a moving ship. To this end, Galileo proposed the celatone, a device in the form of a helmet with a telescope mounted so as to accommodate the motion of the observer on the ship.[5] This was later replaced with the idea of a pair of nested hemispheric shells separated by a bath of oil. This would provide a platform that would allow the observer to remain stationary as the ship rolled beneath him, in the manner of a gimballed platform. To provide for the determination of time from the observed moons' positions, a Jovilabe was offered  this was an analogue computer that calculated time from the positions and that got its name from its similarities to an astrolabe.[6] The practical problems were severe and the method was never used at sea. However, it was used for longitude determination on land.\\r\\nAround 1683, Edmund Halley proposed using a telescope to observe the time of occultations or appulses of a star by the moon as a means of determining time while at sea.[7] He had accumulated observations of the moon's position and of certain stars to this end, and had deduced the means of correcting errors in predictions of the moon's position.\\r\\nUpon succeeding John Flamsteed in the post of Astronomer Royal, Halley had undertaken the task of observing both stellar positions and the path of the moon, with the intention of supplementing existing knowledge and advancing his proposal for determining longitude at sea.[7] By this time, he had abandoned the use of occultations in preference for appulses exclusively. No reason was given by Halley for abandoning occultations. However, there are few bright stars occulted by the moon, and the task of documenting the dim stars' positions and training navigators to recognize them would be daunting. Appulses with brighter stars would be more practical.\\r\\nWhile he had tested the method at sea, it was never widely used or considered as a viable method. His observations did contribute to the lunar distance method.\\r\\nHalley also hoped that careful observations of magnetic deviations could provide a determination of longitude. The magnetic field of the Earth was not well understood at the time. Mariners had observed that magnetic north deviated from geographic north in many locations. Halley and others hoped that the pattern of deviation, if consistent, could be used to determine longitude. If the measured deviation matched that recorded on a chart, the position would be known. Halley used his voyages on the pink Paramour to study the magnetic variance and was able to provide maps showing the halleyan or isogonic lines. This method was eventually to fail as the localized variations from general magnetic trends make the method unreliable.\\r\\nA Frenchman, the Sieur de St. Pierre, brought Werner's technique to the attention of King Charles II of England in 1674.[8] Being enthusiastic for the proposed technique, the king contacted his royal commissioners, who included Robert Hooke. They in turn consulted the astronomer John Flamsteed. Flamsteed supported the feasibility of the method but lamented the lack of detailed knowledge of the stellar positions and the moon's movement. At the same time, Sir Jonas Moore had suggested to King Charles the establishment of an observatory and proposed Flamsteed as the first Astronomer Royal. With the creation of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich and a program for measuring the positions of the stars with high precision, the process of gathering the data for a working method of lunar distances was under way.[9] To further the astronomers' ability to predict the moon's motion, Isaac Newton soon pubished his theory of gravitation, which could be applied to the motion of the moon.\\r\\nIn 1755, Tobias Mayer, the German astronomer and superintendent of the observatory at G?ttingen, who had been working on a method to determine accurately positions on land based on lunar distances, sent a proposal to the Admiralty. He had corresponded with Leonhard Euler, who contributed information and equations to describe the motions of the moon.[10] Based on this work, Mayer had produced a set of tables predicting the position of the Moon more accurately than ever before. The Admiralty passed them on to the Board of Longitude for evaluation and consideration for the Longitude Prize. James Bradley, the Astronomer Royal at that time, evaluated the tables, and found their predictions to be accurate to within half a degree. The calculations themselves, however, were extremely laborious and time-consuming.\\r\\nA decade later, Nevil Maskelyne, who as the newly appointed Astronomer Royal was on the Board of Longitude, armed with Mayer's tables and after his own experiments at sea trying out the lunar distance method, proposed annual publication of pre-calculated lunar distance predictions in an official nautical almanac for the purpose of finding longitude at sea.\\r\\nBeing very enthusiastic for the lunar distance method, Maskelyne and his team of computers worked feverishly through the year 1766, preparing tables for the new Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris. Published first with data for the year 1767, it included daily tables of the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets and other astronomical data, as well as tables of lunar distances giving the distance of the Moon from the Sun and nine stars suitable for lunar observations (ten stars for the first few years).[11] [12] This publication later became the standard almanac for mariners worldwide. Since it was based on the Royal Observatory, it helped lead to the international adoption a century later of the Greenwich Meridian as an international standard.\\r\\nAnother proposed solution was to use a mechanical timepiece, to be carried on a ship, that would maintain the correct time at a reference location. The concept of using a clock can be attributed to Gemma Frisius. Attempts had been made on land using pendulum clocks, with some success. In particular, Huygens had made accurate pendulum clocks that made it possible to determine longitude on land. He also proposed the use of a balance spring to regulate clocks. There is some dispute as to whether he or Robert Hooke first proposed this idea.[13] However, many, including Isaac Newton, were pessimistic that a clock of the required accuracy could ever be developed. At that time, there were no clocks that could maintain accurate time while being subjected to the conditions of a moving ship. The rolling, pitching and yawing, coupled with the pounding of wind and waves, would knock existing clocks out of the correct time.\\r\\nIn spite of this pessimism, a group felt that the answer lay in chronometrydeveloping an improved time piece that would work even on extended voyages at sea. A suitable timepiece was eventually built by John Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter, with his marine chronometer; that timepiece was later known as H-4.\\r\\nHarrison built five, two of which were tested at sea. His first, H-1, was not tested under the conditions that were required by the Board of Longitude. Instead, the Admiralty required that it travel to Lisbon and back. It performed excellently, but the perfectionist in Harrison prevented him from sending it on the required trial to the West Indies. He instead embarked on the construction of H-2. This chronometer never went to sea, and was immediately followed by H-3. Still not satisfied with his own work, Harrison produced H-4, which did get its sea trial and satisfied all the requirements for the Longitude Prize. However, he was not awarded the prize and was forced to fight for his reward.\\r\\nThough the British Parliament rewarded John Harrison for his marine chronometer in 1773, his chronometers were not to become standard. Chronometers such as those by Thomas Earnshaw were suitable for general nautical use by the middle of the 19th century (1836).[14] However, they remained very expensive and the lunar distance method continued to be used for some decades.\\r\\nThe lunar distance method was initially labour-intensive because of the time-consuming complexity of the calculations for the Moon's position. Early trials of the method could involve four hours of effort.[9] However, the publication of the Nautical Almanac starting in 1767 provided tables of pre-calculated distances of the Moon from various celestial objects at three-hour intervals for every day of the year, making the process practical by reducing the time for calculations to less than 30 minutes and as little as ten minutes with some efficient tabular methods.[15] Lunar distances were widely used at sea from 1767 to about 1905. With the new tables with Haversines from Josef de Mendoza y Ros (1805), computation time was reduced to a few minutes.\\r\\nBetween 1800 and 1850 (earlier in British and French navigation practice, later in American, Russian, and other maritime countries), affordable, reliable marine chronometers became available, with a trend to replace the method of lunars as soon as they could reach the market in large numbers. It became possible to buy three or more chronometers, serving for checking on each other (redundancy), although according to Nathaniel Bowditch, their use was precluded because they were very expensive, [16] obviously much higher than a single sextant of sufficient quality for lunar distance navigation which continued in use until 1906.[17]\\r\\nTwo chronometers provided dual modular redundancy, allowing a backup if one should cease to work, but not allowing any error correction if the two displayed a different time, since in case of contradiction between the two chronometers, it would be impossible to know which one was wrong (the error detection obtained would be the same of having only one chronometer and checking it periodically: every day at noon against dead reckoning). Three chronometers provided triple modular redundancy, allowing error correction if one of the three was wrong, so the pilot would take the average of the two with closer readings (average precision vote). There is an old adage to this effect, stating: \\"Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.\\"[18] At one time this observation or rule was an expensive one as the cost of three sufficiently accurate chronometers was more than the cost of many types of smaller merchant vessels.[19] Some vessels carried more than three chronometers ÿ for example, the HMS Beagle carried 22 chronometers.[20]\\r\\nBy 1850, the vast majority of ocean-going navigators worldwide had ceased using the method of lunar distances. Nonetheless, expert navigators continued to learn lunars as late as 1905, though for most this was a textbook exercise since they were a requirement for certain licenses. They also continued in use in land exploration and mapping where chronometers could not be kept secure in harsh conditions. The British Nautical Almanac published lunar distance tables until 1906 and the instructions until 1924.[21] Such tables last appeared in the 1912 USNO Nautical Almanac, though an appendix explaining how to generate single values of lunar distances was published as late as the early 1930s.[12] The presence of lunar distance tables in these publications until the early 20th century does not imply common usage until that time period but was simply a necessity due to a few remaining (soon to be obsolete) licensing requirements. The development of wireless telegraph time signals in the early 20th century, used in combination with marine chronometers, put a final end to the use of lunar distance tables.\\r\\nTime signals were first broadcast by wireless telegraphy in 1904, by the US Navy from Navy Yard in Boston. Another regular broadcast began in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1907, and time signals that became more widely used were broadcast from the Eiffel Tower starting in 1910.[22] As ships adopted radio telegraph sets for communication, such time signals were used to correct chronometers. This method drastically reduced the importance of lunars as a means of verifying chronometers.\\r\\nModern sailors have a number of choices for determining accurate positional information, including radar and the Global Positioning System, commonly known as GPS, a satellite navigation system. With technical refinements that make position fixes accurate to within meters, the radio-based LORAN system was used in the late 20th Century but has been discontinued in North America. Combining independent methods is used as a way to improve the accuracy of position fixes. Even with the availability of multiple modern methods of determining longitude, a marine chronometer and sextant are routinely carried as a backup system.\\r\\nFor the determination of longitude on land, the preferred method became exchanges of chronometers between observatories to accurately determine the differences in local times in conjunction with observation of the transit of stars across the meridian.\\r\\nAn alternative method was the simultaneous observation of occultations of stars at different observatories. Since the event occurred at a known time, it provided an accurate means of determining longitude. In some cases, special expeditions were mounted to observe a special occultation or eclipse to determine the longitude of a location without a permanent observatory.\\r\\nFrom the mid-19th century, telegraph signalling allowed more precisely synchronization of star observations. This significantly improved longitude measurement accuracy. The Royal Observatory in Greenwich and the U.S. Coast Survey coordinated European and North American longitude measurement campaigns in the 1850s and 1860s, resulting in improved map accuracy and navigation safety. Synchronization by radio followed in the early 20th century. In the 1970s, the use of satellites was developed to more precisely measure geographic coordinates (GPS).\\r\\nIn the process of searching for a solution to the problem of determining longitude, many scientists added to the knowledge of astronomy and physics.","input":"How did the early explorers determine local time?"},{"output":"Mahindra Tractors","context":"Mahindra Tractors is an international farm equipment manufacturer of Mahindra & Mahindra.[1] In 2010, Mahindra became the world's highest-selling tractor brand by volume.

With an estimated population of 9.4 million people, it is the third largest metropolitan area in the United States.[2]\\r\\nThe Chicago metropolitan area is one of the worlds largest and most diversified economies, with more than four million employees and generating an annual gross regional product (GRP) of over $561 billion. The region is home to more than 400 major corporate headquarters, including 31 in the Fortune 500.[3]\\r\\nThere are several definitions of the area, including the area defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and the area under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) (a metropolitan planning organization).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) was originally designated by the United States Census Bureau in 1950. It comprised the Illinois counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and Will, along with Lake County in Indiana. As surrounding counties saw an increase in their population densities and the number of their residents employed within Cook County, they met Census criteria to be added to the MSA. The Chicago MSA, now defined as the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, is the third largest MSA by population in the United States. The 2015 census estimate for the MSA was 9,532,569, a decline from 9,543,893 in the 2014 census estimate.[4] This loss of population has been attributed to taxes, political issues, and other factors.[5]\\r\\nThe Chicago MSA is further subdivided by state boundaries into the Chicago-Naperville-Joliet, IL Metropolitan Division, corresponding roughly to the CMAP region; the Gary, IN Metropolitan Division consisting of the Indiana counties of Lake and Porter, as well as two surrounding counties; and the Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI Metropolitan Division.\\r\\nA breakdown of the 2009 estimated populations of the three Metropolitan Divisions of the MSA are as follows:[6]\\r\\nThe OMB also defines a slightly larger region as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI Combined Statistical Area combines the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Michigan City (in Indiana), and Kankakee (in Illinois). This area represents the extent of the labor market pool for the entire region. The CSA has a population of 9,928,312 (2014 estimate).[2]\\r\\nThe Chicago urban agglomeration, according to the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects report (2011 revision), lists a population of 9,545,000.[7] The term urban agglomeration refers to the population contained within the contours of a contiguous territory inhabited at urban density levels. It usually incorporates the population in a city plus that in the surrounding area.\\r\\nChicagoland is an informal name for the Chicago metropolitan area. The term Chicagoland has no official definition, and the region is often considered to include areas beyond the corresponding MSA, as well as portions of the greater CSA.[citation needed]\\r\\nColonel Robert R. McCormick, editor and publisher of the Chicago Tribune, usually gets credit for placing the term in common use.[9][10] McCormick's conception of Chicagoland stretched all the way to nearby parts of four states (Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa).[9] The first usage was in the Tribune's July 27, 1926 front page headline, \\"Chicagoland's Shrines: A Tour of Discoveries\\", for an article by reporter James O'Donnell Bennett.[11] He stated that Chicagoland comprised everything in a 200-mile (320?km) radius in every direction and reported on many different places in the area. The Tribune was the dominant newspaper in a vast area stretching to the west of the city, and that hinterland was closely tied to the metropolis by rail lines and commercial links.[12]\\r\\nToday, the Chicago Tribune's usage includes the city of Chicago, the rest of Cook County, eight nearby Illinois counties (Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee), and the two Indiana counties of Lake and Porter.[13] Illinois Department of Tourism literature uses Chicagoland for suburbs in Cook, Lake, DuPage, Kane, and Will counties,[14] treating the city separately. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce defines it as all of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties.[15]\\r\\nDiffering viewpoints exist, of course. For example, many residents who live in some of the more distant satellite counties nonetheless refer to themselves as being \\"from Chicago\\" or \\"Chicagoans\\". Until recently[when?], DeKalb County was not considered part of the region proper, but as the highly developed area has continued to expand, it is now commonly defined as the \\"far suburbs\\" of the city.[original research?][citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition, company marketing programs such as Construction Data Company's[16] \\"Chicago and Vicinity\\" region and the Chicago Automobile Trade Association's \\"Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana\\" advertising campaign are directed at the MSA itself, as well as LaSalle, Winnebago (Rockford), Boone, and Ogle counties in Illinois, in addition to Jasper, Newton, and La Porte counties in Indiana and Kenosha, Racine, and Walworth counties in Wisconsin, and even as far northeast as Berrien County, Michigan. The region is part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis, containing an estimated 54 million people.[citation needed]\\r\\nChicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) is an Illinois state agency responsible for transportation infrastructure, land use, and long term economic development planning for the areas under its jurisdiction within Illinois.[17] The planning area has a population of over 8 million, which includes the following locations in Illinois:[18]\\r\\nThe city of Chicago lies in the Chicago Plain, a flat and broad area characterized by little topographical relief. The few low hills are sand ridges. North of the Chicago Plain, steep bluffs and ravines run alongside Lake Michigan.\\r\\nAlong the southern shore of the Chicago Plain, sand dunes run alongside the lake. The tallest dunes reach up to near 200 feet (61?m) and are found in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Surrounding the low plain are bands of moraines in the south and west suburbs. These areas are higher and hillier than the Chicago Plain. A continental divide, separating the Mississippi River watershed from that of the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, runs through the Chicago area.\\r\\nA 2012 survey of the urban trees and forests in the seven county Illinois section of the Chicago area found that 21% of the land is covered by the tree and shrub canopy, made up of about 157,142,000 trees. The five most common tree species are buckthorn, green ash, boxelder, black cherry, and American elm. These resources perform important functions in carbon storage, water recycling, and energy saving.[19][20]\\r\\nAs of the 2010 Census, the metropolitan area had a population of 9,729,825. The population density was 1,318 per square mile. The racial makeup was 52.8% Non-Latino White, 22.1% were Latino, 16.7% were Non-Latino African Americans, and 6.4% were Asian. Other ethnic groups such as Native Americans and Pacific Islanders made up just 2.0% of the population. [21] The suburbs, surrounded by easily annexed flat ground, have been expanding at a tremendous rate since the early 1960s. Aurora, Elgin, Joliet, and Naperville are noteworthy for being four of the few boomburbs outside the Sun Belt, West Coast and Mountain States regions, and exurban Kendall County ranked as the fastest-growing county (among counties with a population greater than 10,000) in the United States between the years 2000 and 2007.[22]\\r\\nSettlement patterns in the Chicago metropolitan area tend to follow those in the city proper: the northern suburbs along the shore of Lake Michigan are comparatively affluent, while the southern suburbs (sometimes known as Chicago Southland) are less so, with lower median incomes and a lower cost of living. However, there is a major exception to this. While Chicago's West Side is the poorest section of the city, the western and northwestern suburbs contain many affluent areas. According to the 2000 Census, DuPage County had the highest median household income of any county in the Midwestern United States.\\r\\nAccording to the 2000 U.S. Census, poverty rates of the largest counties from least poverty to most are as follows: McHenry 3.70%, Dupage 5.9%, Will 6.7%, Lake 6.9%, Kane 7.4%, Cook 14.5%.\\r\\nIn an in-depth historical analysis, Keating (2004, 2005) examined the origins of 233 settlements that by 1900 had become suburbs or city neighborhoods of the Chicago metropolitan area. The settlements began as farm centers (41%), industrial towns (30%), residential railroad suburbs (15%), and recreational/institutional centers (13%). Although relations between the different settlement types were at times contentious, there also was cooperation in such undertakings as the construction of high schools.\\r\\nAs the Chicago metropolitan area has grown, more counties have been partly or totally assimilated with the taking of each decennial census.\\r\\nCounties highlighted in gray were not included in the MSA for that census. The CSA totals in blue are the totals of all the counties listed above, regardless of whether they were included in the Chicago Combined Statistical Area at the time.[23]\\r\\nWithin the boundary of the 16-county Chicago Consolidated Statistical Area lies the Chicago urban area, as well as 27 smaller urban areas and clusters.

In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois's earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market.\\r\\nIn 2007, the area ranked first among U.S. metro areas in the number of new and expanded corporate facilities.[26] It ranked third in 2008, behind the HoustonÿSugar LandÿBaytown and DallasÿFort Worth metropolitan areas,[27] and ranked second behind the New York metropolitan area in 2009.[28]\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal summarized the Chicago area's economy in November 2006 with the comment that \\"Chicago has survived by repeatedly reinventing itself.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn addition to the Chicago Loop, the metro area is home to a few important subregional corridors of commercial activities.

Racial inequalities in education in the region remain widespread, often breaking along district boundaries;[32] for instance, educational prospects vary widely for students in the Chicago Public Schools compared to those in some neighboring suburban schools.[33]\\r\\nHistorically, the Chicago metropolitan area has been at the center of a number of national educational movements, from the free-flowing Winnetka Plan to the regimented Taylorism of the Gary Plan.[34] In higher education, University of Chicago founder William Rainey Harper was a leading early advocate of the junior college movement; Joliet Junior College is the nation's oldest continuously-operating junior college today.[35] Later U of C president Robert Maynard Hutchins was central to the Great Books movement, and programs of dialogic education arising from that legacy can be found today at the U of C, at Shimer College,[36] and in the City Colleges of Chicago and Oakton Community College in the Northwest suburbs.[37]\\r\\nFrom 1947 until 1988, the Illinois portion of the Chicago metro area was served by a single area code, 312, which abutted the 815 area code. In 1988 the 708 area code was introduced and the 312 area code became exclusive to the city of Chicago.\\r\\nIt became common to call suburbanites \\"708'ers\\", in reference to their area code.\\r\\nThe 708 area code was partitioned in 1996 into three area codes, serving different portions of the metro area: 630, 708, and 847.\\r\\nAt the same time that the 708 area code was running out of phone numbers, the 312 area code in Chicago was also exhausting its supply of available numbers. As a result, the city of Chicago was divided into two area codes, 312 and 773. Rather than divide the city by a north/south area code, the central business district retained the 312 area code, while the remainder of the city took the new 773 code.\\r\\nIn 2002, the 847 area code was supplemented with the overlay area code 224. In February 2007, the 815 area code (serving outlying portions of the metro area) was supplemented with the overlay area code 779. In October 2007, the overlay area code 331 was implemented to supplement the 630 area with additional numbers.\\r\\nPlans are in place for overlay codes in the 708, 773, and 312 regions as those area codes become exhausted in the future.\\r\\nCoordinates: 4154N 8739W? / ?41.900N 87.650W? / 41.900; -87.650","input":"What's the population of the greater chicago area?"},{"output":"14,910,352","context":"","input":"What is the population of karachi in 2017?"},{"output":"February 1861","context":"","input":"When were the confederate states of america formed?"},{"output":"May 1848","context":"\\"The Bells\\" is a heavily onomatopoeic poem by Edgar Allan Poe which was not published until after his death in 1849. It is perhaps best known for the diacopic use of the word \\"bells.\\" The poem has four parts to it; each part becomes darker and darker as the poem progresses from \\"the jingling and the tinkling\\" of the bells in part 1 to the \\"moaning and the groaning\\" of the bells in part 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis poem can be interpreted in many different ways, the most basic of which is simply a reflection of the sounds that bells can make, and the emotions evoked from that sound. For example, \\"From the bells bells bells bells/Bells bells bells!\\" brings to mind the clamoring of myriad church bells. Several deeper interpretations exist as well. One is that the poem is a representation of life from the nimbleness of youth to the pain of age. Growing despair is emphasized alongside the growing frenzy in the tone of the poem.[1] Another is the passing of the seasons, from spring to winter. The passing of the seasons is often used as a metaphor for life itself. The poem also suggests a Poe theme of mourning over a lost wife, courted in sledge, married and then killed in a fire as the husband looks on. The tolling of the iron bells reflects the final madness of the grief-stricken husband.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe sounds of the verses, specifically the repetitive \\"bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells,\\" lie on a narrow line between sense and nonsense, causing a feeling of instability.[2] Poe uses the word \\"tintinnabulation\\", apparently a coinage of his own, based on the Latin word for \\"bell\\", tintinnabulum.[3] The series of \\"bells\\" echo the imagined sounds of the various bells, from the silver bells following the klip-klop of the horses, to the \\"dong, ding-dong\\" of the swinging golden and iron bells, to screeching \\"whee-aaah\\" of the brazen bells. The series are always four, followed by three, always beginning and ending on a stressed syllable. The meter changes to iambic in the lines with repeated \\"bells,\\" bringing the reader into their rhythm. Most of the poem is a more hurried trochaic tetrameter.[4]\\r\\nThe bells of which he writes are thought to be those he heard from Fordham University's bell tower, since Poe resided in the same neighborhood as that university. He also frequently strolled about Fordham's campus conversing with both the students and the Jesuits.[5]\\r\\nAccording to Poe biographer Jeffrey Meyers, \\"The Bells\\" is often criticized for being mechanical and forced.[6]\\r\\nPoe is believed to have written \\"The Bells\\" in May 1848 and submitted it three times to Sartain's Union Magazine, a magazine run by John Sartain, until it was finally accepted.[7] He was paid fifteen dollars for his work, though it was not published until after his death in the November 1849 issue. It was also published in the New York Tribune on the front page of its October 20, 1849 issue as \\"Poe's Last Poem\\".\\r\\nInspiration for the poem is often granted to Marie Louise Shew, a woman who had helped care for Poe's wife Virginia as she lay dying.[7] One day, as Shew was visiting Poe at his cottage in Fordham, New York, Poe needed to write a poem but had no inspiration. Shew allegedly heard ringing bells from afar and playfully suggested to start there, possibly even writing the first line of each stanza.[8]\\r\\nSergei Rachmaninoff (1873ÿ1943) composed a choral symphony The Bells, Op. 35, based on a Russian adaptation of the poem by Konstantin Balmont. The symphony follows classical sonata form: first movement, slow movement, scherzo, and finale, thus honoring the poem's four sections.[9] (The work is sometimes performed in English, using not Poe's original, but a translation of Balmont's adaptation by Fanny S. Copeland.) The Scottish composer Hugh S. Roberton (1874ÿ1947) published \\"Hear the Tolling of the Bells\\" (1909), \\"The Sledge Bells\\" (1909), and \\"Hear the Sledges with the Bells\\" (1919) based on Poe's poem.[10] Josef Holbrooke composed his \\"The Bells, Prelude, Op. 50\\" on Poe's poem, and American folksinger Phil Ochs composed a tune to the poem recorded on his album All the News That's Fit to Sing.\\r\\nEric Woolfson, musical partner to Alan Parsons in the Alan Parsons Project, has written two albums based on the writings of Poe. His second, Poe: More Tales of Mystery and Imagination includes a song entitled \\"The Bells\\", for which he set Poe's words to music. This album was also the basis for a musical stage production that was performed in England, Austria, and other European countries. Pink Floyd have referenced the poem in the last verse of their song \\"Time\\" on the album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In 1993 Danish composer Poul Ruders wrote a piece \\"The Bells\\" for high soprano and ten instruments, using Poe's text in its entirety although in Dutch.[11] The piece was premiered in London, and has appeared on a CD from Bridge Records, New York.

Spanish for \\"Saint Rose\\") is a city in and the county seat of Sonoma County, in California's Wine Country.[10] Its estimated 2016 population was 175,155.[11] Santa Rosa is the largest city in California's Redwood Empire,   Wine Country and the North Bay; the fifth most populous city in the San Francisco Bay Area after San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, and Fremont; and the 28th most populous city in California.\\r\\n\\r\\n Santa Rosa was founded in 1833 and named after Saint Rose of Lima.  Before the arrival of Europeans, the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of Pomo natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day Spring Lake Regional Park. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Pomos were decimated by smallpox brought from Europe, and by the eradication efforts of Anglo settlers. By 1900 the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first known permanent European settlement of Santa Rosa was the homestead of the Carrillo family, in-laws to Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, who settled the Sonoma pueblo and Petaluma area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of Mara L܇pez de Carrillo built an adobe house on their Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. Allegedly, however, by the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, Spanish and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south raised livestock in the area and slaughtered animals at the fork of the Santa Rosa Creek and Matanzas Creek, near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa Avenue and Sonoma Avenue. This is supposedly the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek as, because of its use as a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called La Matanza.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1850s, a Wells Fargo post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a public square in the center, a pattern which largely remains as the street pattern for downtown Santa Rosa to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an incorporated city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and Healdsburg, incorporated in 1867.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Census records, among others, show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily early on, despite initially lagging behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. According to the U.S. Census, in 1870 Santa Rosa was the eighth largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. According to a 1905 article in the Press Democrat newspaper reporting on the \\"Battle of the Trains\\", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamed director Alfred Hitchcock filmed his thriller Shadow of a Doubt in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist due to major reconstruction following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. However, some, like the rough-stone Northwestern Pacific Railroad depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower), still survive.  A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present day Old Courthouse square); the KRESS building on Fourth Street is also visible. However, the courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' 2001 film The Man Who Wasn't There is set in Santa Rosa c. 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa grew following World War II because it was the location for Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa, the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the Russian River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population increased by 2/3 between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20 years. Some of the increase was from immigration, and some from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958 the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included American Samoa, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for civil defense activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense's 69-year history.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the City Council adopted the city's first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a yeartriple the average growth during the previous twenty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa 2010, the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city's urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa's \\"ultimate\\" boundary. The rapid growth that was being criticized as urban sprawl became routine infill development.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first five-year update of the plan, in 1996, the Council extended the planning period by ten years, renaming it Vision 2020 (updated to Santa Rosa 2020, and then again to Santa Rosa 2030 Vision), and added more land and population. Now the City projects a population of 195,000 in 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa annexed the community of Roseland in November 2017.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning on the night of October 8, 2017, five percent of the city's homes were destroyed in the Tubbs Fire, a 45,000-acre wildfire that claimed the lives of at least 19 people in Sonoma County.[15] Named after its origin near Tubbs Lane and Highway 128 in northeast Sonoma County, the fire became a major section of the most destructive and third deadliest firestorm in California history.[16][17][18] Most homes in the Coffey Park and Fountain Grove neighborhoods were destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA notable exception to the destruction in the area was the protection of more than 1000 animals at the renowned Safari West Wildlife Preserve northeast of Santa Rosa. All of the preserve's animals were saved by owner Peter Lang, who, at age 76, single-handedly fought back the flames for more than 10 hours using garden hoses.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire burned strong for over 7 days, bringing the largest aerial attack in history to Sonoma County skies.[citation needed] Some of the airplanes include a massive Boeing 747 Supertanker, a C-130, S-2, OV-10, DC-10 Air Tanker UH-60 Blackhawk, and Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter.[citation needed] Every police agency in the San Francisco Bay Area was called in to help.[citation needed] Fire fighting crews from across California and as far away as Australia came to aid in extinguishing the fire.[citation needed] The fires, alongside the December 2017 Southern California wildfires, comprised the most destructive year of California wildfires on record.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 9, 1878, Charles Henley, a 57-year-old farmer from Windsor, California, murdered his neighbor James Rowland after Rowland complained about Henley's pigs being loose on his property. Henley left Rowland's body to be eaten by his hogs, and the next day Henley turned himself in to the authorities. In the early morning hours of June 9, groups of men started to appear on the streets of Santa Rosa. One group went to the home of jailer Sylvester Wilson, where the men held his family hostage while Wilson was taken to the jail to hand over the keys to the lynch mob. Wilson and night guard R. Dryer were taken in a wagon and dropped off on the outskirts of Santa Rosa. Henley was found hanging from a tree not far from where the two men were released. The lynchers were never caught.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 5, 1920, Santa Rosa native Terry Fitts, along with San Francisco hoodlums \\"Spanish\\" Charley Valento and George Boyd, got into a shootout with a joint police squad from Santa Rosa, Sonoma County and the San Francisco Police department. The outlaws were wanted in San Francisco for the gang rape of a young woman. Fitts, Valento, and Boyd were at the home of an acquaintance, looking for food or money, when the police caught up with them. As the police crashed through the door of the home, Boyd shot and killed San Francisco police detective Lester Dohrman, Sergeant Miles Jackson, and Sonoma County Sheriff Jim Petray. The three wanted men were then quickly taken into custody. On December 10, 1920, a group of men entered the jail without a struggle, took the men out of their cell, and drove them to Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery.  They were strung up by their necks in their long underwear and left to swing in the wind. The inquest's verdict was \\"death by persons unknown\\". It was rumored that the lynch mob was made up of men from nearby Healdsburg, California who were friends of Sheriff Petray.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 15, 1935, disgruntled rancher and hunting guide Al Chamberlain dressed up in his finest cowboy clothes, drove to his former ranch outside of Santa Rosa and shot John McCabe, the new owner of the property, leaving him for dead.  He survived.  Chamberlain drove his beat-up car to Santa Rosa where he walked into the Santa Rosa police station and killed Chief Charlie O'Neal.  Chamberlain had owned a livery stable in downtown Santa Rosa for years, but was forced to vacate his business through eminent domain when the city wanted to build their new city hall on Chamberlain's property.  Chief O'Neal personally signed and served Chamberlain his notice to vacate.  Financially broken, Chamberlain had to sell his beloved ranch on Saint Helena Road.  O'Neal continued to harass Chamberlain to the point where he got the prosecutor to sentence Chamberlain to thirty days and a hundred-dollar fine for accidentally hitting a pedestrian. He was never the same man after he was released from jail.  After shooting O'Neal, Chamberlain calmly walked down the street with a pistol in each hand, searching for Sonoma County Sheriff Harry Patteson.  Patteson heard the gunshots and bumped into Chamberlain, who did not recognize him.  Patteson disarmed and tackled Chamberlain, with the help of Joe Schurman and Burnette Dibble.  He was sentenced to life in prison and died in San Quentin Prison.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, 13-year-old Andy Lopez was shot and killed by Sonoma County sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus in the Moorland neighborhood of Santa Rosa. Lopez was walking to his friend's house while carrying an airsoft gun replica of an AK-47. Gelhaus mistook the airsoft gun for a real rifle, and demanded that Lopez drop the weapon. Gelhaus then fired eight shots at Lopez, killing him. The shooting prompted protests in Santa Rosa, which attracted protesters from around Northern California.[22] The Lopez family filed a lawsuit at the District Court in November, claiming that Gelhaus shot Lopez \\"without reasonable cause.\\"[23][24] They amended their lawsuit in January 2014, claiming that the Sheriff's office had long known that Gelhaus had a \\"propensity ... to recklessly draw his firearm and to use excessive force\\". The deputy's attorney argued that Gelhaus \\"absolutely believed\\" that the gun was real and that his life was in danger.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 41.50?sq?mi (107.5?km2), of which 41.29?sq?mi (106.9?km2) is land and 0.205?sq?mi (0.5?km2) (0.49%) is water.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is part of the North Bay region, which includes such cities as Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Windsor, and smaller cities as Sonoma, Healdsburg, Sebastopol. It lies along the US Route 101 corridor, approximately 55 miles (89?km) north of San Francisco, via the Golden Gate Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa lies on the Santa Rosa Plain. The city's eastern extremities stretch into the Valley of the Moon, and the Sonoma Creek watershed known as the Sonoma Valley. The city's western edge lies in the Laguna de Santa Rosa catchment basin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is in the watershed of Santa Rosa Creek, which rises on Hood Mountain and discharges to the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Tributary basins to Santa Rosa Creek lying significantly in the city are Brush Creek, Matanzas Creek, and Piner Creek. Other water bodies within the city include Fountaingrove Lake, Lake Ralphine, and Santa Rosa Creek Reservoir.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prominent visual features east of the city include Bennett Peak, Mount Hood, and Sonoma and Taylor Mountains.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K?ppen Csb) with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. In the summer, fog and low overcast often move in from the Pacific Ocean during the evenings and mornings. They usually clear up to warm, sunny weather by late morning or noon before returning in the later evening but will occasionally linger all day. Average annual rainfall is 32.20 inches (818?mm), falling on 74 days annually. The wettest year was 1983 with 63.07 inches (1,602?mm) and the driest year was 1976 with 11.38 inches (289?mm). The most rainfall in one month was 19.42 inches (493?mm) in February 1998 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was 5.23 inches (133?mm) on December 19, 1981. Measurable snowfall is rare in the lowlands, but light amounts sometimes fall in the nearby mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are an average of 28.9 days with highs of 90?F (32?C) or more and an average of 30.2 days with lows reaching the freezing mark. The record high was 113?F (45?C) on July 11, 1913, and the record low was 9?F (?13?C) on December 25, 1924.[28]\\r\\nSanta Rosa lies atop the Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek segment of the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault System. The Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities estimated a minimum 27 percent chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on this segment by 2037.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 14, 2005, the United States Geological Survey released a map detailing the results of a new tool that measures ground shaking during an earthquake. The map determined that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was most powerful in an area between Santa Rosa and what is now Sebastopol, causing more damage in Santa Rosa (for its size) than any other city affected.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 1, 1969, two earthquakes of magnitudes 5.6 and 5.7 shook Santa Rosa, damaging about 100 structures. They were the strongest quakes to affect the city since 1906. The epicenters were about two miles (3?km) north of Santa Rosa.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to its population, much of Santa Rosa's remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of Santa Rosa Creek and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. Great blue herons, great egrets, snowy egrets and black-crowned herons nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. Deer often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of wild turkeys are relatively common in some areas; and mountain lions are occasionally observed within city limits. Raccoons and opossums are a common sight throughout the city, while foxes, and rabbits may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. Trione Annadel State Park also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. U.S. Route 101 runs roughly northÿsouth through the city, and divides it into east and west sides. State Route 12 runs roughly eastÿwest, and divides the city into north and south sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighborhoods include:\\r\\n\\r\\nA graph of the population growth of Santa Rosa (to 2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2010 United States Census[38] reported that Santa Rosa had a population of 167,815.

Out of the total population, 9.5% of those under the age of 18 and 4.7% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighborhoods such as South Park in south Santa Rosa, and Roseland, West Ninth District, and Apple Valley in west Santa Rosa, are most vulnerable to criminal activity. Acts of crime in these neighborhoods are commonly burglaries, graffiti, and violent gang activity. Mexican American street gangs such as Sure?os and Norte?os have large concentrations throughout Santa Rosa.[42][45][46] In 2011, there were 5 homicides, 58 rapes, 134 robberies, 485 aggravated assaults, and 637 burglaries. The violent crime rate for Santa Rosa (401.7 per 100,000 people) is slightly lower than the rate of California (411.1 per 100,000 people) and higher than that of the entire U.S. (386.3 per 100,000 people).[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa saw the second-highest rate of couples in same-sex marriages among United States cities in 2018, behind only San Francisco.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes Magazine ranked the Santa Rosa metropolitan area 185th out of 200, on its 2007 list of Best Places For Business And Careers.[49] It was second on the list five years before. The area was downgraded because of an increase in the cost of doing business, and reduced job growthboth blamed on increases in the cost of housing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the city's 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[50] the top employers in the city are:\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Rosa is also home to notable smaller businesses such as Moonlight Brewing Company, Russian River Brewing Company and ATIV Software.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2014, Santa Rosa has 12 neighborhood shopping centers and 17 commercial districts,[51] including three sizeable shopping malls: Santa Rosa Plaza, with more than 100 merchants;[52] Coddingtown Mall, with over 40;[53] and Montgomery Village, an open-air mall with more than 70 shops, a supermarket, five banks, and a satellite U.S. Post Office.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sonoma County Library offers a Central Library in downtown Santa Rosa, a Roseland branch on Sebastopol Road, a Northwest branch at Coddingtown Mall, and a Rincon Valley branch in east Santa Rosa.

Three new mixed-use, high-rise buildings, and a new city parking garage, are under development. The Council and downtown business boosters hope condos atop the new buildings will house a population to keep the area active 24 hours a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearby cities and towns of Bodega Bay, Calistoga, Guerneville, Healdsburg, Petaluma, Sebastopol, Sonoma, and Windsor are popular with tourists and readily accessible from Santa Rosa.\\r\\n\\r\\nRailroad Square is the portion of downtown that is on the west side of U.S. Route 101 and has the highest concentration of historic commercial buildings. Of particular note are the four rough-hewn stone buildings at its core, two of which are rare in that they predate the 1906 earthquake. They include the old Northwestern Pacific Railroad depot, prominently seen in the beginning and the end of the Alfred Hitchcock film Shadow of a Doubt, and the still-functioning Hotel La Rose, built in 1907 and registered as one of the National Trust for Historic Preservation Historic Hotels of America. The area contains numerous other historic buildings, such as the former Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad depot, and the Lee Bros. Building, both at the corner of 4th and Wilson Streets. Near it in the West End district are numerous other old buildings, including not only many old houses but the masonry DeTurk Winery complex, dating to the 1880sÿ1890s, and the DeTurk round barn.

The Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints Prime Minister as a Member of Parliament (MP) who, in his opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. The Prime Minister chairs the Cabinet of Malaysia, the de facto executive branch of government.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, became Prime Minister of Malaysia. From independence until the 2018 general election, the Prime Minister had always been from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party of Barisan Nasional (previously Alliance). Following a general election, Mahathir Mohamad took office on 10 May 2018, as the first Prime Minister of the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan (PH). Mahathir is the first Prime Minister not to represent the Alliance/Barisan Nasional coalition. He is also the first Malaysian Prime Minister to serve from two different parties and on non-consecutive terms. \\r\\n\\r\\nMahathir and the PH coalition have confirmed that, after a period of around 2 years, People's Justice Party (PKR) leader Anwar Ibrahim will take over as Prime Minister. On 11 June 2018, Mahathir said he's prepared to stay as Prime Minister for more than two years if that is what members of the public wants.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the federal constitution, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall first appoint as Prime Minister to preside over the Cabinet and requires such Prime Minister to be a member of the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) who in his judgment is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of that House and must not a Malaysian citizen by naturalisation or by registration. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the Prime Minister's advice shall appoint other Ministers from either Dewan Rakyat or Dewan Negara (Senate).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister and his cabinet ministers must take and subscribe in the presence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong the oath of office and allegiance as well as the oath of secrecy before they can exercise the functions of office. The Cabinet shall be collectively responsible to Parliament of Malaysia. The members of the Cabinet shall not hold any office of profit and engage in any trade, business or profession that will cause conflict of interest. The Prime Minister's Department (sometimes referred to as the Prime Minister's Office) is the body and ministry in which the Prime Minister exercises its functions and powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or the house passes a vote of \\"no confidence\\" in the government, the Prime Minister is bound by convention to resign immediately. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong's choice of replacement prime minister will be dictated by the circumstances. Ministers other than the Prime Minister shall hold office during the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, unless the appointment of any Minister shall have been revoked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister but any Minister may resign his office.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a resignation in other circumstances, defeated in an election or the death of a prime minister, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong will generally appoint as Prime Minister the person voted by the governing party as their new leader.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power of the prime minister is subject to a number of limitations. Prime ministers removed as leader of his or her party, or whose government loses a vote of no confidence in the House of Representatives, must advise a new election of the lower house or resign the office. The defeat of a supply bill (one that concerns the spending of money) or unable to pass important policy-related legislation is seen to require the resignation of the government or dissolution of Parliament, much like a non-confidence vote, since a government that cannot spend money is hamstrung, also called loss of supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime minister's party will normally have a majority in the House of Representatives and party discipline is exceptionally strong in Malaysian politics, so passage of the government's legislation through the House of Representatives is mostly a formality.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Constitution, the Prime Ministers role includes advising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on:\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Article 39 of the Constitution, executive authority is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. However, Article 40(1) states that in most cases, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is bound to exercise his powers on the advice of the Cabinet or a minister acting under the Cabinet's general authority. Thus, most of the day-to-day work of governing is actually done by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Article 55(3) of Constitution of Malaysia, the lower house of Parliament unless sooner dissolved by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong with his own discretion on the advice of the prime minister shall continue for five years from the date of its first meeting. Article 55(4) of the Constitution permits a delay of 60 days of general election to be held from the date of dissolution and Parliament shall be summoned to meet on a date not later than 120 days from the date of dissolution.

It was the first international declaration underlining the importance of primary health care. The primary health care approach has since then been accepted by member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) as the key to achieving the goal of \\"Health For All\\" but only in developing countries at first. This applied to all other countries five years later.The Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978 emerged as a major milestone of the twentieth century in the field of public health, and it identified primary health care as the key to the attainment of the goal of \\"Health for All\\" around the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conference called for urgent and effective national and international action to develop and implement primary health care throughout the world and particularly in developing countries in a spirit of technical cooperation and in keeping with a New International Economic Order. It urged governments, the WHO, UNICEF, and other international organizations, as well as multilateral and bilateral agencies, non-governmental organizations, funding agencies, all health workers and the world community to support national and international commitment to primary health care and to channel increased technical and financial support to it, particularly in developing countries. The conference called on the aforementioned to collaborate in introducing, developing and maintaining primary health care in accordance with the spirit and content of the declaration. The declaration has 10 points and is non-binding on member states.\\r\\nThe first section of the declaration reaffirms the WHO definition of health as \\"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\"[2] The definition seeks to include social and economic sectors within the scope of attaining health and reaffirms health as a human right.\\r\\nThe declaration highlighted the inequality of health status between the developed and the developing countries and termed it politically, socially and economically unacceptable.\\r\\nThe third section called for economic and social development as a pre-requisite to the attainment of health for all. It also declared positive effects on economic and social development and on world peace through promotion and protection of the health of the people.\\r\\nParticipation of people as a group or individually in planning and implementing their health care was declared as a human right and duty.\\r\\nThis section emphasized on the role of the state in providing adequate health and social measures. This section enunciated the call for \\"Health For All\\" which became a campaign of the WHO in the coming years. It defined Health for All as the attainment by all peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. The declaration urged governments, international organizations and the whole world community to take this up as a main social target in the spirit of social justice.\\r\\nThis section defined primary health care and urged signatories to incorporate the concept of primary health care in their health systems. Primary health care has since been adopted by many member nations. More recently, Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the WHO has reaffirmed the primary health care approach as the most efficient and cost-effective way to organize a health system. She also pointed out that international evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that health systems oriented toward primary health care produce better outcomes, at lower costs, and with higher user satisfaction.[3]\\r\\nThe seventh section lists the components of primary health care. The next two sections called on all governments to incorporate primary health care approach in their health systems and urged international cooperation in better use of the world's resources.\\r\\nThe Alma-Ata Declaration generated numerous criticisms and reactions worldwide. Many argued that the slogan Health for All by 2000 was not possible and that the declaration did not have clear targets. In his article The Origins of Primary Health Care and Selective Primary Health Care, Marcos Cueto claims that the declaration was condemned as being unrealistic, idealistic, and too broad. As a result of these criticisms, the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored the Health and Population Development Conference held in Italy at the Bellagio Conference Center in 1979 (a year after Alma-Ata). The purpose of this conference was to specify the goals of PHC and to achieve more effective strategies.\\r\\nAs a result, Selective Primary Health Care (PHC) was introduced. As opposed to PHC of the Alma-Ata Declaration, Selective PHC presented the idea of obtaining low-cost solutions to very specific and common causes of death. The targets and effects of Selective PHC were clear, concise, measurable, and easy to observe. This is because Selective PHC had explicit areas of focus that were believed to be the most important. They were known as GOBI (growth monitoring, oral rehydration treatment, breastfeeding, and immunization), and later GOBI-FFF (adding food supplementation, female literacy, and family planning). Unlike the Alma-Ata Declaration, these aspects were very specific and concise, making global health as successful and attainable as possible. Nonetheless, there were still many supporters who preferred the comprehensive PHC introduced at Alma-Ata over Selective PHC, criticizing the latter as a misrepresentation of some core principles of the original declaration. The main critics are toward selective care as a restrictive approach to health. Therefore, such approach to primary care does not contribute toward integral care (globality) and does not address social determinants as a fundamental aspect of illness and thus essential to health care planning.[4]","input":"What was the focus of the 1978 alma ata declaration?"},{"output":"George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil","context":"Biltmore Estate is a large (6950.4 acre or 10.86 square miles) private estate and tourist attraction in Asheville, North Carolina. Biltmore House, the main residence, is a Chateauesque-style mansion built by George Washington Vanderbilt II between 1889 and 1895 and is the largest privately owned house in the United States, at 178,926 square feet (16,622.8?m2)[2] of floor space (135,280 square feet (12,568?m2) of living area).  Still owned by George Vanderbilt's descendants, it remains one of the most prominent examples of the Gilded Age.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1880s, at the height of the Gilded Age, George Washington Vanderbilt II, youngest son of William Henry Vanderbilt, began to make regular visits with his mother, Maria Louisa Kissam Vanderbilt (1821ÿ1896),  to the Asheville, North Carolina, area. He loved the scenery and climate so much that he decided to create his own summer estate in the area, which he called his \\"little mountain escape\\", just as his older brothers and sisters had built opulent summer houses in places such as Newport, Rhode Island, and Hyde Park, New York. Vanderbilt named his estate Biltmore derived from \\"Bildt,\\" Vanderbilt's ancestors' place of origin in Holland, and \\"More\\", Anglo-Saxon for open, rolling land.[3] A portion of the estate was once the community of Shiloh.[4] Vanderbilt bought almost 700 parcels of land, including over 50 farms and at least five cemeteries. A spokesperson for the estate said in 2017 that archives show much of the land \\"was in very poor condition, and many of the farmers and other landowners were glad to sell.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the house began in 1889 and continued well into 1896. In order to facilitate such a large project, a woodworking factory and brick kiln, which produced 32,000 bricks a day, were built onsite, and a three-mile railroad spur was constructed to bring materials to the building site. Construction on the main house required the labor of well over 1,000 workers and 60 stonemasons.[6] Vanderbilt went on extensive buying trips overseas as construction on the house was in progress. He returned to North Carolina with thousands of furnishings for his newly built home including tapestries, hundreds of carpets, prints, linens, and decorative objects, all dating between the 15th century and the late 19th century. Among the few American-made items were the more practical oak drop-front desk, rocking chairs, a walnut grand piano, bronze candlesticks and a wicker wastebasket.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Vanderbilt opened his opulent estate on Christmas Eve 1895 to invited family and friends from across the country, who were encouraged to enjoy leisure and country pursuits. Notable guests to the estate over the years included author Edith Wharton, novelist Henry James, ambassadors Joseph Hodges Choate and Larz Anderson, and Presidents William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. George married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser in 1898 in Paris, France; their only child, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt, was born at Biltmore in the Louis XV room in 1900, and grew up at the estate.\\r\\n\\r\\nDriven by the impact of the newly imposed income taxes, and the fact that the estate was getting harder to manage economically, Vanderbilt initiated the sale of 87,000 acres (352?km2) to the federal government. After Vanderbilt's unexpected death in 1914 of complications from an emergency appendectomy, his widow completed the sale to carry out her husband's wish that the land remain unaltered, and that property became the nucleus of the Pisgah National Forest.[6] Overwhelmed with running such a large estate, Edith began consolidating her interests and sold Biltmore Estate Industries in 1917 and Biltmore Village in 1921. Edith intermittently occupied the house, living in an apartment carved out of the former Bachelors' Wing, until the marriage of her daughter to John Francis Amherst Cecil in April 1924. The Cecils went on to have two sons who were born in the same room as their mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism.[8]  Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck.  David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the divorce of the Cecils in 1934, Cornelia left the estate never to return; however, John Cecil maintained his residence in the Bachelors' Wing until his death in 1954. Their eldest son George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil, occupied rooms in the wing until 1956. At this point Biltmore House ceased to be a family residence and has continued to be operated as a historic house museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nYounger son William A. V. Cecil, Sr. returned to the estate in the late 1950s and joined his brother to manage the estate when it was in financial trouble and make it a profitable and self-sustaining enterprise like his grandfather envisioned. He eventually inherited the estate upon the death of his mother, Cornelia, in 1976, while his brother, George, inherited the then more profitable dairy farm which was split off into Biltmore Farms. In 1995, while celebrating the 100th anniversary of the estate, Cecil turned over control of the company to his son, William A.V. Cecil, Jr.\\r\\n[10] The Biltmore Company is privately held and of the 4,306.86 acres that make up Biltmore Estate, only 1.36 acres are in the city limits of Asheville, and the Biltmore House is not part of any municipality.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963,[12] and remains a major tourist attraction in Western North Carolina with 1.4 million visitors each year.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the death of William A. V. Cecil in October 2017 and his wife Mimi Cecil in November, their daughter Dini Pickering as board chair and their son Bill Cecil as CEO announced that the estate would continue to be run the same way. The house is assessed at $157.2 million but due to an agricultural deferment, county property taxes are paid on only $79.1 million of that.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nVanderbilt commissioned prominent New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had previously designed houses for various Vanderbilt family members, to design the house in the Chateauesque style, using French Renaissance chateaus that Vanderbilt and Hunt had visited in early 1889, including Chateau de Blois, Chenonceau and Chambord in France and Waddesdon Manor in England, as inspiration with their steeply pitched roofs, turrets and sculptural ornamentation.[13] Hunt sited the four-story Indiana limestone-built home to face east with a 375-foot facade to fit into the mountainous topography behind. The facade is asymmetrically balanced with two projecting wings connecting to the entrance tower with an open loggia to the left side and a windowed arcade to the right which held the Winter Garden that was fashionable during the Victorian era. The entrance tower contains a series of windows with decorated jambs that extend from the front door to the most decorated dormer at Biltmore on the fourth floor. The carved decorations include trefoils, flowing tracery, rosettes, gargoyles, and at prominent lookouts, grotesques. The staircase is one of the more prominent features of the east facade, with its three-story, highly decorated winding balustrade with carved statues of St. Louis and Joan of Arc by the Austrian-born architectural sculptor Karl Bitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe south facade has the smallest dimensions for the house and is dominated by three large dormers on the east side and a polygonal turret on the west side. An arbor is attached to the house and is accessed from the library which is located on the ground floor. On the north end of the house, Hunt placed the attached stables, carriage house and its courtyard to protect the house and gardens from the wind. The 12,000-square-foot complex housed Vanderbilt's prized driving horses and the carriage house opposite the stables stored his 20 carriages in addition to any of his guest's carriages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rear western elevation is less elaborate than the front facade, with some windows not having any decoration at all. Two matching polygonal towers in the center are connected to the polygonal south turret by an open loggia that opens the main rooms of the house to the views of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. The loggia is decorated overhead with terracotta tiles set in a herringbone pattern. The self-supporting ceramic tile vault and arch system was used extensively inside and outside of Biltmore, and was patented by Rafael Guastavino, a Spanish architect and engineer, who personally supervised the installation. The limestone columns were carved to reflect the sunlight in aesthetically pleasing and varied ways per Vanderbilt's wish. The rusticated base is a contrast to the smooth limestone used on the remainder of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steeply pitched roof is punctuated by 16 chimneys and covered with slate tiles that were affixed one by one. Each tile was drilled at the corners and wired onto the attics steel infrastructure. Copper flashing was then installed at the junctions to prevent water from penetrating. The fanciful flashing on the ridge of the roof was embossed with George Vanderbilts initials and motifs from his family crest, though the original gold leaf no longer survives.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiltmore House had electricity from the time it was built. With electricity less safe and fire more of a danger at the time, the house had six separate sections divided by brick fire walls.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nVanderbilt paid little attention to the family business or his own investments and it is believed that the construction and upkeep of Biltmore depleted much of his inheritance.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiltmore has four acres of floor space and a total of 250 rooms in the house including 35 bedrooms for family and guests, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces, three kitchens and 19th-century novelties such as electric elevators, forced-air heating, centrally controlled clocks, fire alarms, and a call-bell system.[13] The principal rooms of the house are located on the ground floor. To the right of the marbled Entrance Hall, the octagonal, sunken Winter Garden is surrounded by stone archways with a ceiling of architecturally sculptured wood and multifaceted glass. The centerpiece is a marble and bronze fountain sculpture titled Boy Stealing Geese created by Karl Bitter. On the walls just outside the Winter Garden are copies of the Parthenon frieze. The Banquet Hall is the largest room in the house, measuring 42 feet wide and 72 feet long, with a 70-foot-high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The table could seat 64 guests surrounded by rare Flemish tapestries and a triple fireplace that spans one end of the hall. On the opposite end of the hall is an organ gallery that houses a 1916 Skinner pipe organ. Left unfinished with bare brick walls, the Music Room was not completed and opened to the public until 1976. It showcases a mantle designed by Hunt, and a large engraving by Albrecht Drer called the Triumphal Arch commissioned by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. The mantle had been stored in the stable for over 80 years.\\r\\nTo the left of the entrance hall is the 90-foot-long Tapestry Gallery, which leads to the Library, featuring three 16th-century tapestries representing The Triumph of Virtue Over Vice. Elsewhere on the walls are family portraits by John Singer Sargent, Giovanni Boldini and James Whistler. The two-story Library contains over 10,000 volumes in eight languages, reflecting George Vanderbilt's broad interests in classic literature as well as works on art, history, architecture, and gardening. The second-floor balcony is accessed by an ornate walnut spiral staircase. The baroque detailing of the room is enhanced by the rich walnut paneling and the ceiling painting, The Chariot of Aurora, brought to Biltmore by Vanderbilt from the Palazzo Pisani Moretta in Venice, Italy. The painting by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini is the most important work by the artist still in existence.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second floor is accessed by the cantilevered Grand Staircase of 107 steps spiraling around a four-story, wrought-iron chandelier holding 72 light bulbs.[18] The Second Floor Living Hall is an extension of the grand staircase as a formal hall and portrait gallery, and was restored to its original configuration in 2013. Several large-scale masterpieces are displayed in the hall, including two John Singer Sargent portraits of Biltmore's architect, Richard Morris Hunt, and landscaper, Frederick Law Olmsted, both commissioned for the home by Vanderbilt.[19] Located nearby in the south tower is George Vanderbilt's gilded bedroom with furniture designed by Hunt. His bedroom connects to his wife's Louis XV-style, oval-shaped bedroom in the north tower through a Jacobean carved oak paneled sitting room with an intricate ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suite of rooms includes the Damask Room; the Claude Room, named after one of Vanderbilt's favorite artists, Claude Lorrain; the Tyrolean Chimney Room; and the most grand, the Louis XV Room, so named due to its architectural scheme and furnishings that were very popular in the late nineteenth century. The suite was restored and opened to the public for the first time in 100 years in 2011.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third floor has a number of guest rooms with names that describe the furnishing or artist that they were decorated with. The fourth floor has 21 bedrooms that were inhabited by housemaids, laundresses, and other female servants. Also included on the fourth floor is an Observatory with a circular staircase that leads to a wrought iron balcony with doorways to the rooftop where Vanderbilt could view his estate. Male servants were not housed here, however, but instead resided in rooms above the stable and complex.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Billiard Room is decorated with an ornamental plaster ceiling and rich oak paneling and was equipped with both a custom-made pool table and a carom table (table without pockets). The room was mainly frequented by men, but ladies were welcome to enter as well. Secret door panels on either side of the fireplace led to the private quarters of the Bachelors Wing where female guests and staff members were not allowed. The wing includes the Smoking Room, which was fashionable for country houses, and the Gun Room, which held mounted trophies and displayed George Vanderbilts gun collection.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests of the estate could enjoy other activities that were found on the basement level, including an indoor 70,000-gallon (265,000-litre and 265-cubic meter) heated swimming pool with underwater lighting, one of the nation's first bowling alleys installed in a private residence, and a gymnasium with once state-of-the-art fitness equipment. The service hub of the house is also found in the largest basement in the US, as the location for the main kitchen, pastry kitchen, rotisserie kitchen, walk-in refrigerators that provided an early form of mechanical refrigeration, the servants' dining hall, laundry rooms and additional bedrooms for staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nWanting the best, Vanderbilt envisioned a park-like setting for his home and employed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to design the grounds. However, Olmsted was not impressed with the condition of the 125,000 acres (195?sq?mi; 510?km2) and advised for a park surrounding the house, establishing farms along the river and replanting the rest as a commercial timber forest, a plan to which Vanderbilt agreed. Gifford Pinchot and later Carl A. Schenck were hired to manage the forests, with Schenck establishing the first forestry education program in the U.S., the Biltmore Forest School, on the estate grounds in 1898.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important aspect of the landscaping was the intentionally rustic three-mile (5?km) Approach Road that began at the brick quoined and pebbledash stucco Lodge Gate at the edge of Biltmore Village, and ended at the sphinx-topped stone pillars at the Esplanade. In between, the lane was densely filled with natural and uncultivated looking foliage and shrubbery to provide a relaxing journey for guests.  Olmsted made sure to incorporate 75 acres (30?ha) of formal gardens that had been requested by Vanderbilt for the grounds directly surrounding the house.  He constructed an Italian formal garden, a walled garden, a shrub and rose garden, fountains, and a conservatory with individual rooms for palms and orchids.  There was also a bowling green, an outdoor tea room, and a terrace to incorporate the European statuary that Vanderbilt had brought back from his travels. At the opposite end of the Esplanade is the Rampe Douce, a graduated stairway zigzagging along a rough-cut limestone wall that leads to the grassy slope known as the Vista, topped with a statue of Diana, the goddess of the hunt.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater features were an important aspect of Victorian landscaping and Olmsted incorporated two for the estate: the Bass Pond created from an old creek-fed millpond and the Lagoon. Each was used for guest recreation like fishing and rowing. To supply water for the estate, Olmsted engineered two reservoirs. One was a spring-fed man-made lake on nearby Busbee Mountain. The other was a man-made, brick-lined reservoir, located behind the statue of Diana in the Vista, at an elevation of approximately 266 feet above the Esplanade.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nVanderbilt's idea was to replicate the working estates of Europe. He asked Hunt and Olmsted to design a village with architecturally compatible buildings and picturesque landscaping as a source of income through building rental, a place to help carry out philanthropic programs, and an easy point of access between the estate and the train station.[22] The result was Biltmore Village. The village included rental cottages complete with plumbing and central heating, a post office, shops, doctor's office, school, and a church, known today as the Cathedral of All Souls.[23] Intending that the estate could be self-supporting, Vanderbilt set up scientific forestry programs, poultry farms, cattle farms, hog farms, and a dairy.  His wife, Edith, also enthusiastically supported agricultural reform and promoted the establishment of a state agricultural fair.  In 1901, the Vanderbilts provided financial assistance to Biltmore Industries, started by Biltmore Village resident Eleanor Vance, which taught young people how to make hand-carved furniture, woven baskets, homespun wool fabric, and more.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estate today covers approximately 8,000 acres (13?sq?mi; 32?km2) and is split in half by the French Broad River, overseen by The Biltmore Company, a trust set up by the family. The company is a large enterprise that is one of the largest employers in the Asheville area. Restaurants were opened in 1979 and 1987 as well as four gifts shops in 1993. The former dairy barn was converted into the popular Biltmore Winery in 1985. The AAA four-diamond 210-room Inn on Biltmore Estate opened in 2001, and in 2010, the estate debuted Antler Hill Village, as well as a remodeled winery, and connected farmyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Biltmore Estate licenses its name and design elements to a line of housewares, linens, and luggage called \\"Biltmore For Your Home\\", marketed exclusively by Belk stores.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house has been featured in \\"Empires of the Smoky Skies\\", a scenario in Sid Meier's Civilization V.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estate and its surrounding forest make up the setting of Robert Beatty's 2015 middle-grade novel Serafina and The Black Cloak and its sequels.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grounds and buildings of Biltmore Estate have appeared in a number of major motion pictures and TV series:","input":"Who was the last person to live in biltmore house?"},{"output":"July 28, 2016","context":"Sports Authority, Inc.

The 1980s marked a period of substantial growth for the company through a series of acquisitions.  These mergers included Hagan's Sports Ltd. (1987) and Stevens Brown of Salt Lake City (1987).  In the fall of 1992, Leonard Green & Partners acquired Thrifty and became the company's largest shareholder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time that Gart Sports Company opened the Sportscastle, the Hochberg family and the Cantor family opened their first Sportmart in Niles, Illinois. The company grew to 60 stores in nine states. Gart Sports and Sportmart merged in 1998. Sportmart briefly operated in Canada in the 1990s before closing down their operations after two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nOshman's Sporting Goods was founded in Houston, Texas in 1919 by Jake Oshman. By 1965, Oshman's had become the largest sporting goods chain in Texas, operating 43 Oshman's SuperSports USA stores and 15 traditional stores; the company merged with Gart Sports in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sports Authority, Inc. was founded in Lakes Mall in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida by a syndicate of venture capital groups and several key founding executives.

In 1990, Kmart acquired the company.[8] Five years later, The Sports Authority had expanded to 136 stores in 26 states, and was spun off from parent Kmart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts headquarters were in Lauderdale Lakes,[9][10] near Fort Lauderdale.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGart Sports, which also operated Oshman's and Sportmart, completed a \\"merger of equals\\" with Sports Authority on August 4, 2003. At the time of its merger with Gart Sports Company, The Sports Authority was the largest full-line sporting goods retailer in the United States, and had 205 stores in 33 states. The combined company took the Sports Authority name. With the merger, each share of Sports Authority was exchanged with 0.37 shares of Gart Sports which gave investors in each about 50% of the new merchant. The new company was based in Englewood, Colorado, which was the home of Gart Sports.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of May 2006, the remaining stores that were not operating under the Sports Authority name were re-branded to the Sports Authority name.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2006, Sports Authority agreed to be purchased in a leveraged buyout by affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity investment firm, in a transaction valued at $1.4 billion.[12] Shareholders approved the deal in May 2006.

The report did not specify a date for the closures.[16] On March 2, 2016, Sports Authority filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[17] After considering restructuring, Sports Authority announced that on April 26, they would sell all of their assets, including all of the remaining store locations.[18] Earlier in April, Reuters reported that Academy Sports + Outdoors and Dick's Sporting Goods had expressed interest in purchasing Sports Authority's assets. On May 3, 2016, the company notified the US Bankruptcy Court that it would not reorganize its debt but would auction its assets. Contrary to media reports, the company announced it would not be liquidating its assets, but would be auctioning off its stores and operations, with the intended goal of keeping all of its stores open.[19] On May 18, however, it was announced that the effort to avoid liquidation was unsuccessful, causing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to be converted to Chapter 7.

The thirteenth named storm, fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Matthew brought widespread destruction and catastrophic loss of life during its journey across the Western Atlantic, including parts of Haiti, Cuba, Dominican Republic, the Lucayan Archipelago, the southeastern United States, and the Canadian Maritimes. A total of 603?deaths have been attributed to the storm, including 546?in Haiti, 47?in the United States, 4 in Cuba, 4 in the Dominican Republic, 1 in Colombia, and 1 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, making it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Stan in 2005, which killed 1,668 in Central America. With the storm causing damages estimated in excess of US $15?billion, it was also the most destructive Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, as well as the ninth-costliest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history.\\r\\nOriginating from a tropical wave that emerged off Africa on September?22, Matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the Lesser Antilles on September?28. It became a hurricane north of Venezuela and Colombia on September?29, before undergoing explosive intensification, ultimately reaching Category?5 intensity on October?1 at just 13.4N latitude ÿ the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the Atlantic basin, breaking the record set by Hurricane Ivan in 2004.[1] Matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a strong Category?4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula early on October?4, and then a second one in Cuba later that day. Matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest, making landfall in the northern Bahamas. The storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern United States over the next 36 hours, gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane on the morning of October 8. Matthew re-emerged into the Atlantic shortly afterward, eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on October?9.[2]\\r\\nWidespread effects were felt from Matthew across its destructive path, however, the most significant impacts were felt in Haiti, with US$1.9?billion in damage and 546?deaths. The combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land; around 80% of Jrmie sustained significant damage. Four people were killed in Cuba due to a bridge collapse, and total losses in the country amounted to US$2.58?billion, most of which occurred in the Guantnamo Province. Passing through the Bahamas as a major hurricane, Matthew spread damage across several islands, compounding relief efforts from Hurricane Joaquin which had pounded similar areas just the previous year. Grand Bahama was hit directly, where most homes sustained damage in the townships of Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock. Preparations began in earnest across the southeastern United States as Matthew approached, with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding, especially in the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area. In Florida, over 1?million lost power as the storm passed to the east, with 478,000?losing power in Georgia and South Carolina. While damage was primarily confined to the coast in Florida and Georgia, torrential rains spread inland in the Carolinas and Virginia, causing widespread flooding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 22 and moved rapidly across the Atlantic, being monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for possible tropical cyclogenesis. Despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the Lesser Antilles on September 27, the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone, as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center. However, by 12:00?UTC on September 28, the wave developed a closed circulation while located near Barbados, hence becoming a tropical storm, and was assigned the name Matthew. Continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge, the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00?UTC on September?29. The effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day, and Matthew began a period of explosive intensification; during a 24-hour period beginning at 00:00?UTC on September?30, the cyclone's maximum winds more than doubled, from 80?mph (130?km/h) to 165?mph (270?km/h), making Matthew a Category 5 hurricane,[1] the first since Hurricane Felix in 2007;[3] the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the Atlantic since records began. Due to upwelling of cooler waters, Matthew weakened to a Category?4 hurricane later on October?1, before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155?mph (250?km/h) late on October 2.[1]\\r\\nSlowly rounding the ridge, Matthew fluctuated in intensity within the Category 4 range from October?1ÿ5. Intensification resumed again late on October 3 and culminated when Matthew made landfall near Les Anglais, Haiti, around 11:00 UTC on October 4 with winds of 150?mph (240?km/h) and a pressure of 934 millibars (27.6?inHg), making it the strongest to hit Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964. Continuing northward, the hurricane struck Mais in Cuba early on October?5 as a slightly weaker storm. Cuba's and Haiti's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category 3 status, as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the Bahamas. Restrengthening occurred as Matthew's circulation became better organized, with the storm becoming a Category?4 hurricane again while passing Freeport. However, Matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place. The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia, with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in Florida while the system was a Category?3 hurricane (with the strongest winds remaining just offshore). Matthew weakened to a Category?2 hurricane late on October?7 and then to a Category?1 hurricane by 12:00?UTC on October?8.[1]\\r\\nAround 15:00?UTC on October?8, the hurricane made landfall at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, near McClellanville, South Carolina, with winds of 85?mph (140?km/h) and a central pressure of 963?mbar (28.4?inHg), which made it the strongest to strike the United States in terms of pressure since Hurricane Isaac in 2012, and the first hurricane to make landfall north of Florida in October since Hurricane Hazel in 1954.[nb 1][4][1] Convection became displaced from the center as Matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear, with the NHC declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200?mi (320?km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on October?9. The remnants persisted for another day before they were absorbed by a cold front.[1]\\r\\nMatthew set several records during its long and destructive journey. Matthew intensified into a Category?5 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4?degrees north, breaking the record set by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7?degrees north.[1] Matthew also maintained at least Category?4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of October, according to Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University, doing so for roughly 5 days.[5]\\r\\nOn September?27, prior to Matthew becoming a tropical cyclone, LIAT began cancelling flights across the Windward Islands in anticipation of squally weather.[6] Schools and businesses were closed for the duration of Matthew's passage on September?27 and 28 on Grenada,[7] St. Vincent and St. Lucia; schools in Dominica suspended classes until October?3.[8][9] Hewanorra International Airport and George F. L. Charles Airport on St. Lucia were closed on September?28.[9] Six shelters were opened across the island; 133?sought refuge in them.[10] Upon the formation of Matthew as a tropical cyclone on September?28, governments across the Windward Islands issued tropical storm warnings in anticipation of gale-force winds.[11]\\r\\nThe storm's unusual south track prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches on September?28 for Aruba, Bonaire, Cura?ao, and the northern coast of Colombia from the ColombiaÿVenezuela border to Riohacha.[12][13] North Atlantic hurricanes affecting South America are uncommon. The watch in Colombia was later upgraded to a warning on September?30 as Matthew continued on a west-southwest track near the country.[14] Residents across the ABC Islands were advised to board their homes and stock up on supplies, leading to long lines at supermarkets and gas stations.[15] Cura?ao's government postponed the 2016 general election until October?5.[16] Government offices in Aruba closed for September?30.[15] A local sporting event, the Kingdom Tournament, was canceled in Aruba.[16] Schools across the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia suspended activities for September?30.[17] Officials opened shelters and closed beaches across the peninsula.[18]\\r\\nWith Matthew posing a significant threat to Jamaica, emergency officials ordered all fishermen on the nation's cays and banks to evacuate to the mainland on September?29. The following day, Prime Minister Andrew Holness held an emergency meeting regarding the hurricane and placed the government on high alert.[19] A hurricane watch was issued for the country on September?30,[20] and later upgraded to a warning on October?1.[21] Officials in Trelawny Parish placed 60?shelters on stand-by on October?2.[22] Supermarkets were overwhelmed with residents stocking up on supplies, and many reported empty shelves and low supplies of bread, kerosene, and candles. Many people boarded up their homes and protected their property with sand bags. One hundred female prisoners were relocated from a facility in St. Catherine Parish to another in Kingston. Toll fees along Highway 2000 were to be waived during the hours before Matthew's arrival. Service at both Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport was scheduled to be suspended during the evening of October?2 or by the morning of October?3.[23] The Jamaica Urban Transit Company scheduled to suspend services beginning at 6:00?p.m. local time.[24] The Jamaica Public Service informed residents that the power grid may be shut off during the storm if conditions become too severe.[25] Members of the Jamaica Defence Force were deployed nationwide in advance of the hurricane in order to more swiftly deal with its aftermath.[26]\\r\\nSchools and government offices suspended operations starting on October?3.[27][28] A total of 900?shelters opened across Jamaica and the Urban Transit Company provided buses to evacuate people from Kingston to the National Arena. Local Minister Desmond McKenzie warned that the infrastructure of Kingston would be unable to handle the magnitude of rainfall expected.[27] Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned residents that Matthew could be more severe than Hurricane Gilbert which devastated the nation in 1988.[29]\\r\\nThough forecast to pass over Jamaica at the time, the large extent of tropical storm-force winds prompted the issuance of a tropical storm watch for Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula toward the border with the Dominican Republic.[20] Following an eastward shift in Matthew's predicted track, a hurricane watch was issued for much of Haiti on October?1, encompassing areas from M?le-Saint-Nicolas south to the Dominican Republic border;[30] this was upgraded to a warning just hours later.[21] The warning eventually encompassed the entire country by the afternoon of October?2.[31] Residents on outlying islands of Haiti were evacuated to the mainland.[32] Life-threatening rainfall was forecast to affect much of the nation,[33] with accumulations averaging 15 to 25?in (38 to 64?cm) along the southern coast with isolated peaks up to 40?in (100?cm).[34] Although government officials held meetings on storm preparation, Radio France Internationale reported that Haiti does not have the logistical capability to handle a large-scale disaster. Only 576 shelters, with a collective capacity of 90,000?people, were listed for all of southern Haiti.[35] According to the International Organization for Migration, 55,107?internally displaced persons remained in camps or hosting sites without adequate protection from the hurricane.[36]\\r\\nProvisional President of Haiti Jocelerme Privert addressed the nation on October?2, urging those living along the coast and in poorly constructed homes to evacuate and comply with authorities.[37] Despite pleas from officials, many residents refused to leave their homes.[38] Schools were closed for October?3ÿ4, though government offices remained open.[37] Nationwide, a total of 1,300?shelters were readied with a total capacity of 390,000?people. More than 18,000?volunteers and members of the Red Cross, community intervention teams, municipal committees, and local emergency services were readied to assist residents.[39] At least 500?people were evacuated from Jrmie.[40] Although civil protection officials took to the streets to warn people, many residents were unaware that Matthew was even approaching the country a day before its expected landfall.[41] Evacuations continued through the hurricane's landfall with the total number of people in shelters reaching 9,280 by 2:00?a.m. local time on October?4.[42]\\r\\nOn October 5, the Electoral Provisional Council postponed the presidential election, the second round of the legislative elections and the first round of the Senate elections until November 20.[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of October?2, a tropical storm warning was raised for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic from Barahona west to the Haitian border, and a tropical storm watch was issued for the northern coast from Puerto Plata west to the Haitian border.[44] At least 8,500?people were evacuated in southwestern areas of the country by the morning of October?3.[40]\\r\\nThe Meteorological Service of Cuba raised hurricane watches for all of southeastern Cuba on October?1, encompassing the provinces of Camagey, Las Tunas, Granma, Holgun, Santiago de Cuba, and Guantnamo.[21] This was subsequently upgraded to a warning on October?2 for all provinces except Camagey.[31] Non-essential personnel in the United States' Guantanamo Bay Naval Base began evacuations that day.[32] Evacuations of more than 1?million people across Cuba started that morning, including 252,000 in Santiago de Cuba, and 230,000 from Las Tunas with priority placed on those along the coast.[45][46] Across Santiago de Cuba, which suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, 218?shelters were opened and officials placed extra attention on Socapa, Caracoles, and Cayo Granma.[45] Emergency personnel, primarily doctors, were dispatched to high-risk areas and supplies were stockpiled.[46]\\r\\nThe Government of the Bahamas began issuing hurricane watches on October?2 for southeastern islands as well as the Turks and Caicos.[31] Flights across southern islands were cancelled and schools suspended operations beginning the following day.[47]\\r\\nOn October?3, the governors of Florida and North Carolina declared a state of emergency.[48][49] The next day, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley ordered an evacuation for those residents living within one hundred miles (160?km) of the coast.[50] Interstate 26 in South Carolina eastbound between the coast and Columbia was reversed on Wednesday to facilitate movement away from the Lowcountry and Charleston areas.[51] Evacuations of Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina began this day as well.[52] By October?4, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory had ordered that evacuation be mandatory. A state of emergency was also declared for 13?counties in eastern Georgia.[53]\\r\\nOn October?5, Port Canaveral was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard, the first closure since 2004. Eight cruise ships and four cargo ships were scheduled to visit the port between October?5ÿ9.[54] On Cape Canaveral, home to both civilian and military spaceflight facilities, no rockets or spacecraft were in vulnerable positions; at the time of Matthew's approach, the next launch was scheduled for November?4.[55] The Kennedy Space Center began preparations of the facilities on October?5. Older buildings at the KSC were designed to withstand winds of 105ÿ125?mph (170ÿ200?km/h); buildings constructed after 1992, when Category?5 Hurricane Andrew struck the Miami area, are built to withstand 130?mph (210?km/h) winds.[56] At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the U.S. Air Force's 45th Space Wing began disconnecting electric power to non-essential facilities on October?4.[55]\\r\\nFor the fourth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort closes its theme parks are Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney's Animal Kingdom water parks are Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon, and Disney Springs were closed at 5:00?p.m. Eastern Time on October 6 and did not open on October?7.[57] This was the first time since 2004 that the parks have closed, all instances due to hurricanes. Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando resort and SeaWorld Orlando, also closed.[58]\\r\\nThe Southeastern Conference football matchup between LSU and Florida, scheduled for October 8 in Gainesville, was cancelled. The hurricane washed out NASCAR racing at Charlotte Motor Speedway on October 7 and 8, with the Drive for the Cure 300 race in the Xfinity Series originally scheduled for October 7 and the Bank of America 500 race in the Sprint Cup Series originally scheduled for October 8 both postponed until October 9.[59][60]\\r\\nOn October?6, U.S. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency for Florida,[61] later extending to include Georgia and South Carolina.[62] Florida's governor Rick Scott urged over 1.5 million people to evacuate,[63] with Hurricane Matthew expected to make landfall by the evening of that day.[64] Several news anchors also issued dire warnings urging Floridians to evacuate.[65][66]\\r\\nThat same day, Georgia governor Nathan Deal ordered a mandatory evacuation for all areas of the state east of Interstate 95, and the Georgia Department of Public Safety reversed the eastbound lanes on a portion of Interstate 16 effective until the following day.[67][68]\\r\\nOn October?6, the conservative news aggregator Drudge Reportrun by Matt Drudgeheadlined a five-word comment on Matthew: \\"Storm Fizzle? Matthew Looks Ragged!\\" which linked to a Miami Herald article.[69][70] Drudge later used Twitter to claim that the National Hurricane Center was lying to the public about the intensity of the storm, stating that measurements from Nassau, Bahamas, did not match the 165?mph (270?km/h) gusts listed in public advisories. The tweets implied that the hurricane was not as dangerous as it seemed and that politicians were trying to \\"blame mankind,\\"[71] referring to a blog posting about Hillary Clinton.[71][72] This came on the heels of radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh's claims of the conspiracy to \\"sell\\" climate change.[73] The claims of conspiracy were posted as Matthew posed a dire threat to Florida's east coast and when residents across the state were being urged to evacuate immediately.[74] Drudge's commentary was quickly met with sharp condemnation and criticism from meteorologists and public officials. Democratic Representative Keith Ellison called the comments \\"irresponsible\\" and urged people to \\"not listen to this man.\\"[71] Jason Samenow of The Washington Post described it as an \\"incredible and offensive accusation\\", and stated that it \\"may have introduced enough doubt to lead [residents] into a decision they will regret.\\"[69]\\r\\nOn St. Vincent heavy rains caused landslides and flooding across the island. One person was killed in the town of Layou when a boulder broke loose and crushed him.[8] In nearby Buccament Bay, a river overtopped its banks, prompting at least 25?people to evacuate to emergency shelters. The Hermitage River rose by at least 3.6?ft (1.1?m) in one hour, and as a precautionary measure, the Central Water and Sewage Authority shut off all water service. Flooding also took place in Vermont, South Rivers, sections of Kingstown, Campden Park, Arnos Vale, and Langley Park. Debris deposited by flooded rivers rendered many roads impassable.[9]\\r\\nStrong winds in excess of 60?mph (97?km/h) downed many trees and power lines on St. Lucia, leaving roughly 70?percent of the island without power. Landslides and flooding, the result of more than 10?in (250?mm) of rain accompanying the storm, damaged many homes and roads.[8] Rainfall at Hewanorra International Airport amounted to 13.19?in (335?mm).[81] The nation's banana crop suffered significant damage; 85?percent of farms reported losses. Two homes were destroyed, one in Bisee, and one in Gros Islet; several others were damaged. Roads in Castries, Gros-Islet, Dennery, and Soufriere became impassible from debris or landslides.[10] Some damage was also reported on Dominica, temporarily leaving many people without water and electricity.[8] Heavy rainfall in Grenada disrupted the water supply in multiple communities.[82]\\r\\nIn Martinique strong winds, which gusted up to 89?mph (143?km/h) in Saint-Pierre,[81] wreaked havoc on the power grid; roughly 55,000?people lost electricity. Numerous trees downed by the winds blocked roadways while heavy rains led to flooding. The main road from Fort-de-France to southern towns was rendered impassable during the storm. Approximately 4,000?people lost their water supply. Three people sustained minor injuries.[83]\\r\\nThe effects of Matthew across the ABC Islands were relatively limited despite its proximity. Some street flooding occurred on Aruba and Cura?ao. Heavy winds were also experienced. There was some damage to cars after street flooding occurred. Outdoor bars and restaurants were damaged. [15] The Guajira Peninsula of Colombia saw its first heavy rain event in three years, leading to widespread flash flooding. One person drowned in a swollen river in Uribia;[18] 1.29?in (32.8?mm) of rain fell in 30?minutes in the town.[84] Rainfall in Cartagena reached 8.7?in (222?mm) during a 24-hour span and Santa Marta saw 5.5?in (140?mm).[85] Along coastal areas of the peninsula, large swells damaged buildings, prompting the evacuation of 380?people in Manaure.[17][18] Roughly 70?percent of Tucurinca flooded when the Magdalena River overtopped its banks; a nearby bridge collapsed, isolating some communities.[86] Approximately 73,000?people were affected by the floods.[85] The dangerous conditions produced by Matthew prevented thousands of people from voting in a peace agreement referendum.[87]\\r\\nJamaica suffered relatively minor effects, characteristic of tropical storm conditions. Along the coast, rip currents and beach erosion was reported, with additional flooding due to rainfall occurring. Strong wind gusts tore at the island's vegetation, causing minor damage.\\r\\nLarge swells reached the outlying Haitian island of ?le--Vache on October?2, prompting the evacuation of 89?people.[88] Despite boating bans, many fishermen continued work in rough conditions. Consequently, two fishermen went missing on the morning of October?3: one near Saint-Jean-du-Sud and the other near Aquin; one was later found dead.[41] Antecedent rainfall associated with the outer bands of Matthew triggered flooding in several towns in southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic.[40] A person was killed when a tree fell on his home in Port Salut, while a 26-year-old man drowned while trying to rescue a child from a rushing river.[89]\\r\\nStriking the Tiburon Peninsula as a Category?4 hurricane on the morning of October?4, Matthew was the strongest storm to directly impact Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964. An anemometer at Antoine-Simon Airport in Les Cayes, east of where Matthew made landfall, measured a gust of 107?mph (172?km/h) before the station went offline. Gusts in the nation's capital city of Port-au-Prince reached 60?mph (97?km/h).[90] Communications with areas in the direct path of Matthew were lost, and tens of thousands of people became isolated as roads and bridges were destroyed. A major bridge connecting parts of Grand'Anse to the rest of the country collapsed during a flash flood. 80% of Jrmie,[91] along the north shore of the Tiburon Peninsula, suffered tremendous damage; homes were flattened and medical facilities suffered major damage. A radio host in Port-au-Prince stated that Jrmie was \\"pretty much wiped out from the seaboard all the way to the cathedral\\".[92]\\r\\nOfficially, 546 deaths were attributed to the storm in Haiti,[1] however local governments believed the death toll to be over 1,000; this value may have been overestimated.[93][94][95][96][97][98] According to the nation's Civil Protection Directorate, the death toll was 546 as of October?14, with 128?people missing and 439?injured.[79][80][99] This figure was later confirmed by the National Hurricane Center.[1] The government also estimates damages at close to $1.9 billion.[1][100] Approximately 2.1?million people were affected by the storm, of whom 1.4?million (12?percent of Haiti's population) were left in need of assistance. Furthermore, roughly 175,000?people were left homeless.[80]\\r\\nThe Dominican Republic reported significant rainfall and coastal flooding due to Matthew, an automated weather station in Cabo Rojo, Dominican Republic, measured 8.43?in (214?mm) of rain by the afternoon of October?3.[101] Four people died in the Dominican Republic after a house collapsed on top of them.[78]\\r\\nCoastal flooding began in Granma Province, Cuba, on October?2, affecting three towns along the Sierra Maestras.[45] Hurricane Matthew struck the easternmost province of Cuba during the evening of October?4 as a Category?4, causing tremendous damage. The coastal city of Baracoa suffered widespread damage from violent winds, and storm surge, the latter of which gutted countless buildings.[109] Despite the severity of damage, no fatalities were reported in the city. A communication tower in Majayara collapsed during the storm and a bridge spanning the Toa river was destroyed; several communities left isolated as a result.[110] Damages in Cuba amounted to $2.58?billion USD; most of which occurred in the Guantnamo Province.[103]\\r\\nNearly two months later, on November 22, a municipal bridge in the city of Moa that was damaged by Hurricane Matthew collapsed, killing four employees of Canadian mining company Sherritt International. The employees were undertaking repairs to restore access between Moa and a mining site.[77]\\r\\nExperiencing a direct hit from the eyewall of Matthew, Grand Bahama suffered extensive damage. An estimated 95?percent of homes in Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock sustained severe damage. Numerous trees and power lines were toppled by the storm's high winds, rendering roads impassable. Flooding-induced by the backside of the storm affected much of the western half of the island.[111] Total losses from Matthew in the Bahamas are estimated to be around $600?million USD.[75][112]\\r\\nIn total, the storm killed 47 people in the US, including 26 in North Carolina, 12 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 4 in South Carolina, and 2 in Virginia.[118][119][120][121] According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, damage from Matthew across the United States reached approximately $10?billion. This ranked it the costliest national disaster in the country for 2016 alongside record floods in Louisiana.[122]\\r\\nAs Hurricane Matthew traveled rapidly towards the southeastern region of the United States, it hit closely to the coasts of Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, and North Carolina. On October 7 in Fernandina Beach, Florida, there was a peak surge of 9.88?ft (3.01?m) above normal. Additionally, in the St. Augustine area, water was reported to be 2.5?ft (0.76?m) above ground.[123]\\r\\nAs Matthew tracked parallel to the Florida coast, it left over one million people without power across the state of Florida.[124] In Jacksonville it caused major sand dune damage and flooding in the St. Johns River. It also destroyed many properties and knocked out power for nearly 250,000 electrical customers.[125] In Indialantic, Florida, firefighters exposed themselves to the storm's winds to put out a fire, which reportedly destroyed a greenhouse.[126] In Florida, one woman died due to a heart attack; she had called for aid, but medical services were not able to arrive due to Matthew's high winds. Another two women were killed by falling trees.[127][128] In the Flagler Beach area, a portion of Florida State Road A1A was washed away.[129] At Kennedy Space Center, winds reached 80?mph (130?km/h) at ground level while a gust of 136?mph (219?km/h) was observed atop a 500?ft (150?m) tower. The facility suffered several million dollars-worth of damage, though overall impacts were less than anticipated. The roof of Operations Support Building II broke, and rainwater damaged the interior. Air conditioning was lost throughout Launch Complex 39 as well.[130] The planned launches of GOES-R, NOAA's next generation weather satellite, and CYGNSS, a cluster of smaller satellites which study hurricanes, were delayed due to the suspension of operations during Matthew.[131][132][133]\\r\\nOver 250,000 customers were left without power in Georgia after Hurricane Matthew affected the area. Roads were also blocked in the Brunswick, Georgia, area, where all access points to St. Simons Island were rendered impassable.[134]\\r\\nAcross South Carolina, at least 600,000 individuals lost power, where significant flooding was reported to have occurred in Charleston after a seawall was breached.[135] Hilton Head Island experienced widespread water, sewer and power outages for several days, and the only road onto the island was not re-opened to residents until October 11. It is estimated that over 120,000 trees were downed on the island, causing extensive tree-strike damage to residences and businesses. Over 2.1 million cubic yards of vegetative debris generated by the storm was collected. The Waccamaw River crested in Conway at 17.9?ft (5.5?m), breaking a record set by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. The Little Pee Dee River reached a record crest of 17.1?ft (5.2?m) at Galivant's Ferry, also breaking a 1928 record.[136]\\r\\nTwenty-six people died in storm-related incidents across North Carolina.[115] 680,000 in North Carolina were without power at one point.[138] Sections of Interstate 95 in South Carolina and in North Carolina had to be shut down as a result of hurricane flooding.[139] The North Carolina section reopened October 17.[140] After 10?in (25?cm) of rain fell in Cumberland, Harnett, Hoke, Moore and Robeson Counties on September 28 causing flooding, Matthew dumped another 10?in (25?cm) to 14?in (36?cm).[141] As a result, the Lumber River reached a record 24?ft (7.3?m) in the south end of Lumberton, breaking the record of 20.5?ft (6.2?m) feet.[142] Robeson County schools did not reopen until October 31.[143] In Smithfield, the Neuse River crested at 29.09?ft (8.87?m), 2?ft (0.61?m) higher than after Hurricane Fran.[144] In Kinston, the Neuse crested at 28.31?ft (8.63?m), a foot (300 mm) higher than the record set by Hurricane Floyd.[145] In Greenville, the Tar River crested at 24.5?ft (7.5?m).[137] Preliminary estimates indicate that roughly 100,000?structures were flooded across the state and damage reached US$1.5?billion.[146]\\r\\nWhen the hurricane hit Virginia, Matthew caused two deaths and street flooding in the eastern part of the state.[147][121] The Northeast received heavy rain and minor flooding throughout the days of October 9 and 10.[148]\\r\\nMatthew's post-tropical remains were absorbed into a frontal zone off the coast of North Carolina. The humidity of the tropical system was drawn into the storm that was formed then. The latter gave heavy rain and strong winds in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland from October 10 to 11.\\r\\nIn Nova Scotia, rain amounts were recorded from east to west as 8.85?in (224.8?mm) in Sydney (Cape Breton Island), 5.09?in (129.2?mm) in Port Hawkesbury, 4.50?in (114.4?mm) in Chticamp, 4.05?in (102.8?mm) in Halifax, 3.263?in (82.88?mm) in Kentville, and 1.94?in (49.2?mm) in Yarmouth.[149] Heavy rains and strong winds caused flooding and dangerous conditions, particularly in the counties of Pictou, Antigonish, Guysborough and Cape Breton. Several roads were closed to heavy trucks, including Halifax Harbour bridges and the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.[149]\\r\\nNewfoundland was even more affected with accumulations generally ranging from 3.9 to 5.9?in (100 to 150?mm) in the central, southern and western areas. Steady rain fell sometimes at a rate of 0.39 to 0.79?in (10 to 20?mm) per hour, and even 1.7?in (42?mm) per hour in Burgeo. A private station in that community recorded a total of 9.23?in (234.4?mm), while the official station of the Gander International Airport signaled 6.45?in (163.8?mm).[150][151]\\r\\nThe rain caused numerous landslides and swollen rivers cut roads. The state of emergency was declared in Lewisporte, St. Alban's and Little Burnt Bay.[152] The town of St. Alban's, a community of about 1,200, was cut off from the surrounding communities when the main bridge in town was carried by the waters and a nearby community (Conne River) provided a boat to transport people to St. Alban's and out of the community.[152] The highway to Burgeo, on the south coast of Newfoundland, was also flooded and had to be closed.[150]\\r\\nThe winds of over 56?mph (90?km/h) also caused many fallen trees and electric power outages. The official maximum winds were recorded in Port aux Basques at 80?mph (128?km/h) and informally in Green Island, Fortune Bay, at 81?mph (130?km/h).[150] Damage to roads across Newfoundland was assessed in excess of CA$10?million (US$7.6?million).[76]\\r\\nIn Martinique, lectricit de France requested additional crews from Guadeloupe and French Guiana to help restore power. Members of the military and Forces fran?aises aux Antilles were deployed to assist in clearing debris from roadways.[83] The St. Lucia Red Cross distributed non-food items to 270?people affected by the storm.[153]\\r\\nOn October?4, the United States prepared the aircraft carrier, the hospital ship USNS?Comfortwhich previously aided thousands in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquakeand the transport dock for relief operations in Haiti. USS?Mesa Verde and USS?George Washington were later relieved by USS?Iwo Jima, along with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. United States Southern Command also deployed 100?troops with 9?helicopters to the Cayman Islands to prepare for relief work.[154] Initial estimates indicated at least 350,000?people were in need of assistance.[92]\\r\\nThe bridge between the south and Port-au-Prince was destroyed. As a result, aid agencies reported they were having difficulty getting around to the most damaged and storm-affected parts of Haiti.[155]\\r\\nThe commander of U.S. forces in the Caribbean reported that troops and 6 helicopters from Joint Task Force-Bravo had been deployed to Haiti for the aftermath, and were expected to arrive on October?6. These are expected to help with search-and-rescue missions as well as providing medical assistance. In addition to his, a one-star navy admiral will also travel to lead the task force involved in the operations. More than 300 military personnel will most likely travel to Haiti, with 300 Marines on board on the ships sent out for aid from the U.S.[156]\\r\\nA number of aid agencies deployed to Haiti to help with the aftermath:[157]\\r\\nThe World Food Programme coordinated with the Government of Cuba to provide food to approximately 180,000?people in need across eastern provinces. The operation would span six months and cost US$4?million.[160]\\r\\nIn Georgia, the Governor retracted previous evacuations later, emphasizing that their lives could not be endangered for those who chose not to leave. 1,000 members of the National Guard were deployed for help later.[161]\\r\\nIn North Carolina, nearly 900 people had been rescued by boat crews by the morning of October?9.[162] In April?2017, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper requested $929?million in federal funds. The following month, the Trump administration denied more than 99?percent of this request and only provided $6.1?million to the state.[163]\\r\\nOn March?26, 2017, it was announced by the World Meteorological Organization that the name Matthew was retired due to the extensive damage and loss of life it caused along its track, particularly in Haiti, Cuba, and the United States, and will never again be used to name an Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with Martin for the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.[164]","input":"What category was hurricane matthew when he hit florida?"},{"output":"was a value placed on every being and piece of property","context":"Weregild (also spelled wergild, wergeld (in archaic/historical usage of English), weregeld, etc.), also known as man price, was a value placed on every being and piece of property, for example in the Frankish Salic Code. If property was stolen, or someone was injured or killed, the guilty person would have to pay weregild as restitution to the victim's family or to the owner of the property.[1][2]\\r\\nWeregild payment was an important legal mechanism in early Germanic society; the other common form of legal reparation at this time was blood revenge. The payment was typically made to the family or to the clan.\\r\\nNo distinction was made between murder and manslaughter until these distinctions were instituted by the re-introduction of Roman law in the 12th century.[3]\\r\\nPayment of the weregild was gradually replaced with capital punishment due to Christianization, starting around the 9th century, and almost entirely by the 12th century when weregild began to cease as a practice throughout the Holy Roman Empire.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word weregild is composed of were, meaning \\"man\\", and geld, meaning \\"payment or fee\\", as in Danegeld. Geld or Jeld was the Old English and Old Frisian word for money, and still is in Dutch, Frisian, German and Afrikaans. The Danish word g?ld and Norwegian gjeld both mean \\"debt\\". \\"-G?ld\\" is also a constituent of some Swedish words, having the same meaning: e.g. ?terg?lda (retribute, return favor), geng?ld (in return/exchange), vederg?lda (revenge), and the formal/legal term g?lden?r (geldeneer, referring to someone who is indebted). The word survives in English in the word \\"yield\\"; an equivalent reconstruction in Modern English of the term would therefore be *manyield or *wereyield.\\r\\nThe same concept outside Germanic culture is known as blood money. Words include ericfine in Ireland, galanas in Wales, veriraha in Finnish, vira (\\"־Ұ\\") in Russia and g?܇wszczyzna in Poland.\\r\\nIn the Arab world, the very similar institution of diyya is maintained into the present day.\\r\\nThe size of the weregild was largely conditional upon the social rank of the victim. There used to be something of a \\"basis\\" fee for a standard \\"free man\\" that could then be multiplied according to the social rank of the victim and the circumstances of the crime. The weregild for women relative to that of men of equal rank varied: among the Alamanni it was double the weregild of men, among the Saxons half that of men.\\r\\nIn the Migration period the standard weregeld for a freeman appears to have been 200 solidi (shillings), an amount reflected as the basic fee due for the death of a churl (or ceorl) both in later Anglo-Saxon and continental law codes.\\r\\nIn the 8th century the Lex Alamannorum sets the weregeld for a duke or archbishop at three times the basic value (600 shillings), while the killing of a low ranking cleric was fined with 300, raised to 400 if the cleric was attacked while he was reading mass.\\r\\nDuring the reign of Charlemagne his missi dominici required three times the regular weregild should they be killed whilst on a mission from the king.\\r\\nIn 9th century Mercian law a regular freeman (churl) was worth 200 shillings[5] (twyhyndeman), and a nobleman was worth 1,200 (twelfhyndeman), a division established enough that two centuries later a charter of King Cnut's would simply refer to \\"all his people - the twelve-hundreders and the two-hundreders\\". The law code even mentions the weregeld for a king, at 30,000 thrymsas, composed of 15,000 for the man, paid to the royal family, and 15,000 for the kingship, paid to the people. An archbishop or nobleman is likewise valued at 15,000 thrymsas. The weregild for a Welshman was 220 shillings if he owned at least one hide of land and was able to pay the king's tribute. If he has only 1 hide and cannot pay the tribute, his wergild was 80 shillings and then 70 if he was landless yet free.\\r\\nThralls and slaves legally commanded no weregild, but it was commonplace to make a nominal payment in the case of a thrall and the value of the slave in such a case. Technically this amount cannot be called a weregild, because it was more akin to a reimbursement to the owner for lost or damaged property.\\r\\nA classic example of a dispute over the weregild of a slave is contained in Iceland's Egil's Saga.\\r\\nIn the V?lsungasaga or Saga of the Volsungs, the ?sir (Odin, Loki and H?nir) are asked to pay weregild for killing Otr, son of Hreidmar. Otr is a \\"great fisherman\\" and resembles an otter. He is 'eating a salmon and half dozing' on the river banks of Andvari's Falls when Loki kills him by throwing a stone at him. Later that evening, the ?sir visit Hreidmar's house where they are seized and imposed with a fine. Their fine consists of \\"filling the [Otr] skin with gold and covering the outside with red gold.\\" Loki is sent to get the gold and he manages to trick the dwarf Andvari into giving him the gold as well as a curse ring: \\"The dwarf went into the rock and said that the gold ring would be the death of whoever owned it, and the same applied to all the gold.\\"[6]\\r\\nIn the Story of Grettir the Strong, chapter 27, \\"The Suit for the Slaying of Thorgils Makson\\", Thorgeir conveys to court Thorgils Arison's offer of weregild as atonement for killing Thorgils Makson.[7]\\r\\nIn the epic poem Beowulf, lines 156-158 Grendel refuses to settle his killings with payment or recompense, and at lines 456-472, Hroegar recalls the story of how Ecgteow (Beowulf's father) once came to him for help, for he had slain Heaeolaf, a man from another tribe called the Wulfings, and either could not pay the wergild or they refused to accept it. Hroegar had married Wealhteow, who probably belonged to the Wulfing tribe, and was able to use his kinship ties to persuade the Wulfings to accept the wergild and end the feud. Hroegar sees Beowulf's offer as a son's gratitude for what Hroegar had done for Beowulf's father.\\r\\nIn the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, the journal of Isildur reveals that he justified taking the One Ring as a weregild for the deaths of his father (Elendil) and brother (Anrion) in battle. Appendix A of The Return of the King also mentions a rich weregild of gold sent by T~rin II, Steward of Gondor, to King Folcwine of Rohan, after the death of his twin sons, Folcred and Fastred, in battle in Ithilien.\\r\\nIn Jim Butcher's Dresden Files novel Skin Game, Dresden offers John Marcone a cashbox of diamonds as weregild for an employee murdered by Deirdre Archleon. Dresden says \\"That's for your dead employee's family. Take care of them with it. And leave my people out of it. It ends here.\\"\\r\\nIn Rick Riordan's novel The Hammer of Thor, Hearthstone, an elf, must pay a wergild for his brother Andriron's death when they were children. Hearthstone, the older brother, was distracted and playing with rocks when a Brunnmigi emerged from a well and killed Andiron. Since Hearthstone was deaf, he didn't notice until it was too late. Hearthstone was forced, by their father, to skin the large beast by himself. To pay his wergild, he had to cover every piece of fur with gold earned from his father. Every meal and any freetime, among other things, cost Hearthstone earned gold. This task wasn't accomplished until years later, and his father, Alderman, was reluctant to consider the debt paid, but finally conceded that Hearthstone was released from the debt.","input":"Among the barbarian tribes what was the wergeld?"},{"output":"October 13, 1908","context":"","input":"When was the church of the nazarene founded?"},{"output":"Healthy People","context":"Healthy People is a program of a nationwide health-promotion and disease-prevention goals set by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

His hypothesis was controversial and not widely accepted until the 1950s, when numerous discoveries such as palaeomagnetism provided strong support for continental drift, and thereby a substantial basis for today's model of plate tectonics.[1][2] Wegener was involved in several expeditions to Greenland to study polar air circulation before the existence of the jet stream was accepted. Expedition participants made many meteorological observations and were the first to overwinter on the inland Greenland ice sheet and the first to bore ice cores on a moving Arctic glacier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlfred Wegener was born in Berlin on 1 November 1880 as the youngest of five children in a clergyman's family. His father, Richard Wegener, was a theologian and teacher of classical languages at the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster. In 1886 his family purchased a former manor house near Rheinsberg, which they used as a vacation home. Today there is an Alfred Wegener Memorial site and tourist information office in a nearby building that was once the local schoolhouse.[3] He was cousin to film pioneer Paul Wegener.\\r\\nWegener attended school at the K?llnisches Gymnasium on Wallstrasse in Berlin (a fact which is memorialized on a plaque on this protected building, now a school of music), graduating as the best in his class. Afterward he studied Physics, meteorology and Astronomy in Berlin, Heidelberg and Innsbruck. From 1902 to 1903 during his studies he was an assistant at the Urania astronomical observatory. He obtained a doctorate in astronomy in 1905 based on a dissertation written under the supervision of Julius Bauschinger at Friedrich Wilhelms University (today Humboldt University), Berlin. Wegener had always maintained a strong interest in the developing fields of meteorology and climatology and his studies afterwards focused on these disciplines.\\r\\nIn 1905 Wegener became an assistant at the Aeronautisches Observatorium Lindenberg near Beeskow. He worked there with his brother Kurt, two years his senior, who was likewise a scientist with an interest in meteorology and polar research. The two pioneered the use of weather balloons to track air masses. On a balloon ascent undertaken to carry out meteorological investigations and to test a celestial navigation method using a particular type of quadrant (Libellenquadrant), the Wegener brothers set a new record for a continuous balloon flight, remaining aloft 52.5 hours from April 5ÿ7, 1906.[4]\\r\\nIn that same year 1906, Wegener participated in the first of his four Greenland expeditions, later regarding this experience as marking a decisive turning point in his life. The expedition was led by the Dane Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen and charged with studying the last unknown portion of the northeastern coast of Greenland. During the expedition Wegener constructed the first meteorological station in Greenland near Danmarkshavn, where he launched kites and tethered balloons to make meteorological measurements in an Arctic climatic zone. Here Wegener also made his first acquaintance with death in a wilderness of ice when the expedition leader and two of his colleagues died on an exploratory trip undertaken with sled dogs.\\r\\nAfter his return in 1908 and until World War I, Wegener was a lecturer in meteorology, applied astronomy and cosmic physics at the University of Marburg. His students and colleagues in Marburg particularly valued his ability to clearly and understandably explain even complex topics and current research findings without sacrificing precision. His lectures formed the basis of what was to become a standard textbook in meteorology, first written In 1909/1910: Thermodynamik der Atmosph?re (Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere), in which he incorporated many of the results of the Greenland expedition.\\r\\nOn 6 January 1912 he publicized his first thoughts about continental drift in a lecture at a session of the Geologischen Vereinigung at the Senckenberg-Museum, Frankfurt am Main and in three articles in the journal Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen.[5]\\r\\nAfter a stopover in Iceland to purchase and test ponies as pack animals, the expedition arrived in Danmarkshavn. Even before the trip to the inland ice began the expedition was almost annihilated by a calving glacier. The Danish expedition leader, Johan Peter Koch, broke his leg when he fell into a glacier crevasse and spent months recovering in a sickbed. Wegener and Koch were the first to winter on the inland ice in northeast Greenland.[6] Inside their hut they drilled to a depth of 25 m with an auger. In summer 1913 the team crossed the inland ice, the four expedition participants covering a distance twice as long as Fridtjof Nansen's southern Greenland crossing in 1888. Only a few kilometers from the western Greenland settlement of Kangersuatsiaq the small team ran out of food while struggling to find their way through difficult glacial breakup terrain. But at the last moment, after the last pony and dog had been eaten, they were picked up at a fjord by the clergyman of Upernavik, who just happened to be visiting a remote congregation at the time.\\r\\nLater in 1913 after his return Wegener married Else K?ppen, the daughter of his former teacher and mentor, the meteorologist Wladimir K?ppen. The young pair lived in Marburg, where Wegner resumed his university lectureship.\\r\\nAs an infantry reserve officer Wegener was immediately called up when the First World War began in 1914. On the war front in Belgium he experienced fierce fighting but his term lasted only a few months: after being wounded twice he was declared unfit for active service and assigned to the army weather service. This activity required him to travel constantly between various weather stations in Germany, on the Balkans, on the Western Front and in the Baltic region.\\r\\nNevertheless, he was able in 1915 to complete the first version of his major work, Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane (The Origin of Continents and Oceans). His brother Kurt remarked that Alfred Wegeners motivation was to reestablish the connection between geophysics on the one hand and geography and geology on the other, which had become completely ruptured because of the specialized development of these branches of science.\\r\\nInterest in this small publication was however low, also because of wartime chaos. By the end of the war Wegener had published almost 20 additional meteorological and geophysical papers in which he repeatedly embarked for new scientific frontiers. In 1917 he undertook a scientific investigation of the Treysa meteorite.\\r\\nWegener obtained a position as a meteorologist at the German Naval Observatory (Deutsche Seewarte) and moved to Hamburg with his wife and their two daughters. In 1921 he was appointed senior lecturer at the new University of Hamburg. From 1919 to 1923 Wegener did pioneering work on reconstructing the climate of past eras (now known as \\"paleoclimatology\\"), closely in collaboration with Milutin Milankovi?,[7] publishing Die Klimate der geologischen Vorzeit (The Climates of the Geological Past) together with his father-in-law, Wladimir K?ppen, in 1924.[8] In 1922 the third, fully revised edition of The Origin of Continents and Oceans appeared, and discussion began on his theory of continental drift, first in the German language area and later internationally. Withering criticism was the response of most experts.\\r\\nIn 1924 Wegener was appointed to a professorship in meteorology and geophysics in Graz, which finally provided him with a secure position for himself and his family. He concentrated on physics and the optics of the atmosphere as well as the study of tornados. Scientific assessment of his second Greenland expedition (ice measurements, atmospheric optics, etc.) continued to the end of the 1920s.\\r\\nIn November 1926 Wegener presented his continental drift theory at a symposium of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in New York City, again earning rejection from everyone but the chairman. Three years later the fourth and final expanded edition of The Origin of Continents and Oceans appeared.\\r\\nIn 1929 Wegener embarked on his third trip to Greenland, which laid the groundwork for a later main expedition and included a test of an innovative, propeller-driven snowmobile.\\r\\nWegener's last Greenland expedition was in 1930. The 14 participants under his leadership were to establish three permanent stations from which the thickness of the Greenland ice sheet could be measured and year-round Arctic weather observations made. Wegener felt personally responsible for the expedition's success, as the German government had contributed $120,000 ($1.5 million in 2007 dollars). Success depended on enough provisions being transferred from West camp to Eismitte (\\"mid-ice\\") for two men to winter there, and this was a factor in the decision that led to his death. Owing to a late thaw, the expedition was six weeks behind schedule and, as summer ended, the men at Eismitte sent a message that they had insufficient fuel and so would return on 20 October.\\r\\nOn 24 September, although the route markers were by now largely buried under snow, Wegener set out with thirteen Greenlanders and his meteorologist Fritz Loewe to supply the camp by dog sled. During the journey, the temperature reached ?60?C (?76?F) and Loewe's toes became so frostbitten they had to be amputated with a penknife without anesthetic. Twelve of the Greenlanders returned to West camp. On 19 October the remaining three members of the expedition reached Eismitte. There being only enough supplies for three at Eismitte, Wegener and Rasmus Villumsen took two dog sleds and made for West camp. They took no food for the dogs and killed them one by one to feed the rest until they could run only one sled. While Villumsen rode the sled, Wegener had to use skis, but they never reached the camp: Wegener died and Villumsen was never seen again. The expedition was completed by his brother, Kurt Wegener.\\r\\nThis expedition inspired the Greenland expedition episode of Adam Melfort in John Buchan's 1933 novel A Prince of the Captivity.\\r\\nWegener died in Clarinetania, Greenland, in November 1930. Villumsen had buried the body with great care, and a pair of skis marked the grave site. After burying Wegener, Villumsen had resumed his journey to West camp, but was never seen again. Six months later, on 12 May 1931, Wegener's body was found halfway between Eismitte and West camp. The team that found him reburied his body in the same spot and marked the grave with a large cross. Wegener had been 50 years of age and a heavy smoker, and it was believed that he had died of heart failure brought on by overexertion. Villumsen was 23 when he died, and it is estimated that his body, and Wegener's diary, now lie under more than 100 metres (330?ft) of accumulated ice and snow.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlfred Wegener first thought of this idea by noticing that the different large landmasses of the Earth almost fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The Continental shelf of the Americas fit closely to Africa and Europe, and Antarctica, Australia, India and Madagascar fitted next to the tip of Southern Africa. But Wegener only published his idea after reading a paper in 1911 which criticized the prevalent hypothesis, that a bridge of land once connected Europe and America, on the grounds that this contradicts isostasy.[9] Wegener's main interest was meteorology, and he wanted to join the Denmark-Greenland expedition scheduled for mid-1912. He presented his Continental Drift hypothesis on 6 January 1912. He analyzed both sides of the Atlantic Ocean for rock type, geological structures and fossils. He noticed that there was a significant similarity between matching sides of the continents, especially in fossil plants.\\r\\nFrom 1912, Wegener publicly advocated the existence of \\"continental drift\\", arguing that all the continents were once joined together in a single landmass and had since drifted apart. He supposed that the mechanisms causing the drift might be the centrifugal force of the Earth's rotation (\\"Polflucht\\") or the astronomical precession. Wegener also speculated on sea-floor spreading and the role of the mid-ocean ridges, stating: the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ... zone in which the floor of the Atlantic, as it keeps spreading, is continuously tearing open and making space for fresh, relatively fluid and hot sima [rising] from depth.[10] However, he did not pursue these ideas in his later works.\\r\\nIn 1915, in the first edition of his book, Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane, written in German (the first English edition was published in 1924 as The Origin of Continents and Oceans, a translation of the 1922 third German edition),[11] Wegener drew together evidence from various fields to advance the theory that there had once been a giant continent which he named \\"Urkontinent\\"[12] (German for \\"primal continent\\", analogous to the Greek \\"Pangaea\\",[13] meaning \\"All-Lands\\" or \\"All-Earth\\"). Expanded editions during the 1920s presented further evidence. The last German edition, published in 1929, revealed the significant observation that shallower oceans were geologically younger. It was, however, not translated into English until 1962.[11]\\r\\nIn his work, Wegener presented a large amount of observational evidence in support of continental drift, but the mechanism remained a problem, partly because Wegener's estimate of the velocity of continental motion, 250?cm/year, was too high.[14] (The currently accepted rate for the separation of the Americas from Europe and Africa is about 2.5?cm/year).[15]\\r\\nWhile his ideas attracted a few early supporters such as Alexander Du Toit from South Africa, Arthur Holmes in England [16] and Milutin Milankovi? in Serbia for whom continental drift theory was the premise in investigating polar wandering,[17][18] the hypothesis was initially met with skepticism from geologists who viewed Wegener as an outsider, and were resistant to change.[16] The one American edition of Wegener's work, published in 1925, which was written in \\"a dogmatic style that often results from German translations\\",[16] was received so poorly that the American Association of Petroleum Geologists organized a symposium specifically in opposition to the continental drift hypothesis.[19] The opponents argued, as did the Leipziger geologist Franz Kossmat, that the oceanic crust was too firm for the continents to \\"simply plough through\\".\\r\\nFrom at least 1910, Wegener imagined the continents once fitting together not at the current shore line, but 200 m below this, at the level of the continental shelves, where they match well.[16] Part of the reason Wegener's ideas were not initially accepted was the misapprehension that he was suggesting the continents had fit along the current coastline.[16] Charles Schuchert commented:\\r\\nDuring this vast time [of the split of Pangea] the sea waves have been continuously pounding against Africa and Brazil and in many places rivers have been bringing into the ocean great amounts of eroded material, yet everywhere the geographic shore lines are said to have remained practically unchanged! It apparently makes no difference to Wegener how hard or how soft are the rocks of these shore lines, what are their geological structures that might aid or retard land or marine erosion, how often the strand lines have been elevated or depressed, and how far peneplanation has gone on during each period of continental stability. Furthermore, sea-level in itself has not been constant, especially during the Pleistocene, when the lands were covered by millions of square miles of ice made from water subtracted out of the oceans. In the equatorial regions, this level fluctuated three times during the Pleistocene, and during each period of ice accumulation the sea-level sank about 250 feet [75 m].[citation needed]\\r\\nWegener was in the audience for this lecture, but made no attempt to defend his work, possibly because of an inadequate command of the English language.\\r\\nIn 1943 George Gaylord Simpson wrote a strong critique of the theory (as well as the rival theory of sunken land bridges) and gave evidence for the idea that similarities of flora and fauna between the continents could best be explained by these being fixed land masses which over time were connected and disconnected by periodic flooding, a theory known as permanentism.[20] Alexander du Toit wrote a rejoinder to this the following year.[21]\\r\\nIn the early 1950s, the new science of paleomagnetism pioneered at the University of Cambridge by S. K. Runcorn and at Imperial College by P.M.S. Blackett was soon producing data in favour of Wegener's theory. By early 1953 samples taken from India showed that the country had previously been in the Southern hemisphere as predicted by Wegener. By 1959, the theory had enough supporting data that minds were starting to change, particularly in the United Kingdom where, in 1964, the Royal Society held a symposium on the subject.[22]\\r\\nAdditionally, the 1960s saw several developments in geology, notably the discoveries of seafloor spreading and WadatiÿBenioff zones, and this led to the rapid resurrection of the continental drift hypothesis and its direct descendant, the theory of plate tectonics. Maps of the geomorphology of the ocean floors created by Marie Tharp in cooperation with Bruce Heezen were an important contribution to the paradigm shift that was starting. Wegener was then recognized as the founding father of one of the major scientific revolutions of the 20th century.\\r\\nWith the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS), it became possible to measure continental drift directly.[23]\\r\\nThe Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, was established in 1980 on his centenary. It awards the Wegener Medal in his name.[24] The crater Wegener on the Moon and the crater Wegener on Mars, as well as the asteroid 29227 Wegener and the peninsula where he died in Greenland (Wegener Peninsula near Ummannaq, 7112N 5150W? / ?71.200N 51.833W? / 71.200; -51.833), are named after him.[25]\\r\\nThe European Geosciences Union sponsors an Alfred Wegener Medal & Honorary Membership \\"for scientists who have achieved exceptional international standing in atmospheric, hydrological or ocean sciences, defined in their widest senses, for their merit and their scientific achievements.\\"[26]","input":"Who was the german meteorologist who pioneered the theory of continental drift and plate tectonics?"},{"output":"Hudson River","context":"The Hudson River is a 315-mile (507?km) river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States. The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, flows through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean, between New York City and Jersey City. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York, and further north between New York counties. The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary occupying the Hudson Fjord, an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago.[2] Tidal waters influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as Troy.\\r\\nThe river is named after Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company, who explored it in 1609, and after whom Canada's Hudson Bay is also named. It had previously been observed by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailing for King Francis I of France in 1524, as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay, but he considered the river to be an estuary. The Dutch called the river the North River ÿ with the Delaware River called the South River ÿ and it formed the spine of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson, and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony.\\r\\nDuring the eighteenth century, the river valley and its inhabitants were the subject and inspiration of Washington Irving, the first internationally acclaimed American author. In the nineteenth century, the area inspired the Hudson River School of landscape painting, an American pastoral style, as well as the concepts of environmentalism and wilderness. The Hudson was also the eastern outlet for the Erie Canal, which, when completed in 1825, became an important transportation artery for the early-19th-century United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe source of the Hudson River is Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondack Park at an altitude of 4,322 feet (1,317?m).[4] The river is not cartographically called the Hudson River until miles downstream. The river is named Feldspar Brook until its confluence with Calamity Brook, and then is named Calamity Brook until the river reaches Indian Pass Brook, flowing south from the outlet of Henderson Lake. From that point on, the stream is cartographically known as the Hudson River.[5][6][7]\\r\\nAlthough numerous sources show the river originating directly at Henderson Lake, per the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the river cartographically begins at the confluence of Indian Pass Brook and Calamity Brook near the outlet of Henderson Lake in Newcomb, in the Adirondack Park.[3]\\r\\nThe longest source of the Hudson River as shown on the most detailed USGS maps is the \\"Opalescent River\\" on the west slopes of Little Marcy Mountain, originating two miles north of Lake Tear of the Clouds, and a mile longer than \\"Feldspar Brook\\", which flows out of that lake in the Adirondack Mountains. Popular culture and convention, however, more often cite the photogenic Lake Tear of the Clouds as the source.\\r\\nSouth of the confluence of Indian Pass Brook and Calamity Brook, the Hudson River flows south into Sanford Lake. South of the outlet of the lake, the Opalescent River flows into the Hudson. The Hudson then flows south, taking in Beaver Brook and the outlet of Lake Harris. After its confluence with the Indian River, the Hudson forms the boundary between Essex and Hamilton counties. In the hamlet of North River, the Hudson flows entirely in Warren County and takes in the Schroon River. Further south, the river forms the boundary between Warren and Saratoga Counties. The river then takes in the Sacandaga River from the Great Sacandaga Lake. Shortly thereafter, the river leaves the Adirondack Park, flows under Interstate 87, and through Glens Falls, just south of Lake George although receiving no streamflow from the lake. It next goes through Hudson Falls. At this point the river forms the boundary between Washington and Saratoga Counties.[7] Here the river has an altitude of 200 feet.[4] Just south in Fort Edward, the river reaches its confluence with the Champlain Canal,[7] which historically provided boat traffic between New York City and Montreal and the rest of Eastern Canada via the Hudson, Lake Champlain and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.[8] Further south the Hudson takes in water from the Batten Kill River and Fish Creek near Schuylerville. The river then forms the boundary between Saratoga and Rensselaer counties. The river then enters the heart of the Capital District. It takes in water from the Hoosic River, which extends into Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter the river has its confluence with the Mohawk River, the largest tributary of the Hudson River, in Waterford.[4][7] The river then reaches the Federal Dam in Troy, marking an impoundment of the river.[7] At an elevation of 2 feet (0.61?m), the bottom of the dam marks the beginning of the tidal influence in the Hudson as well as the beginning of the lower Hudson River.[4]\\r\\nSouth of the Federal Dam, the Hudson River begins to widen considerably. The river enters the Hudson Valley, flowing along the west bank of Albany and the east bank of Rensselaer. Interstate 90 crosses the Hudson into Albany at this point in the river. The Hudson then leaves the Capital District, forming the boundary between Greene and Columbia Counties. It then meets its confluence with Schodack Creek, widening considerably at this point. After flowing by Hudson, the river then forms the boundary between Ulster and Columbia Counties and Ulster and Dutchess Counties, passing Germantown and Kingston. The Delaware and Hudson Canal meets the river at this point. The river then flows by Hyde Park, former residence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and alongside the city of Poughkeepsie, flowing under the Walkway over the Hudson and the Mid-Hudson Bridge. Afterwards, the Hudson passes Wappingers Falls and takes in Wappinger Creek. The river then forms the boundary between Orange and Dutchess Counties. It flows between Newburgh and Beacon and under the Newburgh Beacon Bridge, taking in the Fishkill Creek. In this area, between Gee's Point at the US Military Academy and Constitution Island, an area known as \\"World's End\\" marks the deepest part of the Hudson, at 202 feet (62?m).[9] Shortly thereafter, the river enters the Hudson Highlands between Putnam and Orange Counties, flowing between mountains such as Storm King Mountain, Breakneck Ridge, and Bear Mountain. The river narrows considerably here before flowing under the Bear Mountain Bridge, which connects Westchester and Rockland Counties.[7]\\r\\nAfterward, leaving the Hudson Highlands, the river enters Haverstraw Bay, the widest point of the river at 3.5 miles (5.6?km) wide.[4] Shortly thereafter, the river forms the Tappan Zee and flows under the Tappan Zee Bridge, which carries the New York State Thruway between Tarrytown and Nyack in Westchester and Rockland Counties respectively. South of the Tappan Zee Bridge, the west bank of the Hudson becomes Bergen and Hudson Counties of New Jersey, and further south the east bank of the river becomes Yonkers and then the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City. The Palisades, large, rocky cliffs along the west bank of the river, begin along the west bank of the river opposite the Bronx. South of the confluence of the Hudson and Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the east bank of the river becomes Manhattan.[7] The river is sometimes still called the North River at this point. The George Washington Bridge crosses the river between Fort Lee and the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.[10] The Lincoln Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel also cross under the river between Manhattan and New Jersey. South of the Battery, the river proper ends, meeting the East River to form Upper New York Bay, also known as New York Harbor. Its outflow continues through the Narrows between Brooklyn and Staten Island, under the Verrazano Bridge, and into Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.[7]\\r\\nThe lower Hudson is actually a tidal estuary, with tidal influence extending as far as the Federal Dam in Troy. Strong tides make parts of New York Harbor difficult and dangerous to navigate. During the winter, ice floes may drift south or north, depending upon the tides. The Mahican name of the river represents its partially estuarine nature: muh-he-kun-ne-tuk means \\"the river that flows both ways.\\"[11] The Hudson is often mistaken for one of the largest rivers in the United States, but it is an estuary throughout most of its length below Troy and thus only a small fraction of fresh water, about 15,000?cubic feet (425?m3) per second, is present. The mean fresh water discharge at the river's mouth in New York is approximately 21,400?cubic feet (606?m3) per second. The Hudson and its tributaries, notably the Mohawk River, drain a large area. Parts of the Hudson River form coves, such as Weehawken Cove in the towns of Hoboken and Weehawken in New Jersey.\\r\\nThe salt line of the river varies from the north in Poughkeepsie to the south at Battery Park in New York City, though it usually lies near Newburgh.[12]:11\\r\\nThe Hudson is sometimes called, in geological terms, a drowned river. The rising sea levels after the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation, the most recent ice age, have resulted in a marine incursion that drowned the coastal plain and brought salt water well above the mouth of the river. The deeply eroded old riverbed beyond the current shoreline, Hudson Canyon, is a rich fishing area. The former riverbed is clearly delineated beneath the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, extending to the edge of the continental shelf.[13]\\r\\nAlong the river, the Palisades are of metamorphic basalt, or diabases, the Highlands are primarily granite and gneiss with intrusions, and from Beacon to Albany, shales and limestones, or mainly sedimentary rock.[12]:13\\r\\nThe Narrows were most likely formed about 6,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. Previously, Staten Island and Long Island were connected, preventing the Hudson River from terminating via the Narrows. At that time, the Hudson River emptied into the Atlantic Ocean through a more westerly course through parts of present-day northern New Jersey, along the eastern side of the Watchung Mountains to Bound Brook, New Jersey and then on into the Atlantic Ocean via Raritan Bay. A buildup of water in the Upper New York Bay eventually allowed the Hudson River to break through previous land mass that was connecting Staten Island and Brooklyn to form the Narrows as it exists today. This allowed the Hudson River to find a shorter route to the Atlantic Ocean via its present course between New Jersey and New York City.[14]\\r\\nThe river was called Ca-ho-ha-ta-te-a (\\"the river\\")[15] by the Iroquois, and it was known as Muh-he-kun-ne-tuk (\\"river that flows two ways\\") by the Mohican tribe who formerly inhabited both banks of the lower portion of the river. The Delaware Tribe of Indians (Bartlesville, Oklahoma) considers the closely related Mohicans to be a part of the Lenape people,[16] and so the Lenape also claim the Hudson as part of their ancestral territory, naming the river Muhheakantuck (\\"river that flows two ways\\").[17]\\r\\nThe first known European name for the river was the Rio San Antonio as named by the Portuguese explorer in Spain's employ, Estv?o Gomes, who explored the Mid-Atlantic coast in 1525.[18] Another early name for the Hudson used by the Dutch was Rio de Montaigne.[19] Later, they generally termed it the Noortrivier, or \\"North River\\", the Delaware River being known as the Zuidrivier, or \\"South River\\". Other occasional names for the Hudson included: Manhattes rieviere \\"Manhattan River\\", Groote Rivier \\"Great River\\", and de grootte Mouritse reviere, or \\"the Great Mouritse River\\" (Mourits is a Dutch surname).[20] The translated name North River was used in the New York metropolitan area up until the early 1900s, with limited use continuing into the present day.[21] The term persists in radio communication among commercial shipping traffic, especially below the Tappan Zee.[22] The term also continues to be used in names of facilities in the river's southern portion, such as the North River piers, North River Tunnels, and the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant. It is believed that the first use of the name Hudson River in a map was in a map created by the cartographer John Carwitham in 1740.[23]\\r\\nIn 1939, the magazine Life described the river as \\"America's Rhine\\", comparing it to the 40-mile (64?km) stretch of the Rhine in Central and Western Europe.[24]\\r\\nVarious stretches of the river have their own historical names, many created by early Dutch explorers and settlers. The stretches all have similar sailing conditions, and the names were commonly used until the early common use of the steamboat. These names include, from north to south: the Great Chip Reach, Tappan Reach, Haverstroo Reach, Seylmakers' Reach, Crescent or Cook's Reach, Hoge's or High Reach, Martyr's or Martelaire Reach, Fisher's Reach, Lange Rack or Long Reach, Vasterack or Vaste Reach, Kleverack or Claverack, Backerack or Baker's Reach, Jan Playsier's Reach, and Hart's or Hunter's Reach.[12]:10\\r\\nThe area around Hudson River was inhabited by indigenous peoples ages before Europeans arrived. The Lenape, Wappinger, and Mahican branches of the Algonquins lived along the river,[25] mostly in peace with the other groups.[25][26] The Algonquins in the region mainly lived in small clans and villages throughout the area. One major settlement was called Navish, which was located at Croton Point, overlooking the Hudson River. Other settlements were located in various locations throughout the Hudson Highlands. Many villagers lived in various types of houses, which the Algonquins called wigwams, though large families often lived in longhouses that could be a hundred feet long.[26] At the associated villages, they grew corn, beans, and squash. They also gathered other types of plant foods, such as hickory nuts and many other wild fruits and tubers. In addition to agriculture, the Algonquins also fished in the Hudson River, focusing on various species of freshwater fish, as well as various variations of striped bass, American eels, sturgeon, herring, and shad. Oyster beds were also common on the river floor, which provided an extra source of nutrition. Land hunting consisted of turkey, deer, bear, and other animals.[26]\\r\\nThe lower Hudson River was inhabited by the Lenape,[26] while further north, the Wappingers lived from Manhattan Island up to Poughkeepsie. They traded with both the Lenape to the south and the Mahicans to the north.[25] The Mahicans lived in the northern part of the valley from present-day Kingston to Lake Champlain,[26] with their capital located near present-day Albany.[25]\\r\\nJohn Cabot is credited for the Old World's discovery of continental North America, with his journey in 1497 along the continent's coast. In 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed north along the Atlantic seaboard and into New York Harbor,[18] however he left the harbor shortly thereafter, without navigating into the Hudson River.[27] In 1598, Dutch men employed by the Greenland Company wintered in New York Bay.[18] Eleven years later, the Dutch East India Company financed English navigator Henry Hudson in his search for the Northwest Passage. During the search, Hudson decided to sail his ship up the river that would later be named after him. His travel up the ever-widening river led him to Haverstraw Bay, leading him to believe he had successfully reached the Northwest Passage. He landed on the western shore the bay and claimed the territory for the Netherlands. He then proceeded upstream as far as present-day Troy before concluding that no such strait existed there.[28]\\r\\nThe Dutch subsequently began to colonize the region, establishing the colony of New Netherland, including three major fur-trading outposts: New Amsterdam, Wiltwyck, and Fort Orange.[29][30] New Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Hudson River, and would later become known as New York City. Wiltwyck was founded roughly halfway up the Hudson River, and would later become Kingston. Fort Orange was founded on the river north of Wiltwyck, and later became known as Albany.[29] The Dutch West India Company operated a monopoly on the region for roughly twenty years before other businessmen were allowed to set up their own ventures in the colony.[29] In 1647, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took over management of the colony, and surrendered it in 1664 to the British, who had invaded the largely-defenseless New Amsterdam.[29][31] New Amsterdam and the colony of New Netherland were renamed New York, after the Duke of York.[31]\\r\\nUnder British colonial rule, the Hudson Valley became an agricultural hub. Manors were developed on the east side of the river, and the west side contained many smaller and independent farms.[32] In 1754, the Albany Plan of Union was created at Albany City Hall on the Hudson.[33][34] The plan allowed the colonies to treaty with the Iroquois and provided a framework for the Continental Congress.[35][36]\\r\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British realized that the river's proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain would allow their navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City.[37] British general John Burgoyne planned the Saratoga campaign, to control the river and therefore cut off the patriot hub of New England (to the river's east) from the South and Mid-Atlantic regions to the river's west. The action would allow the British to focus on rallying the support of loyalists in the southerly states.[38] As a result, numerous battles were fought along the river and in nearby waterways. These include the Battle of Long Island, in August 1776[39] and the Battle of Harlem Heights the following month.[40] Later that year, the British and Continental Armies were involved in skirmishes and battles in rivertowns of the Hudson in Westchester County, culminating in the Battle of White Plains.[41]\\r\\nAlso in late 1776, New England militias fortified the river's choke point known as the Hudson Highlands, which included building Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery on either side of the Hudson and a metal chain between the two. In 1777, Washington expected the British would attempt to control the Hudson River, however they instead conquered Philadelphia, and left a smaller force in New York City, with permission to strike the Hudson Valley at any time. The British attacked on October 5, 1777 in the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery by sailing up the Hudson River, looting the village of Peeksill and capturing the two forts.[42] In 1778, the Continentals constructed the Great West Point Chain in order to prevent another British fleet from sailing up the Hudson.[43]\\r\\nHudson River School paintings reflect the themes of discovery, exploration, and settlement in America in the 19th century.[44] The detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting. The works often juxtapose peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity.[45] The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River.[46] In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of the American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God,[47] though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction.[48] Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson.[49] The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School,[50] while painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school.[46]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, transportation from the US east coast into the mainland was difficult. Ships were the fastest vehicles at the time, as trains and automobiles were still being developed. In order to facilitate shipping throughout the country's interior, numerous canals were constructed between internal bodies of water in the 1800s.[51][52] One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal, built to link the Midwest to the Port of New York, a significant seaport during that time.[52] The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West, allowing settlers to travel west, send goods to markets in frontier cities, and export goods via the Hudson River and New York City. The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation, surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts.[52][53][54] After the completion of the Erie Canal, smaller canals were built to connect it with the new system. The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain. This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway, and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City.[54] Another major canal was the Oswego Canal, which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario, and could be used to bypass Niagara Falls.[54] The Cayuga-Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake.[54] Farther south, the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale, Pennsylvania, and the Hudson River at Kingston, New York. This canal enabled the transportation of coal, and later other goods as well, between the Delaware and Hudson River watersheds.[55] The combination of these canals made the Hudson River one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation.[54]\\r\\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the Hudson River became a major location for production, especially around Albany and Troy. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast. Hundreds of factories were built around the Hudson, in towns including Poughkeepise, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The North Tarrytown Assembly (later owned by General Motors), on the river in Sleepy Hollow, was a large and notable example. The River links to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes, allowing manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, to use the river for transport.[56](pp71ÿ2) With industrialization came new technologies for transport, including steamboats for faster transport. In 1807, the North River Steamboat (later known as Clermont), became the first commercially successful steamboat. It carried passengers between New York City and Albany along the Hudson River.[57]\\r\\nThe Hudson River valley also proved to be a good area for railroads. The Hudson River Railroad was established in 1849 on the east side of the river as a way to bring passengers from New York City to Albany. The line was built as an alternative to the New York and Harlem Railroad for travel to Albany, and as a way to ease the concerns of cities along the river. The railroad was also used for commuting to New York City.[58] Further north, the Livingston Avenue Bridge was opened in 1866 as a way to connect the Hudson River Railroad with the New York Central Railroad, which goes west to Buffalo.[59][60] Smaller railroads existed north of this point.[61] On the west side of the Hudson River, the West Shore Railroad opened to run passenger service from Weehawken, New Jersey to Albany, and then Buffalo.[62] In 1889, the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge opened for rail service between Poughkeepsie and the west side of the river.[63]\\r\\nStarting in the 20th century, the technological requirements needed to build large crossings across the river were met. This was especially important by New York City, as the river is fairly wide at that point. In 1927, the Holland Tunnel opened between New Jersey and Lower Manhattan. The tunnel was the longest underwater tunnel in the world at the time, and used an advanced system to ventilate the tunnels and prevent the build-up of carbon monoxide.[64][65] The original upper level of the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel followed in the 1930s.[66] In 1955, the original Tappan Zee Bridge was built over one of the widest parts of the river, from Tarrytown to Nyack.[67][68][69]\\r\\nThe late 20th century saw a decline in industrial production in the Hudson Valley. In 1993, IBM closed two of its plants in East Fishkill and Kingston due to IBM losing $16 billion over the previous three years. The plant in East Fishkill had 16,300 workers at its peak in 1984, and had opened in 1941 originally as part of the war effort.[70] In 1996, the North Tarrytown GM Plant closed.[71] In response to the plant closures, towns throughout the region sought to make the region attractive for technology companies. IBM maintained a Poughkeepsie mainframe unit, and newer housing and office developments were built near there as well. Commuting from Poughkeepsie to New York City also increased.[70] Developers also looked to build on the property of the old GM plant.[71]\\r\\nAround the time of the last factories' closing, environmental efforts to clean up the river progressed. For example, GE participated in cleanup efforts to remove PCBs from the site of its old factory in Hudson Falls. The cleanup is part of an EPA Superfund site, and consists of dredging a 40-mile stretch of the river the Troy Dam to Fort Edward in order to remove the probable carcinogen from the ecosystem.[72] Other conservation efforts also occurred, such as when Christopher Swain became the first person to swim all 315 miles of the Hudson River in support of cleaning it up.[73]\\r\\nIn conjunction with conservation efforts, the Hudson River region has seen an economic revitalization, especially in favor of green development. In 2009, the High Line was opened in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. This linear park has views of the river throughout its length.[74] Also in 2009, the original Poughkeepsie railroad bridge, since abandoned, was converted into the Walkway Over the Hudson, a pedestrian park over the river.[63] Emblematic of the increase in green development in the region, waterfront parks in cities like Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and Beacon were built, and several festivals are held annually.[75]\\r\\nNumerous landmarks have been constructed along the Hudson. Following the river from its source to mouth, there is the Hudson River Islands State Park in Greene and Columbia counties, and in Dutchess County, there is Bard College, Staatsburgh, the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site, Franklin D. Roosevelt's home and presidential library, and the main campus of the Culinary Institute of America, Marist College, the Walkway over the Hudson, Bannerman's Castle, and Hudson Highlands State Park. South of that in Orange County is the United States Military Academy. In Westchester lies Indian Point Energy Center, Croton Point Park, and Sing Sing Correctional Facility. In New Jersey is Stevens Institute of Technology and Liberty State Park. In Manhattan is Fort Tryon Park with the Cloisters, and the World Trade Center. Ellis Island is located just south of the river's mouth in New York Harbor. The Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island, is located a bit further south of there.[76]\\r\\nA 30-mile (48?km) stretch on the east bank of the Hudson has been designated the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark.[77] The Palisades Interstate Park Commission protects the Palisades on the west bank of the river. The Hudson River was designated as an American Heritage River in 1997.[78] The Hudson River estuary system is part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System as the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve.[79]\\r\\nThe Hudson River is navigable by large steamers up to Troy, and by ocean-faring vessels to the Port of Albany.[12]:11 The original Erie Canal, opened in 1825 to connect the Hudson with Lake Erie, emptied into the Hudson at the Albany Basin, just 3 miles (4.8?km) south of the Federal Dam in Troy (at mile 134). The canal enabled shipping between cities on the Great Lakes and Europe via the Atlantic Ocean.[13] The New York State Canal System, the successor to the Erie Canal, runs into the Hudson River north of Troy.[80] It also uses the Federal Dam as a lock.[81]\\r\\nAlong the east side of the river runs the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line, from Manhattan to Poughkeepsie.[82] The tracks continue north of Poughkeepsie as Amtrak trains run further north to Albany.[82] On the west side of the river, CSX Transportation operates a freight rail line between North Bergen Yard in North Bergen, New Jersey and Selkirk Yard in Selkirk, New York.[83][84][85]\\r\\nThe Hudson is crossed at numerous points by bridges, tunnels, and ferries. The width of the Lower Hudson River required major feats of engineering to cross, the results today visible in the George Washington Bridge and the Tappan Zee Bridge (being replaced by the New Tappan Zee Bridge) as well as the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the PATH and Pennsylvania Railroad tubes. The George Washington Bridge, which carries multiple highways, connects Fort Lee, New Jersey to the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, and is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge.[10] The Tappan Zee Bridge is the longest bridge in New York, although the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has a larger main span. The Troy Union Bridge between Waterford and Troy was the first bridge over the Hudson; built in 1804 and destroyed in 1909;[86] its replacement, the TroyÿWaterford Bridge, was built in 1909.[87] The Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad was chartered in 1832 and opened in 1835, including the Green Island Bridge, the second bridge over the Hudson south of the Federal Dam.[88]\\r\\nThe most discussed pollution of the Hudson River is General Electric's contamination of the river with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) between 1947 and 1977.[89] This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who ate fish from the river or drank the water.[90][91] In response to this contamination, activists protested in various ways. Musician Pete Seeger founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the Clearwater Festival to draw attention to the problem. Environmental activism led to passage of the federal Clean Water Act as well as federal government designation of the river as a Superfund site.[92] Other kinds of pollution, including mercury contamination and sewage dumping, have also caused problems.[93][94]\\r\\nExtensive remediation actions on the river began in the 1970s with the implementation of wastewater discharge permits and consequent reduction of wastewater discharges, and sediment removal operations, which have continued into the 21st century.[95]\\r\\nOther environmental groups focusing on the river include Scenic Hudson, Hudson River Foundation, Riverkeeper, Hudson River Environmental Society, Hudson River Watertrail Association, and Groundwork Hudson Valley.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to the NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program, about 220 species of fish, including 173 native species, currently are found in the Hudson River.[96] These include striped bass, the most important game fish in the Hudson. Estimates of the striped bass population in the Hudson range to nearly 100 million fish.[97][98] American eels also live in the river before reaching breeding age; for much of this stage they are known as glass eels because of the transparency of their bodies. The fish are the only catadromous species in the Hudson's estuary.[99]\\r\\nThe Atlantic tomcod are a unique species that adapted resistance to the toxic effects of the PCBs polluting the river. Scientists identified the genetic mutation that conferred the resistance, and found that the mutated form was present in 99 percent of the tomcods in the river, compared to fewer than 10 percent of the tomcods from other waters.[99][100]\\r\\nThe hogchoker flatfish have been historically abundant in the river, where farmers would use them for inexpensive livestock feed, giving the fish its name.[99] Other unique fish found in the river include the northern pipefish, the lined seahorse, and the northern puffer.[99]\\r\\nThe Atlantic sturgeon, a species about 120 million years old, enter the estuary during their annual migrations. The fish grow to a considerable size, up to 15 feet (4.6?m) and 800 pounds (360?kg).[99] The fish are the symbol of the Hudson River Estuary. Their smoked flesh was commonly eaten in the river valley since 1779, and it was sometimes known as \\"Albany beef\\". The city of Albany was called \\"Sturgeondom\\" or \\"Sturgeontown\\" in the 1850s and 1860s, with its residents known as \\"Sturgeonites\\". The \\"Sturgeondom\\" name lost popularity around 1900.[101]\\r\\nMarine life is known to exist in the estuary, with seals, crabs, and some whales reported. On March 29, 1647, a white whale swam up the river to the Rensselaerswyck (near Albany). Herman Melville, author of Moby-Dick, lived in and near Albany from 1830 to 1847, and was known to have ancestry from New Netherland, leading some to believe stories of the whale sighting inspired his novel.[102]\\r\\nParkland surrounds much of the Hudson River; prominent parks include Battery Park and Liberty State Park at the river's mouth, Riverside Park in Manhattan, Croton Point Park, Bear Mountain State Park, Storm King State Park and the Hudson Highlands, Moreau Lake State Park, and its source in the High Peaks Wilderness Area.\\r\\nFishing is allowed in the river, although the state Department of Health recommends eating no fish caught from the South Glens Falls Dam to the Federal Dam at Troy. Women under 50 and children under 15 are not advised to eat any fish caught south of the Palmer Falls Dam in Corinth, while others are advised to eat anywhere from one to four meals per month of Hudson River fish, depending on species and location caught. The Department of Health cites mercury, PCBs, dioxin, and cadmium as the chemicals impacting fish in these areas.[103][104]","input":"What is the largest river in new york?"},{"output":"Arizona Diamondbacks","context":"The Kane County Cougars are a Class A Minor League Baseball team, affiliated with the Arizona Diamondbacks,[2] that plays in the Midwest League.

These figures include a significant number of registered plug-in electric cars and vans which were not eligible for the grant schemes.[9] The UK ranked in 2016 as the second best-selling European market after Norway, with almost 37,000 plug-in cars registered.[11]\\r\\nThere was a surge of plug-in car sales in Britain during 2014 and the following years: total registrations were 3,586 in 2013, but 36,907 plug-in electric cars were registered in 2016, 1.37% of total UK new car registrations.[6] Plug-in car sales in March 2017 achieved the best monthly plug-in registration volume on record ever with over 8,000 units,[12][13] and registrations during the first quarter of 2017 achieved a record 1.47% market share of new car sales during this quarter.[12]\\r\\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV is the all-time top selling plug-in car in the UK with 26,600 units registered through December 2016, accounting for about 50% of all plug-in hybrid sold in the UK since 2010.[14][15] The Nissan Leaf ranks second and it is also the all-time top selling all-electric car with 15,000 units sold by September 2016.[16] Ranking third is the BMW i3 with 4,457 units, followed by the Renault Zoe with 4,339 units, both, registered at the end of June 2016.[17]\\r\\nThe Plug-in Car Grant (PICG) programme started on 1 January 2011 and is available across the UK. The programme initially reduced the up-front cost of eligible cars by providing a 25% grant towards the cost of new plug-in cars capped at GBS5,000.[18][19] The programme was extended in February 2012 to include plug-in vans. Van buyers can receive 20% - up to GBS8,000 - off the cost of a plug-in van.[20] As plug-in car sales surged during 2014 and 2015, the PICG was extended until March 2018. The maximum grant was reduced to GBS4,500, and the amount granted varies according to emission levels. The eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of three categories depending on emission levels (CO2 emissions bands between 50 and 75g/km) and zero-emission-capable mileage (minimum of 10?mi (16?km)). Hydrogen fuel cell cars are now eligible for the grant. A price cap is in place for the extension for Category 2 and 3 models with a list price of more than GBS60,000, which are no longer eligible for the grant.[21][22] As of December?2017[update], a total of 127,509 eligible cars have been registered since the launch of the Plug-in Car Grant in 2011,[7] and, as of December?2016[update], the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 2,938 units since the launch of the programme in 2012.[23] The Plug-In Van Grant scheme was extended in October 2016 to make electric trucks above 3.5 tonnes eligible for grants of up to GBS20,000[24] As of 10?January?2017[update], the UK had 11,837 public charging points at 4,237 locations, of which 2,173 were rapid charging points at 695 locations.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking at the G8 summit in 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced plans for Britain to be at the forefront of a \\"green car revolution\\". Mr Brown suggested that by 2020 all new cars sold in Britain could be electric or hybrid vehicles producing less than 100 grams of CO2 per kilometre (5.7?oz(CO2)/mi).[26] In preparation for the introduction of mass-produced electric vehicles to Britain's roads, trials of electric cars took place from 2009, with further trials in cities across the UK from 2010. Local councils were invited to submit bids to become Britain's first \\"green cities\\". One example is Glasgow, where a Scottish consortium has been awarded more than GBS1.8 million to run a pilot electric car scheme from 2009 to 2011.[27]\\r\\nLondon mayor Boris Johnson also announced plans in April 2009 to deliver 25,000 electric car-charging places across the capital by 2015, in order to make London the \\"electric car capital of Europe\\". His target is to get 100,000 electric vehicles on to London's streets. Mr Johnson has also pledged to convert at least 1,000 Greater London Authority fleet vehicles to electric by 2015.[27][28] Transport for London also announced that all new taxis must be zero emissions capable by 2018.[29] As of June?2014[update], there were about 3,000 plug-in electric vehicles in London, 3% of the mayor's goal, up from 1,700 electric cars in January 2009. The city also has only 1,408 charging points in operation, of which, only 57% were used in the first quarter of 2014.[29] As of October?2015[update], Greater London postcode areas contain 8,000 electric vehicles according to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).[30]\\r\\nNissan's Sunderland plant  the largest car factory in the UK  was granted a GBS20.7 million grant from the British government and up to GBS220 million from the European Investment Bank.[31][32][33] Production of the Nissan Leaf at the Sunderland plant began in March 2013.[34] The plant has the capacity to produce 60,000 lithium-ion batteries and 50,000 Leafs a year.[31] The UK produced Leaf are sold only in Europe has an improved driving range, lower price and a more European design.[35] The price of the 2013 Leaf produced in Sunderland is lower than the model built in Japan,[36][37] and Nissan is offering a battery leasing option for the three trims produced at Sunderland, which further reduced the purchase price by GBS5,000.[38][39]\\r\\nAs of November?2013[update], the UK government had pledged GBS400 million to support the deployment of plug-in vehicles in the five years between March 2010 and March 2015. However, as of 30?September?2013[update], only GBS92 million had been spent and an additional of GBS44 million had been committed for projects up to March 2015, of which, GBS82 million were allocated for research and development; GBS16 million on infrastructure such as public charging points; and GBS25 million in consumer purchase incentives (Plug-in Car Grant). As of November?2013[update], the UK has around 5,000 public charging points, of which, only 200 are quick chargers.[8] By April 2014 the UK was the leader in quick charging deployment in Europe, with 211 CHAdeMO charging stations available across the country.[40]\\r\\nAs a result of lower than initially expected electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales, in January 2014 the UK government launched the \\"Go Ultra Low\\" national campaign in partnership with five of the largest manufacturers of plug-in electric vehicles, BMW, Nissan, Renault, Toyota and Vauxhall. The campaign has a cost of GBS2.5 million and its objective is to promote the benefits of electric and plug-in hybrid cars to buyers. The Government classifies any car emitting less than 75g/km of CO2 as ultra-low emission. The British government also announced its commitment to invest GBS9 million to install more rapid charge-points to make motorway journeys by electric car feasible. According to Nicholas Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, Our clear objective is to move the car fleet in this country to ultra low-emission vehicles by 2040 and to put money and policy money behind it.\\"[41]\\r\\nIn July 2014 Baroness Kramer, Minister of State for Transport, announced that all of the governments fleets will be supplied with funding to introduce electric vehicles. The \\"Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Readiness Project\\", funded with GBS5 million, is the first step towards making all government vehicles electrically powered. Central government fleets will benefit first, with plans to bring in over 150 plug-in cars and vans. The Government Car Service, which presently has 85 vehicles used by ministers, will be the initial target with electric cars expected to be in operation by the third quarter 2014. A second phase is scheduled next to provide funds for the public sector in general to purchase more electric vehicles. Beneficiary agencies includes the National Health Service, councils and police forces.[42]\\r\\nIn January 2009, transport secretary Geoff Hoon said the British government would make GBS250 million (~US$375 million) available for consumer incentives to bring electric cars to market in the UK.[28] The plug-in grant scheme was first announced in January 2009 by the Labour Government. The coalition government, led by David Cameron, took office in May 2010 and confirmed their support of the grant on 28 July 2010. This confirmed that GBS43 million would be available for the first 15 months of the scheme, with the 2011 Spending Review confirming funding for the programme for the lifetime of the Parliament of around GBS300 million (~US$450 million).[43][44][45]\\r\\nTwo subsidy programs were implemented, the Plug-in Car Grant, from January 2011, and the Plug-In Van Grant, from February 2012. Both offer buyers of eligible vehicles a purchase subsidy discounted at the point of purchase. As of December?2017[update], the number of eligible registered plug-in electric cars that have benefited with the subsidy totaled 127,509 units since the launch of the programme in 2011.[7] As of December?2016[update], the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 2,938 units since the launch of the programme in 2012.[23] As of December?2014[update], there were 1,467 electric cars and vans registered which were not eligible for the Plug-in Grant scheme.[46]\\r\\nThe Plug-in Car Grant programme started on 1 January 2011 and is available across the UK The programme reduces the up-front cost of eligible cars by providing a 25% grant towards the cost of new plug-in cars capped at GBS5,000 (US$7,450).[18][19] From 1 April 2015, the purchase price cap was raised to cover up to 35% discount of the vehicles recommended retail price, up to the already existing GBS5,000 limit. This change means electric cars priced under GBS20,000, such as the Renault Zoe, are able to take advantage of most or all of the S5,000 discount.[47] Both private and business fleet buyers are eligible for this grant which is received at the point of purchase.[18]\\r\\nThe subsidy programme is managed in a similar way to the grant made as part of the 2009 Car Scrappage Scheme, allowing consumers to buy an eligible car discounted at the point of purchase with the subsidy claimed back by the manufacturer afterwards.[18][19] The government announced in April 2014 that funding for the full grant of up to GBS5,000 will remain in place until either 50,000 grants have been issued or 2017, whichever is first.[47][48] Nevertheless, as forecasts estimated that the scheme would reached its 50,000 limit around November 2015, the government announced in August 2015 that the Plug-in Car Grant should continue until at least February 2016 for all plug-in cars with CO2 emissions of 75 g/km of under.[49] The Government also announced that a minimum of GBS200 million (~US$300 million) has been made available to continue the Plug-in Car Grant.[50]\\r\\nVehicles eligible for the subsidy must meet the following criteria:[18][51]\\r\\nIn February 2015 the government announced that to take account of rapidly developing technology, and the growing range of ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) on the British market, the criteria for the plug-in car grant was updated and from April 2015, eligible ULEVs must meet criteria in one of the following categories depending on emission levels and zero-emission-capable mileage, with a technology neutral approach, which means that hydrogen fuel cell cars are also eligible for the grant:[19][47]\\r\\nAs of October?2016[update], the following 31 cars available in the British market are eligible for the grant according to their category:[52]\\r\\nBMW i3, BYD e6, Citroen C-Zero, Ford Focus Electric, Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Kia Soul EV, Mahindra e2o, Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive, Nissan e-NV200 5- and 7-seater Combi, Nissan Leaf, Peugeot iOn, Renault Fluence Z.E., Renault Zoe, Smart Fortwo electric drive, Tesla Model S, Toyota Mirai, Volkswagen e-Golf, and Volkswagen e-Up!.\\r\\nAudi A3 e-tron (MY 2016 only), BMW 225xe, BMW 330e, Kia Optima PHEV, Mercedes-Benz C350 e, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (except GX3h 4Work), Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Vauxhall Ampera, Volkswagen Golf GTE, Volkswagen Passat GTE, Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid (D5 and D6 Twin Engine), and Volvo XC90 T8 Twin Engine Momentum.[52]\\r\\nCategory 2 or 3 vehicles with a recommended retail price over S60,000 arent eligible for a grant. This includes: BMW i8 (category 2), Mercedes-Benz S500 Plug-in Hybrid (category 3), and Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid (category 3).[52]\\r\\nThe Tesla Roadster was not included in the government's list of eligible vehicles for the plug-in electric car grant. Tesla Motors stated that the company applied for the scheme, but did not complete its application.[54]\\r\\nIn December 2015, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that Plug-in car grant was extended until the end of March 2018 to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy cleaner vehicles. A total funding of GBS400 million (~US$600 million) will be available for the extension. The criteria for the Plug-in Car Grant was updated and the maximum grant drops from GBS5,000 (~US$7,450) to GBS4,500 (~US$6,750). For the extension, the amount of the grant is linked in directly with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles three vehicle categories issued in April 2015. The eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of three categories depending on emission levels (CO2 emissions bands between 50 and 75g/km) and zero-emission-capable mileage with a minimum all-electric range of 10?mi (16?km). Hydrogen fuel cell cars are also eligible for the grant.[47][21][22] The updated scheme went into effect on 1 March 2016.[22]\\r\\nA price cap is in place, with all Category 1 plug-in vehicles eligible for the full grant no matter what their purchase price, while Category 2 and 3 models with a list price of more than GBS60,000 (~US$90,000) are no longer eligible for the grant. Vehicles with a zero-emission range of at least 70?mi (110?km) (category 1), including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, get a full GBS4,500 (~US$6,700), but plug-in hybrids (categories 2 and 3) costing under GBS60,000 (~US$90,000) receive GBS2,500 (~US$3,725).[21][22] Under the extended scheme, some plug-in hybrid sports car are no longer eligible for the grant, such as the BMW i8 because of its GBS100,000 (~US$150,000) purchase price tag.[53] The grant scheme will come under review when a cumulative total of 40,000 Category 1 claims, and 45,000 Category 2 and 3 combined sales have been made. Both these totals will include cars sold before March 2016.[22]\\r\\nIn addition to the extension of the Plug-in Grant, the government also announced it will continue the \\"Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme.\\" Starting in March 2016 owners of ultra-low emission vehicles who install a dedicated charge point at their home, covering roughly half the average cost, get GBS500 (~US$750) towards the cost of installing the charging point, rather than the previous GBS700 (~US$1,050) maximum.[21][22]\\r\\nThe Plug-In Car Grant was extended to include vans since February 2012. Van buyers can receive 20% - up to GBS8,000 (~ US$12,000) - off the cost of a plug-in van. To be eligible for the scheme, vans have to meet performance criteria to ensure safety, range, and ultra-low tailpipe emissions.[20] Consumers, both business and private can receive the discount at the point of purchase.[20] The Plug-In Van Grant scheme was extended in October 2016 to make electric trucks above 3.5 tonnes eligible for grants of up to GBS20,000, when businesses switch their large trucks to an electric vehicle.[24] Also in October 2016, the government announced their commitment for an additional GBS4 million to the scheme so that all vans and trucks meeting the eligibility requirements can benefit from the grant scheme.[24] The extension of the Plug-In Van grant means that N2 vans (3.5 ÿ 12 tonnes gross weight) and N3 vans (over 12 tonnes gross weight) are now eligible.[24]\\r\\nThe eligibility criteria for vans with a gross weight of 3.5 tonnes or less (N1 van) are:[20]\\r\\nor extra evidence of battery performance to show reasonable performance after 3 years of use\\r\\nAs of December?2016[update], the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 2,938 units since the launch of the programme in 2012, up from 1,906 made by the end of December 2015.[23] As of October?2016[update] the following nine vans are eligible for the grant: BD Otomotive eTraffic, BD Otomotiv eDucato, Citro?n Berlingo, Mercedes-Benz Vito E-Cell, Mitsubishi Outlander GX3h 4Work, Nissan e-NV200, Peugeot ePartner, Renault Kangoo Z.E., and Smith Electric Edison.[52]\\r\\nOn 19 November 2009, Andrew Adonis, the Secretary of State for Transport, announced a scheme called \\"Plugged-in-Places\\", making available S30 million to be shared between three and six cities to investigate further the viability of providing power supply for electric vehicles, and encouraging local government and business to participate and bid for funds.[55]\\r\\nThe Government is supporting the Plugged-In Places programme to install vehicle recharging points across the UK. The scheme offers match-funding to consortia of businesses and public sector partners to support the installation of electric vehicle recharging infrastructure in lead places across the UK.[56] There are eight Plugged-In Places: East of England;[57] Greater Manchester; London;[58] Midlands;[59] Milton Keynes;[60] North East;[61] Northern Ireland;[62] and Scotland. The Government also published an Infrastructure Strategy in June 2011.[63]\\r\\nAll-electric vehicles (BEVs) and eligible plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) qualify for a 100% discount from the London congestion charge. A plug-in electric drive vehicle qualifies if the vehicle is registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and has a fuel type of 'electric', or alternatively, if the vehicle is a 'plug-in hybrid' and is on the Government's list of PHEVs eligible for the OLEV grant.[64] As of February?2016[update], approved PHEVs include all extended-range cars such as the BMW i3 REx, and plug-in hybrids that emit 75g/km or less of CO2 and that meet the Euro 5 standard for air quality, such as the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, BMW i8, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (passenger and van variants), Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, and Volkswagen Golf GTE.[65]\\r\\nThe original Greener Vehicle Discount was substituted by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) scheme that went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. As of July?2013[update] there are no internal combustion-only vehicles that meet this criteria. The measure is designed to limit the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads. Mayor Boris Johnson approved the new scheme in April 2013, after taking into account a number of comments received during the 12-week public consultation that took place. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period (until 24 June 2016) before they have to pay the full congestion charge.[66][67][68][69]\\r\\nField testing with 100 Smart EDs began in London in 2007.[70][71] On 30 April 2009, the Electric Car Corporation put on sale the Citro?n C1 ev'ie, an adapted Citro?n C1 intended for city driving. On that date, it had a list price of S16,850 ($24,989 US).[72][73][74][75]\\r\\nA demonstration trial with the Mini E took place between December 2009 and March 2011 with 40 Mini E cars leased to private users for a two consecutive six-month field trial periods.[76] In addition, one Mini E was delivered to the Government car pool in Downing Street to be tested by ministers in an urban environment on their official business around London.[77] The UK trial was a partnership between BMW Group UK, Scottish and Southern Energy, the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire County Council. Data collection and research was conducted by Oxford Brookes Universitys Sustainable Vehicle Engineering Centre throughout the UK project. Funding support was provided by the Technology Strategy Board and the Department for Transport (DFT) as part of the GBS25 million (US$41 million) UK-wide program involving trials of 340 ultra-low carbon vehicles from several carmakers.[76][77][78] The selected test area is roughly a triangle contained within the M40 motorway between the M25 motorway and Oxford, the A34 south to the M3 motorway, and the M3 back to the M25.[79]\\r\\nThe 40 Mini E electric cars were kept in use after the trial was completed in March 2011, participating in activities to promote awareness and understanding of electric vehicles. These cars were part of the BMW Group UKs official vehicle fleet of 4,000 low-emission luxury vehicles deployed for the London 2012 Olympic Games. The fleet also included 160 BMW ActiveE electric cars.[76][80]\\r\\nAs of 10?January?2017[update], the UK had 11,837 public charging points at 4,237 locations, of which 2,173 were rapid charging points at 695 locations.[25] According to UK's National Chargepoint Registry, there are over 25 network operators (chargepoint owners, branded networks and chargepoint controllers) at a national and regional basis.[81] As of October?2016[update], the regions with most of the infrastructure are London (16%), South East (15.6%), Scotland (15.1%), South West (9.1%), and North East (8.7%).[25]\\r\\nThe UK also has nine regional operators:[82] Source London, Source East, Source West, ChargePlace Scotland, Energise (for the South-East), Plugged-In Midlands, Greater Manchester EV, ChargerNet (for Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole) and eCar (for Northern Ireland).\\r\\nMany companies, local and regional authorise also provide charging to employees and members of the public. Purchasers of electric vehicles also receive a S900 subsidy for installation of a charger at their home (which covers nearly all purchase and installation costs).[83]\\r\\nMore than 137,000 light-duty plug-in electric vehicles have been registered in the UK up until December 2017, including about 5,100 plug-in commercial vans.[9] These figures includes a significant number of registered plug-in electric cars and vans which were not eligible for the grant schemes.[9] Before the market launch of highway-capable mass production plug-in electric cars in 2010, a total of 1,096 electric vehicles were registered in the country between 2006 and December 2010.[84] As of December?2016[update], the UK had the fourth largest European stock of light-duty plug-in vehicles after Norway, the Netherlands and France,[10] and with 36,907 plug-in passenger cars registered in 2016, ranked as the second best selling European plug-in market after Norway.[11]\\r\\nElectric car sales grew from 138 units in 2010 to 1,082 units during 2011.[1][85] Before 2011, the G-Wiz quadricycle as top selling EV for several years.[86] During 2012, a total of 2,254 plug-in electric cars were registered in the UK, of which, 1,262 were pure electrics, and sales were led by the Nissan Leaf with 699 units, followed by the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid with 470 units, and the Vauxhall Ampera with 455 units sold in 2012.[2][87][88][89] In addition, 279 Renault Kangoo Z.E. electric vans and 252 Renault Twizy electric quadricycles were sold through September 2012.[90] Vehicles eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant accounted for 0.1% of total new car sales in 2012, with pure electric cars representing only 0.06%.[91]\\r\\nDuring 2013, a total of 3,586 plug-in electric cars were registered, up 59.0% from 2012.[3][92] Of these, 2,512 were pure electric cars, up 99.0% from 2012, and 1,072 plug-in hybrids, up 8.1% from 2012.[3] Plug-in car sales represented a 0.16% market share of the 2.26 million new cars sold in the UK in 2013.[92] The top selling plug-in electric car during 2013 was the Nissan Leaf, with 1,812 units sold,[93] and the Prius PHV ended 2013 as the top selling plug-in hybrid with 509 units sold, up 8.5% from 2012.[92]\\r\\nThe British market experienced a rapid growth of plug-in car sales during 2014, driven by the introduction of new models such as the BMW i3, Tesla Model S, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, Renault Zoe, and Volkswagen e-Up!.[94][46][95] The number of plug-in cars available in the market climbed from 9 models in 2011 to 18 in 2013, and to 29 models by the end of 2014.[46] Registrations during 2014 totaled 14,518 plug-in electric cars and consisted of 6,697 pure electrics and 7,821 plug-in hybrids. Total registrations in 2014 were up 305% from 2013, with all-electric cars growing 167% while plug-in hybrid registrations were up 628% from a year earlier.[4] The plug-in electric car segment captured a 0.59% market share of new car sales in 2014, over three times and a half the market share of 2013 (0.16%).[4][93] In November 2014, with 646 all-electric cars and 1,225 plug-in hybrids registered, the segment's market share passed 1% of monthly new car sales for the first time in the UK.[96][97] Again in January 2015, the segment's market share was over 1% of new car sales with 1,715 plug-in electric cars registered that month.[98][99]\\r\\nNissan Leaf sales in September 2014 achieved a record of 851 units, up from 332 units the same month in 2013, representing not only the best monthly sales ever in the UK, but also the largest volume of Nissan Leafs ever sold in one month in a European country. The previous European record was achieved by Norway in March 2013 with 703 Leafs sold in that month.[94][101] Sales of recently introduced BMW i3 and i8 models exceeded 1,600 units during 2014.[102] The Outlander P-HEV was among the new models with a significant effect in the market, released in April 2014, it captured a 35.8% market share of total plug-in sales during the first half of 2014.[103] The Mitsubishi plug-in hybrid became the top selling plug-in electric vehicle in July 2014 and captured 43% of all applications to the Plug-in Car Grants scheme that month.[104]\\r\\nThe Outlander P-HEV ended 2014 as the top selling plug-in electric car in the UK that year with 5,370 units sold.[105][106] Sales of the Nissan Leaf also experienced significant growth in 2014, with 4,051 units sold, up 124% from the 1,812 units sold in 2013, and ranked as the top selling all-electric car in 2014.[95] As of December?2014[update], the Leaf continued ranking as the top selling plug-in electric car in the UK ever with cumulative sales of 7,197 units since its introduction in March 2011.[93][88][95] Over 24,500 light-duty plug-in electric cars were registered in the country at the end of December 2014.[46]\\r\\nThe surge in demand for plug-in cars continued during 2015, to the extent that 2014's ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) sales figure was passed in June 2015.[49] Plug-in electric car registrations in the UK totaled 28,188 units in 2015, consisting of 9,934 pure electric cars and 18,254 plug-in hybrids. Total registrations in 2015 were up 94.0% from 2014, with all-electric cars growing 48.3% year-on-year, while plug-in hybrid registrations were up 133.0% year-on-year.[5] Since 2011, about 54,000 plug-in electric vehicles have been registered in the UK up until December 2015, including plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars, and about 2,900 commercial vans. This figure includes a significant number of registered plug-in electric cars and vans which were not eligible for the grant schemes.[107]\\r\\nThe plug-in electric car segment raised its market share of new car sales in 2015 to almost 1.1%, up from 0.59% in 2014.[4][107] With almost 3,100 plug-in cars sold during December 2015, the plug-in segment reached a record of 1.7% of new car sales in the UK, the highest ever.[107] According to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), the market share of all new leased cars reached 4% in 2015, while a record 4.7% of all new leased cars registered during the last quarter of 2015 was a plug-in.[109]\\r\\nSales of the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV in the British market reached the 10,000 unit milestone in March 2015, allowing the plug-in hybrid to overtake the Leaf as the all-time top selling plug-in electric vehicle in the UK.[110][111] Sales of the Nissan Leaf sales passed the 10,000 unit milestone in June 2015.[112] The top selling models in 2015 were the Outlander P-HEV with 11,681 units registered, up 118% from 2014, followed by the Leaf with 5,236 units (up 29%), and the BMW i3 with 2,213 units (up 59%).[113]\\r\\nAs of December?2015[update], cumulative sales of the Outlander P-HEV, the top selling plug-in car in the UK ever, totaled 17,045 units registered,[113] and cumulative sales of the Nissan Leaf, the top selling all-electric car ever, totaled 12,433 units registered.[93][113][88][95] Combined sales of the Outlander PHEV and the Nissan Leaf represent more than 50% of the British stock of plug-in electric cars sold since 2011.[114]\\r\\nPlug-in car sales in March 2016 achieved the best monthly plug-in sales volume on record ever, with 7,144 grant eligible cars registered, exceeding the previous high of 6,104 units, recorded in March 2015.[115][116] The plug-in market share during this month reached 1.37% of total UK new car registrations, continuing the trend for the fifth month running of sales equal of or exceeding the 1.3% market share threshold.[116] The surge in March sales was expected as a result of the changes in the Plug-in Car Grant scheme, which now provides a stronger incentive for pure electrics over plug-in hybrids, as the grant amount available for purchase of both types of powertrain was reduced, but the grant for plug-in hybrids was cut by half.[116]\\r\\nDuring the first quarter of 2016 Outlander P-HEV sales totaled 3,906 units, representing 52.3% of all plug-in hybrid registered in the UK during the quarter.[117] By early April 2016, two years since launch, there were 21,053 Outlander P-HEVs in the UK's roads, and the plug-in SUV sales represent 36.2% of the 58,186 eligible cars registered since the grant scheme was introduced in January 2011.[117][118] The sustained demand for plug-in cars over the previous 12 months through March 2016, has allowed the UK to become a leading market in the European Union for electric vehicles, ranking as the second biggest market after the Netherlands in terms of total plug-in car registrations, with 28,715 new units representing 20% of the European Unions collective plug-in sales.[115]\\r\\nRegistrations during the first six months of 2016 recorded the highest-volume half-year ever for plug-in electric car registrations.[119] A total of 19,252 plug-in electric cars were registered in the UK between January and June 2016.[120] During the first half of 2016, the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV was the top selling plug-in car in the UK with 5,738 units registered. The Nissan Leaf remained the top selling pure-electric car with 2,336 registrations.[119]\\r\\nA total of 36,907 plug-in electric vehicles were registered in 2016, of which, 35,447 cars were eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant. Registrations consisted of 10,264 all-electric cars, up 3.3% from 2015, and 26,643 plug-in hybrids, up 41.9% from the previous year.[6] Sales of plug-in hybrids oversold pure electric cars, with the latter more than doubling sales of battery electric models.[6][121] The plug-in car segment's market share reached 1.37% of new car sales in 2016.[6] While overall new car registrations year-to-date increased 2.3% from the same period in 2015, total plug-in car registrations in 2016 increased 28.6% from a year earlier.[6] The Outlander P-HEV continued to lead sales of the plug-in electric segment in 2016 with 9,486 units delivered. The Leaf remained as the top selling all-electric car with 4,463 units registered. The other best selling models were the Mercedes-Benz C 350 e (4,934), BMW 330e (3,499), and the BMW i3 (2,450).[122]\\r\\nBy mid-October 2016, sales of the Outlander P-HEV passed the 25,000 unit mark, accounting for about 50% of all plug-in hybrid sold in the UK since 2010.[15] As of December?2016[update], the Outlander plug-in hybrid continued ranking as the all-time top selling plug-in electric car in the UK, with 26,600 units sold since its inception.[14] Cumulative sales of the Nissan Leaf, the second all-time best selling plug-in car and top selling all-electric car ever, passed the 15,000 unit mark in September 2016.[16] Ranking third is the BMW i3, with almost 6,000 units sold since its inception in late 2013 through October 2016.[108]\\r\\nRegistration of plug-in cars totaled 8,087 units in March 2017, surpassing the previous sales record achieved in March 2016 (7,534).[12][13] In addition to the normal annual sales peak caused by the plate change, consumers rushed to complete purchases to avoid the new vehicle excise duty (VED) rates that came into force from 1 April for petrol-powered vehicles priced more than GBS40,000, including all plug-in hybrid models.[13] The plug-in electric car segment reached a market share of 1.44% of new car sales in March 2017.[12] Registrations during the first quarter of 2017 totaled 12,071 plug-in cars, consisting of 4,634 all-electric cars and 7,437 plug-in hybrids, achieving a record market share of 1.47% for that quarter.[12]\\r\\nThe following table presents annual registrations of plug-in electric cars and vans by model between 2010 and 2013, and total registrations (cumulative) by model at the end of December 2014, and at the end of June 2016.\\r\\nA study by Element Energy commissioned by BP and published in September 2013, concluded that the use of advanced biofuels in the UK, and particularly E20 cellulosic ethanol, is a more cost-effective way of reducing emissions than using plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the timeframe to 2030. The study also found that the use of higher blends of biofuels is complementary to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) can deliver strong CO2 savings with a decarbonised electric grid, but are expected to have significantly higher costs than internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid cars to 2030, as the latter are expected to be the most popular models by 2030. According to the study, blending biofuels in fuels is a cheaper way to reduce emissions than using BEVs in the timeframe to 2030, as an E20 blend in a HEV can achieve a 10% emission savings compared to an HEV running on E5, for an annual fuel cost premium of GBS13 compared to an annual cost of GBS195 for an all-electric car. The study also concluded that advanced biofuels address emissions of both new and existing vehicles, thus reducing emissions earlier than new powertrains and abating the risk of relying solely on longer term deployment of new technology.[128][129]","input":"How many electric cars are there in the uk?"},{"output":"Nevada","context":"The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository, as designated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 1987, is to be a deep geological repository storage facility within Yucca Mountain for spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive waste in the United States. The site is located on federal land adjacent to the Nevada Test Site in Nye County, Nevada, about 80?mi (130?km) northwest of the Las Vegas Valley.\\r\\nThe project was approved in 2002 by the United States Congress, but Federal funding for the site ended in 2011 under the Obama Administration via amendment to the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, passed on April 14, 2011.[2][not in citation given] The project has had many difficulties and was highly contested by the non-local public, the Western Shoshone peoples, and many politicians.[3] The Government Accountability Office stated that the closure was for political, not technical or safety reasons.[2]\\r\\nThis leaves the US government and utilities without any designated long-term storage site for the high-level radioactive waste stored on-site at various nuclear facilities around the country. The US government disposes of transuranic waste at WIPP in New Mexico, in rooms 2,150 feet (660?m) underground.[4]\\r\\nUnder President Obama the Department of Energy (DOE) was reviewing options other than Yucca Mountain for a high-level waste repository and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by the Secretary of Energy, released its final report in January 2012. It expressed urgency to find a consolidated, geological repository, and said that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with direct access to the Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as is the cabinet department of the Department of Energy.[5] In the meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.[6]\\r\\nUnder President Trump the DOE has ceased deep borehole [7] and other non-Yucca Mountain waste disposition research activities. For FY18 DOE has requested $120 million and the NRC $30 million [8] from Congress to continue licensing activities for the Yucca Mountain Repository.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpent nuclear fuel is the radioactive by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and high-level radioactive waste is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.[9] In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy to solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act,[10] which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.[11][page?needed]\\r\\nThe DOE began studying Yucca Mountain in 1978 to determine whether it would be suitable for the nation's first long-term geologic repository for over 70,000 metric tons (69,000 long tons; 77,000 short tons) (150 million pounds)[12] of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste as of 2015[when?] stored at 121 sites around the nation. An estimated 10,000 metric tons (9,800 long tons; 11,000 short tons) of the waste would be from America's military nuclear programs.[13] On December 19, 1984, the DOE selected ten locations in six states for consideration as potential repository sites, based on data collected for nearly ten years. The ten sites were studied and results of these preliminary studies were reported in 1985. Based on these reports, President Ronald Reagan approved three sites for intensive scientific study called site characterization. The three sites were Hanford, Washington; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain. In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed DOE to study only Yucca Mountain, which is located within a former nuclear test site. The Act provided that if during site characterization the Yucca Mountain location was found unsuitable, studies would be stopped immediately. This option expired when the site was actually recommended by the President. On July 23, 2002, President George W. Bush signed House Joint Resolution 87,[14] (Pub.L. 107ÿ200) allowing the DOE to take the next step in establishing a safe repository in which to store the country's nuclear waste. The DOE was to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain Repository by January 31, 1998 but did not do so because of a series of delays due to legal challenges, concerns over how to transport nuclear waste to the facility, and political pressures resulting in underfunding of the construction.\\r\\nOn July 18, 2006 the DOE proposed March 31, 2017 as the date to open the facility and begin accepting waste based on full funding. On September 8, 2006 Ward (Edward) Sproat, a nuclear industry executive formerly of PECO energy in Pennsylvania, was nominated by President Bush to lead the Yucca Mountain Project. Following the 2006 mid-term Congressional elections, Democratic Nevada Senator Harry Reid, a longtime opponent of the repository, became the Senate Majority Leader, putting him in a position to greatly affect the future of the project. Reid has said that he would continue to work to block completion of the project, and is quoted as having said: \\"Yucca Mountain is dead. It'll never happen.\\"[15]\\r\\nIn the 2008 Omnibus Spending Bill, the Yucca Mountain Project's budget was reduced to $390 million. The project was able to reallocate resources and delay transportation expenditures to complete the License Application for submission on June 3, 2008. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama promised to abandon the Yucca Mountain project.[16] As a result, Senator Reid moved the Nevada primary to help Obama's campaign.[citation needed] After his election, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Obama he did not have the ability to do so.[17] On April 23, 2009, Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and eight other senators introduced legislation to provide \\"rebates\\" from a $30 billion federally managed fund into which nuclear power plants had been paying, so as to refund all collected funds if the project was in fact cancelled by Congress.[18]\\r\\nIn November 2013, in response to a lawsuit filed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute, the US court of appeals ruled that nuclear utilities may stop paying into the nuclear waste recovery fund until either the DOE follows the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which designates Yucca Mountain as the repository, or Congress changes the law.[19] The fee ended May 16, 2014.\\r\\nLacking an operating repository, the federal government initially paid utility companies somewhere between $300 and $500 million per year in compensation for failing to comply with the contract it signed to take the spent nuclear fuel by 1998.[20] [needs update] For the ten years after 2015 it is estimated to cost taxpayers $24 billion in payments from the Judgment Fund. [21] The Judgment Fund is not subject to budget rules and allows Congress to ignore the nuclear waste issue since payments therefrom do not have any impact on yearly spending for other programs.\\r\\nThe purpose of the Yucca Mountain project is to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and develop a national site for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste storage. The management and operating contractor as of April 1, 2009 for the project is USA Repository Services, a consortium of government contractors, URS Corporation (now part of AECOM), Shaw Corporation (now part of CB&I) and Areva Federal Services LLC. After the layoff of 800 employees on March 31, 2009, about 100 employees remained on the project until all technical staff were laid off by the end of FY 2010[22] due to zero funding in the 2011 budget for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.[23] Sandia National Laboratories had the responsibility for post closure analysis and ensuring compliance with the NWPA. The main tunnel of the Exploratory Studies Facility is U-shaped, 5?mi (8.0?km) long and 25?ft (7.6?m) wide. There are also several cathedral-like alcoves that branch from the main tunnel. It is in these alcoves that most of the scientific experiments were conducted. The emplacement drifts (smaller diameter tunnels branching off the main tunnel) where waste would have been stored were not constructed since they required a construction authorization by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.[24] The repository has a statutory limit of 77,000 metric tons (85,000 short tons).[25] To store this amount of waste would have required 40 miles (64?km) of tunnels.[1] The Nuclear Waste Policy Act further limits the capacity of the repository to 63,000 metric tons (62,000 long tons; 69,000 short tons) of initial heavy metal in commercial spent fuel. The 104 U.S. commercial reactors currently operating will produce this quantity of spent fuel by 2014,[26] assuming that the spent fuel rods are not reprocessed. Currently, the US has no civil reprocessing plant.\\r\\nBy 2008, Yucca Mountain was one of the most studied pieces of geology in the world;[27] between geologic studies and materials science[28] the United States had invested US$9 billion on the project.[29] This site studied by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology (NBMG) differs substantially from other potential repositories due to the finding of natural analogues of nuclear material that are currently being studied.[30] The DOE estimates that it has over 100 million U.S. gallons of highly radioactive waste and 2,500 metric tons (2,800 short tons) of spent fuel from the production of nuclear weapons and from research activities in temporary storage.[31] The cost of the facility is being paid for by a combination of a tax on each kilowatt hour of nuclear power and by the taxpayers for disposal of weapons and naval nuclear waste. Based on the 2001 cost estimate, approximately 73 percent is funded from consumers of nuclear-powered electricity and 27 percent by the taxpayers.[32] The Total System Life Cycle Cost presented to Congress on July 15, 2008 by Director Sproat was $90 billion. This cost, could not be compared to previous estimates since it included a repository capacity about twice as large as previously estimated over a much longer period of time (100 years vs 30 years). Additionally, the cost of the project continued to escalate because of insufficient funding to most efficiently move forward and complete the project. By 2007, the DOE announced it was seeking to double the size of the Yucca Mountain repository to a capacity of 135,000 metric tons (149,000 short tons), or 300 million pounds.[33]\\r\\nThe tunnel boring machine (TBM) that excavated the main tunnel cost $13?million and was 400?ft (120?m) in length when in operation. It now sits at its exit point at the South Portal (south entrance) of the facility. The short side tunnel alcoves were excavated using explosives.[34]\\r\\nThe DOE was scheduled to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain repository by January 31, 1998. As of 2010[update], years after this deadline, the future status of the repository at Yucca Mountain was still unknown due to on-going litigation, and opposition by Senator Harry Reid.[35]\\r\\nBecause of construction delays, a number of nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to dry cask storage of waste on-site indefinitely in steel and concrete casks.[6]\\r\\nThe project is widely opposed in Nevada and is a hotly debated national topic. A two-thirds majority of Nevadans feel it is unfair for their state to have to store nuclear waste when there are no nuclear power plants in Nevada[36] Many Nevadans' opposition stemmed from the so-called \\"Screw Nevada Bill,\\" the 1987 legislation halting study of Hanford and Texas as potential sites for the waste before conclusions could be made.[36] The local county in which the proposed facility is located, Nye County, supports the development of the repository as do six adjoining counties.[37]\\r\\nOne point of concern has been the standard of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350?millirem per year for that period.[38] In October 2007, the DOE issued a draft of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows that for the first 10,000?years mean public dose would be 0.24?mrem/year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98?mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem.[39] Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get more than twice that.[40][41][42]\\r\\nOn February 12, 2002, U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham made the decision that this site was suitable to be the nation's nuclear repository.[43] The governor of Nevada had 90?days to object and did so. However, the United States Congress overrode the objection. If the governor's objection had stood the project would have been abandoned and a new site chosen. In August 2004, the repository became an election issue, when Senator John Kerry (D) said that he would abandon the plans if elected.\\r\\nIn March 2005, the Energy and Interior departments revealed that several U.S. Geological Survey hydrologists had exchanged e-mails discussing possible falsification of quality assurance documents on water infiltration research.[44][not in citation given] On February 17, 2006, the DOEs Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) released a report confirming the technical soundness of infiltration modeling work performed by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) employees.[44] In March 2006, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Majority Staff issued a 25-page white paper \\"Yucca Mountain: The Most Studied Real Estate on the Planet.\\" The conclusions were:[44]\\r\\nOn January 18, 2006, DOE OCRWM announced that it would designate Sandia National Laboratories as its lead laboratory to integrate repository science work for the Yucca Mountain Project. \\"We believe that establishing Sandia as our lead laboratory is an important step in our new path forward. The independent, expert review that the scientists at Sandia will perform will help ensure that the technical and scientific basis for the Yucca Mountain repository is without question,\\" OCRWMs Acting Director Paul Golan said. \\"Sandia has unique experience in managing scientific investigations in support of a federally licensed geologic disposal facility, having served in that role as the scientific advisor to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico.\\"[45] Sandia began acting as the lead laboratory on October 1, 2006.\\r\\nBecause of questions raised by the State of Nevada[46] and Congressional members about the quality of the science behind Yucca Mountain, the DOE announced on March 31, 2006 the selection of Oak Ridge Associated Universities/Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (a not-for-profit consortium that includes 96 doctoral degree-granting institutions and 11 associate member universities) to provide expert reviews of scientific and technical work on the Yucca Mountain Project.[47] DOE stated that the Yucca Mountain Project \\"will be based on sound science. By bringing in Oak Ridge for review of technical work, DOE will seek to present a high level of expertise and credibility as they move the project forward... This award gives DOE access to academic and research institutions to help DOE meet their mission and legal obligation to license, construct, and open Yucca Mountain as the nations repository for spent nuclear fuel.\\"[48]\\r\\nThere was significant public and political opposition to the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository project in Nevada. An attempt was made to push ahead with the project and override this opposition. But for large projects which would take decades to complete, there is every chance that sustained local opposition will prevail, and this happened with the Yucca Mountain project.[49] Successful nuclear waste storage siting efforts in Scandinavia have involved local communities in the decision-making process and given them a veto at each stage, but this did not happen with Yucca Mountain. Local communities at potential storage and repository sites \\"should have early and continued involvement in the process, including funding that would allow them to retain technical experts\\".[49]\\r\\nOn March 5, 2009, Energy Secretary Steven Chu reiterated in a Senate hearing that the Yucca Mountain site was no longer considered an option for storing reactor waste.[50]\\r\\nOn March 3, 2010, the DOE filed a motion with the NRC to withdraw its license application,[51] however multiple lawsuits to stop this action have been filed by states, counties, and individuals across the country as being unauthorized by the NWPA.[52][53]\\r\\nThe costly nuclear accident in 2014 at New Mexico's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in which a nuclear waste container exploded, has caused doubt that it could serve as an alternative for Yucca.[54][55]\\r\\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established its Yucca Mountain standards in June 2001.[56] The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem per year for the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards set a limit of 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.[57]\\r\\nShortly after the EPA first established these standards in 2001, the nuclear industry, several environmental and public interest groups, and the State of Nevada challenged the standards in court. In July 2004, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found in favor of the Agency on all counts except one: the 10,000 year regulatory time frame. The court ruled that EPAs 10,000-year compliance period for isolation of radioactive waste was not consistent with National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommendations and was too short.[58][59] The NAS report had recommended standards be set for the time of peak risk, which might approach a period of one million years.[60] By limiting the compliance time to 10,000 years, EPA did not respect a statutory requirement that it develop standards consistent with NAS recommendations.[61]\\r\\nEPA published in the Federal Register a final rule in 2009. The new rule limits radiation doses from Yucca Mountain for up to 1,000,000 years after it closes. Within that regulatory time frame, the EPA has two dose standards that would apply based on the number of years from the time the facility is closed.\\r\\nFor the first 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rules dose limit of 15?millirem per year. This is protection at the level of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100?millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1?mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.[62]\\r\\nThe formation that makes up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi-welded tuff. The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation.[63] It lies along the transition between the Mojave and the Great Basin Deserts.[64]\\r\\nThe volcanic tuff at Yucca Mountain is appreciably fractured and movement of water through an aquifer below the waste repository is primarily through fractures.[65] While the fractures are usually confined to individual layers of tuff, the faults extend from the planned storage area all the way to the water table 600 to 1,500?ft (180 to 460?m) below the surface.[66] Future water transport from the surface to waste containers is likely to be dominated by fractures. There is evidence that surface water has been transported down through the 700?ft (210?m) of overburden to the exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain in less than 50 years.[67][68]\\r\\nSome site opponents assert that, after the predicted containment failure of the waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface.[69] Officials state that the waste containers will be stored in such a way as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.\\r\\nThe area around Yucca Mountain received much more rain in the geologic past and the water table was consequently much higher than it is today, though well below the level of the repository.\\r\\nNevada ranks fourth in the nation for current seismic activity.[70] Earthquake databases (the Council of the National Seismic System Composite Catalogue and the Southern Great Basin Seismic Network) provide current and historical earthquake information. Analysis of the available data in 1996 indicates that, since 1976, there have been 621 seismic events of magnitude greater than 2.5 within a 50-mile (80?km) radius of Yucca Mountain.[70]\\r\\nDOE has stated that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not significantly affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.[71]\\r\\nIn September 2007, it was discovered that the Bow Ridge fault line ran underneath the facility, hundreds of feet east of where it was originally thought to be located, beneath a storage pad where spent radioactive fuel canisters would be cooled before being sealed in a maze of tunnels. The discovery required several structures to be moved several hundred feet further to the east, and drew criticism from Robert R. Loux, then head of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, who argues that Yucca administrators should have known about the fault line's location years prior, and called the movement of the structures just-in-time engineering.[72][73] In June 2008, a major nuclear equipment supplier, Holtec International, criticized the Department of Energy's safety plan for handling containers of radioactive waste before they are buried at the proposed Yucca Mountain dump. The concern is that, in an earthquake, the unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial at Yucca Mountain could be sent into a \\"chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts\\".[74]\\r\\nThe nuclear waste was planned to be shipped to the site by rail and/or truck in robust containers known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada would have been public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport would have been secret for security reasons. State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel entered their jurisdictions.[75]\\r\\nWithin Nevada, the planned primary mode of transportation was via rail through the Caliente Corridor. This corridor starts in Caliente, Nevada, traveling along the northern and western borders of the Nevada Test Site for approximately 200 miles (320?km). At this point, it turns south.[76]\\r\\nOther options that were being considered included a rail route along the Mina corridor. This rail route would have originated at the Fort Churchill Siding rail line, near Wabuska. The proposed corridor would have proceeded southeast through Hawthorne, Blair Junction, Lida Junction and Oasis Valley. At Oasis Valley, the rail line would have turned north-northeast towards Yucca Mountain. Use of this rail corridor by the Department of Energy would have required permission from the Walker River Paiute Tribe in order to cross their land. As the first 54 miles (87?km) of the proposed corridor was owned by the Department of Defense, additional permission from the DoD would have to have been granted.[77]\\r\\nSince the early 1960s, the U.S. has safely conducted more than 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel without any harmful release of radioactive material. This safety record is comparable to the worldwide experience where more than 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been transported since 1970 ÿ an amount approximately equal to the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that would have been shipped to Yucca Mountain.[75] However, cities were still concerned about the transport of radioactive waste on highways and railroads that may have passed through heavily populated areas. Dr. Robert Halstead, who was a transportation adviser to the state of Nevada since 1988, stated regarding transportation of the high level waste, \\"They would heavily affect cities like Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, in the Chicago metropolitan area, in Omaha.\\" \\"Coming out of the south, the heaviest impacts would be in Atlanta, in Nashville, St. Louis, Kansas City, moving across through Salt Lake City, through downtown Las Vegas, up to Yucca Mountain. And the same cities would be affected by rail shipments as well.\\" Spencer Abraham (DOE) on the other hand has stated, \\"I think there's a general understanding that we move hazardous materials in this country, an understanding that the federal government knows how to do it safely.\\"[78]\\r\\nArchaeological surveys have found evidence that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis.[79] Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.[80]\\r\\nYucca Mountain and surrounding lands were central in the lives of the Southern Paiute, Western Shoshone, and Owens Valley Paiute and Shoshone peoples, who shared them for religious ceremonies, resource uses, and social events.[81][82]\\r\\nIn Tom Clancy's book \\"Dead or Alive\\", middle eastern terrorists attempt to detonate a nuclear bomb inside the facility to contaminate groundwater on the west coast (this is as if construction had been completed on the repository and the facility put to use)\\r\\nStarting in 2009, the Obama administration attempted to close the Yucca Mountain repository, despite current US law that designates Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository. The administration agency, DOE, began implementation of the President's plan in May 2009. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also went along with the administration's closure plan. Various state and Congressional entities attempted to challenge the administration's closure plans, by statute and in court. Most recently, in August 2013, a US Court of Appeals decision told the NRC and the Obama administration that they must either \\"approve or reject the Energy Department's application for [the] never-completed waste storage site at Nevada's Yucca Mountain.\\" They cannot simply make plans for its closure in violation of US law.[83]\\r\\nIn May 2009, then United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu stated:\\r\\n\\"Yucca Mountain as a repository is off the table. What we're going to be doing is saying, let's step back. We realize that we know a lot more today than we did 25 or 30 years ago. The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades, so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long-term strategy. We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...\\r\\n\\"Some of the waste is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no economical reason why you would ever think of pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagineagain, it depends on what the blue-ribbon panel saysone could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymorethat's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.\\r\\nIn 2008, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works found that failure to perform to contractual requirements could cost taxpayers up to $11 billion by 2020.[85] In 2013 this estimate of taxpayer liability was raised to $21 billion.[86] In July 2009, the House of Representatives voted 388 to 30 on amendments to HHR3183 (Roll call vote 591, via Clerk.House.gov) to not defund the Yucca Mountain repository in the FY2010 budget.[35][87] In 2013, the House of Representatives voted twice during the 2014 Energy and Water Appropriations debate by over 80% majority to reject elimination of Yucca Mountain as the nation's only nuclear waste solution.[88]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2010, the state of Washington filed suit to prevent the closing of Yucca Mountain, since this would slow efforts to clean up Hanford Nuclear Reservation.[89] South Carolina, Aiken County (the location of Savannah River site) and others joined Washington.[90] The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit in July 2011, saying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not ruled on the withdrawal of the license application.[91] Washington and South Carolina filed another lawsuit on July 29.[92]\\r\\nWith $32 billion received from power companies to fund the project, and $12 billion spent to study and build it, the federal government had $27 billion left, including interest. In March 2012, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a bill requiring three-fourths of that money to be given back to customers, and the remainder to the companies for storage improvements.[93]\\r\\nIn August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to either \\"approve or reject the Energy Department's application for [the] never-completed waste storage site at Nevada's Yucca Mountain.\\"[83] The court opinion said that the NRC was \\"simply flouting the law\\" in its previous action to allow the Obama administration to continue plans to close the proposed waste site since a federal law designating Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository remains in effect. The court opinion stated that \\"The president may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections.\\"[83] In response, NRC issued the final volumes of the Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report (SER), this presented the NRC staffs statement that the site would meet all applicable standards. At the same time, the staff also stated that NRC should not authorize actual construction of the repository until the requirements for land and water rights were met and a supplement to DOEs environmental impact statement (EIS) was finished.[94] On March 3, 2015, NRC ordered the staff to complete the supplemental EIS and make the Yucca Mountain licensing document database publicly available, using all the remaining previously appropriated licensing funds.[95]\\r\\nIn March, 2015 the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S854) was introduced in the U.S. Senate. Its was intended establish a fully independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) which would develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Construction of such facilities would require the consent of the state, local,and tribal governments which would be affected. The NWA would be required to complete a mission plan to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for nuclear waste from non-operating reactors and other \\"emergency\\" deliveries (called priority waste). The goal would be to have a storage facility for waste from operating reactors or other non-priority waste available by 2025, and an actual permanent repository by the end of 2048. The current disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the nations initial permanent repository would be repealed. Any nuclear waste fees collected after S854 was enacted would be held in a newly established Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration would be allowed to draw from that fund any amounts needed to carry out S.854, unless limited by annual appropriations or authorizations.[96]\\r\\nCoordinates: 365110N 1162536W? / ?36.85278N 116.42667W? / 36.85278; -116.42667","input":"In what state was the yucca mountain repository being built?"},{"output":"three","context":"Joseph Jean-Pierre Marc Garneau, PC MP CC CD FCASI (born February 23, 1949) is a Canadian politician and the Minister of Transport in the Government of Canada.

Garneau later withdrew his nomination papers and announced he no longer had an interest in politics. In October 2007, Garneau and Dion held a joint news conference where they announced that Garneau would be the Liberal Party candidate in WestmountVille-Marie.[12] Robillard announced her resignation as Member of Parliament in January and a by-election was later scheduled for September 8, 2008.[14][15] However, the by-election was cancelled during the campaign when Prime Minister Stephen Harper called a general election for October 14, 2008. Though some pundits predicted a close race between Garneau and NDP candidate Anne Lagac-Dowson, Garneau went on to win the riding by over 9,000 votes.[2][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarneau was narrowly re-elected in the 2011 election where he beat New Democratic Party candidate Joanne Corbeil. He was Liberal House Leader and served as Liberal Foreign affairs Critic. He was a candidate for interim leadership of the Liberal Party, but was ultimately defeated by Bob Rae.[17][18] Garneau announced later that year that he was considering a bid for the permanent leadership of the party.[19] In the summer of 2012, he announced that he was looking for a \\"dream team\\" to run his leadership bid and that he would only run if he could find the right people.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 21, 2012, Garneau was named his party's Natural Resources critic after David McGuinty resigned the post.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 28, 2012, Garneau announced his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party, placing a heavy focus on the economy.[23][24] While fellow leadership candidate Justin Trudeau was widely seen as the frontrunner in the race, Garneau was thought to be his main challenger among the candidates.[25] With his entrance into the leadership race he resigned his post as Liberal House Leader, while remaining the party's critic for Natural Resources.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the press conference announcing his candidacy Garneau ruled out any form of co-operation with the Green Party or New Democratic Party to help defeat the Conservative Party in the next election, which was proposed by leadership candidate Joyce Murray.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 30, 2013, Garneau was replaced as Natural Resources critic by Ted Hsu. Garneau had been serving in the position on an interim basis[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 March 2013 Garneau announced his withdrawal from the race, and threw his support to front-runner Justin Trudeau. On September 18, 2013, Garneau was named co-chair of the Liberal International Affairs Council of Advisors, providing advice on foreign and defence issues to Liberal Party of Canada leader Justin Trudeau.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2015 elections held on October 19, 2015, Garneau was re-elected a Parliamentarian in the newly created riding of Notre-Dame-de-GraceWestmount. Two weeks later, on November 4, 2015, Garneau was appointed Transport Minister of Canada in the federal Cabinet headed by Justin Trudeau.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, Garneau introduced an airline passenger bill of rights to standardize how passengers can be treated by airlines which operate any flights in and out of Canada. The legislation would create minimum compensation rates for overbooking, lost or damaged luggage, and bumping passengers off flights. It would also prohibit airlines from removing people from the flight if they have bought a ticket and set the standard for tarmac delays and airline treatment of passengers when flights are delayed or cancelled over events in the airline's control, or because of weather conditions.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarneau was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1984 in recognition of his role as the first Canadian astronaut.  He was promoted the rank of Companion within the order in 2003 for his extensive work with Canada's space program.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration for 12 years of honourable service with the Canadian Forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is honoured with a high school named after him, Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute in Toronto [33] and .S.P. Marc-Garneau[34] in Trenton, Ontario.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarneau is the Honorary Captain of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets. In addition, no 599 Royal Canadian Air Cadets squadron is named in his honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarneau was awarded the Key to the City of Ottawa from Marion Dewar the Mayor of Ottawa on 10 December 1984.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin Trudeau","input":"How many journeys did canada's first astronaut make to space?"},{"output":"an average composition similar to that of andesite","context":"In geology, the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet, dwarf planet or natural satellite, which is chemically distinct from the underlying mantle. The crusts of Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Io, and other planetary bodies have been generated largely by igneous processes, and these crusts are richer in incompatible elements than their respective mantles. The Earth's crust is composed of distinctly different continental crust and oceanic crust, which have different chemical compositions and physical properties, and which were formed by different geological processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crust of the Earth is composed of a great variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The crust is underlain by the mantle. The upper part of the mantle is composed mostly of peridotite, a rock denser than rocks common in the overlying crust. The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity, a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity. The crust occupies less than 1% of Earth's volume.[1]\\r\\nThe crust of the Earth is of two distinctive types: oceanic and continental. The oceanic crust is 5?km (3?mi) to 10?km (6?mi) thick[2] and is composed primarily of basalt, diabase, and gabbro. The continental crust is typically from 30?km (20?mi) to 50?km (30?mi) thick and is mostly composed of slightly less dense rocks than those of the oceanic crust. Some of these less dense rocks, such as granite, are common in the continental crust but rare to absent in the oceanic crust.\\r\\nBoth the continental and oceanic crust \\"float\\" on the mantle. Because the continental crust is thicker, it extends both to greater elevations and greater depth than the oceanic crust. The slightly lower density of felsic continental rock compared to basaltic oceanic rock contributes to the higher relative elevation of the top of the continental crust. As the top of the continental crust reaches elevations higher than that of the oceanic, water runs off the continents and collects above the oceanic crust. Because of the change in velocity of seismic waves it is believed that beneath continents at a certain depth continental crust (sial) becomes close in its physical properties to oceanic crust (sima), and the transition zone is referred to as the Conrad discontinuity.\\r\\nThe temperature of the crust increases with depth,[3] reaching values typically in the range from about 200?C (392?F) to 400?C (752?F) at the boundary with the underlying mantle. The crust and underlying relatively rigid uppermost mantle make up the lithosphere. Because of convection in the underlying plastic (although non-molten) upper mantle and asthenosphere, the lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move. The temperature increases by as much as 30?C (54?F) for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust, but the geothermal gradient is smaller in deeper crust.[4]\\r\\nPartly by analogy to what is known about the Moon, Earth is considered to have differentiated from an aggregate of planetesimals into its core, mantle and crust within about 100 million years of the formation of the planet, 4.6 billion years ago. During the Hadean, the primordial crust was very thin and was probably destroyed by much more vigorous plate tectonics, volcanic activity and significant asteroid impacts,[5] which were much more common in the early stages of the solar system.\\r\\nEarth has probably always had some form of basaltic crust, but the age of the oldest oceanic crust today is only about 200? million years. In contrast, the bulk of the continental crust is much older. The oldest continental crustal rocks on Earth have ages in the range from about 3.7 to 4.28? billion years [6][7] and have been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane in Western Australia, in the Acasta Gneiss in the Northwest Territories on the Canadian Shield, and on other cratonic regions such as those on the Fennoscandian Shield. Some zircon with age as great as 4.3 billion years has been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane.\\r\\nThe average age of the current Earth's continental crust has been estimated to be about 2.0?billion years.[8] Most crustal rocks formed before 2.5 billion years ago are located in cratons. Such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in Earth and so are not readily destroyed by subduction. Formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense orogeny; these periods coincide with the formation of the supercontinents such as Rodinia, Pangaea and Gondwana. The crust forms in part by aggregation of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts, and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle.\\r\\nThe continental crust has an average composition similar to that of andesite.[9] The most abundant minerals in Earth's continental crust are feldspars, which make up about 41% of the crust by weight, followed by quartz at 12%, and pyroxenes at 11%.[10] Continental crust is enriched in incompatible elements compared to the basaltic ocean crust and much enriched compared to the underlying mantle. Although the continental crust comprises only about 0.6 weight percent of the silicate on Earth, it contains 20% to 70% of the incompatible elements.\\r\\nAll the other constituents except water occur only in very small quantities and total less than 1%. Estimates of average density for the upper crust range between 2.69 and 2.74 g/cm3 and for lower crust between 3.0 and 3.25 g/cm3.[11]\\r\\nA theoretical protoplanet named \\"Theia\\" is thought to have collided with the forming Earth, and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the Moon. As the Moon formed, the outer part of it is thought to have been molten, a lunar magma ocean. Plagioclase feldspar crystallized in large amounts from this magma ocean and floated toward the surface. The cumulate rocks form much of the crust. The upper part of the crust probably averages about 88% plagioclase (near the lower limit of 90% defined for anorthosite): the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the pyroxenes and olivine, but even that lower part probably averages about 78% plagioclase.[12] The underlying mantle is denser and olivine-rich.\\r\\nThe thickness of the crust ranges between about 20 and 120?km. Crust on the far side of the Moon averages about 12?km thicker than that on the near side. Estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about 50 to 60?km. Most of this plagioclase-rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon, between about 4.5 and 4.3 billion years ago. Perhaps 10% or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase-rich material. The best-characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare basalts formed between about 3.9 and 3.2 billion years ago. Minor volcanism continued after 3.2 billion years, perhaps as recently as 1 billion years ago. There is no evidence of plate tectonics.\\r\\nStudy of the Moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than Earth. Although the radius of the Moon is only about a quarter that of Earth, the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness. This thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the Moon. Magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about 3.9 billion years ago, but igneous rocks younger than 3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust.[13]","input":"Whats the composition of the earth's crust?"},{"output":"around 3000 years ago","context":"","input":"When did tasmanian devils go extinct on the mainland?"},{"output":"January 12, 1966, to March 14, 1968","context":"Batman is a 1960s American live action television series, based on the DC comic book character of the same name. It stars Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin ÿ two crime-fighting heroes who defend Gotham City from a variety of arch villains.[1][2] It is known for its camp style, upbeat theme music, and its intentionally humorous, simplistic morality (aimed at its largely teenage audience). This included championing the importance of using seat belts, doing homework, eating vegetables, and drinking milk.[3] It was described by executive producer William Dozier as the only situation comedy on the air without a laugh track. 120 episodes aired on the ABC network for three seasons from January 12, 1966, to March 14, 1968, twice weekly for the first two and weekly for the third. In 2016, television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked Batman as the 82nd greatest American television show of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOstensibly a crime series, the style of the show was in fact campy and tongue-in-cheek. It was a true situation comedy, in that situations were exaggerated and were generally played for laughs. This increased as the seasons progressed, with the addition of ever greater absurdity. The characters, however, always took the absurd situations extremely seriously ÿ which added to the comedy. Both Main Characters had the Main Initial between names, B Batman, Bruce. R Robin, Richard (Dick).\\r\\nThe series focused on the adventures of Batman and Robin. Although the lives of their alter-egos, millionaire Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson (Richard John Grayson) were frequently shown, it was usually only briefly, in the context of their being called away on superhero business, or in circumstances where they needed to employ their secret identities to assist in their crime-fighting. The \\"Dynamic Duo\\" typically come to the aid of the Gotham City Police upon the latter being stumped by a supervillain. Throughout each episode, Batman and Robin have to follow a series of (wildly improbable) clues to discover the supervillain's plan, then figure out how to thwart that plan and capture the criminal.\\r\\nFor the first two seasons, Batman aired twice a week on consecutive nights. Every story is a two-parter, except for two three-parters featuring villainous team ups (The Joker and The Penguin, The Penguin and Marsha, Queen of Diamonds) in the second season. The titles of each multi-part story usually rhymed. For the third season, which aired one episode a week, most episodes were self-contained stories. However, each episode would end with a teaser featuring the next episode's guest villain. The cliffhangers between multiple-parters typically consisted of the supervillain holding someone captive, usually the Dynamic Duo, with the captives being subject to some elaborate, gruesome ÿ if unlikely ÿ death. This would inevitably be resolved early in the follow-up episode.\\r\\nEach story relied on using the same formula, so that the audience quickly came to expect a series of familiar set pieces: a phone call from the police asking for Batman's help, a dash to the Batcave, a race in the Batmobile to police headquarters, a conference in the Commissioner's office, investigating the scene of the crime, examining clues in the crime-lab at the Batcave, rushing to the villain's secret hideout, falling into the pre-arranged trap. By relying heavily on a formula, it became easy to spoof various elements of that formula.\\r\\nThe typical story begins with a villain's caper (such as stealing a fabulous treasure, kidnapping a prominent person, or attempting to take over Gotham City). In his office, Commissioner Gordon, along with Chief O'Hara, learn of the crime and the culprit. Helpless to stop the villain, they contact Batman via the Batphone ÿ a bright red telephone that provides a direct phone link to Batman (be it at Wayne Manor, the Batcave or the Batmobile). At \\"stately Wayne Manor\\", Alfred (Wayne's butler) answers the Batphone and informs Bruce Wayne of the call. Frequently, Wayne and his ward, Dick Grayson, are found talking with Dick's aunt, Harriet Cooper, who is unaware of Bruce and Dick's secret identities. Alfred discreetly interrupts and they excuse themselves to go to the Batphone in Wayne's study. Upon learning the details from Gordon, Wayne turns a switch concealed within a bust of Shakespeare that stands on his desk to reveal two fireman's poles hidden behind a sliding bookcase. \\"To the Batpoles!\\" Wayne exclaims, and he and Grayson slide down the poles that lead to the Batcave.\\r\\nThe title sequence features animated versions of Batman and Robin, drawn in the then-current style of the comic books, running towards camera and then fighting an assortment of villains, including several \\"marquee\\" villains such as the Joker and the Penguin.\\r\\nSimilar in style and content to the 1940s serials, Batman and Robin would arrive at the bottom of the Batpoles in the Batcave in full costume (reference is made later in the series to some sort of costuming device that functions on the way down the poles). They then jump into the Batmobile. Robin checks the gauges and reports, \\"Atomic batteries to power...turbines to speed.\\" Batman responds, \\"Roger, ready to move out.\\" With that, the two would drive out of the cave at high speed. As the Batmobile approached the mouth of the cave (actually a tunnel entrance in Los Angeles's Bronson Canyon), a camouflaged door would swing open and a hinged road barrier outside the Batcave would drop down to allow the car to exit onto the road. The duo then speeds to police headquarters to meet with Gordon and be briefed on the criminal they must thwart. Most of the footage following the opening title sequence from Batman and Robin sliding down the Batpoles through their arrival at police headquarters was reused in each episode. After the National Safety Council complained that Batman and Robin should set a good example, the repeated sequence was changed to show them fastening seat belts before starting out.[4][5]\\r\\nThe initial discussion of the crime usually leads to Batman and Robin conducting their investigation alone, although the police are often used for assistance and to implement plans or traps that Batman devises to catch the villain. Typically Batman and Robin must use deduction from the clues left by the villain to determine elements such as the villain's identity, plan, target, and/or location. This usually results in a meeting with the villain, a fistfight with the villain's henchmen, and the villain's escape, leaving a further series of unlikely clues for the duo to investigate. Later, they would face the villain's henchmen again, be captured and one or both heroes placed in a deathtrap leading to a cliffhanger ending, which was usually resolved in the first few minutes of the next episode.\\r\\nThe latter part(s) of multi-episode stories begins with a brief recap of the first part(s). After the opening credits and the theme music, the cliffhanger is resolved.\\r\\nThe same general plot pattern of investigation and confrontation repeats in the following episode until the villain is defeated in a major brawl.\\r\\nThe series used a narrator (executive producer William Dozier, uncredited) who parodied both the breathless narration style of the 1940s serials and Walter Winchell's bombastic narration of The Untouchables. He would end many of the cliffhanger episodes by intoning, \\"Tune in tomorrow?ÿ same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!\\" In the episodes following cliffhangers, recaps of the previous episode consisted of a series of short phrases from Dozier accompanying short, silent clips of the prior episode, which usually ending in a freeze-frame. In the third season, when single-episode stories were introduced, the narrator would end the show by encouraging viewers to tune in the following week.\\r\\nDuring the climactic fistfights in each episode, the punches and other impacts were punctuated by onomatopoeia (sound effects) superimposed in bright colors over the action on the screen, as in comic-book fight scenes (\\"POW!\\", \\"BAM!\\", \\"ZONK!\\", etc.). As a money saving device, after the first season, instead of being superimposed over the fight scene, the sound effects were merely printed on cards and inserted into the action.\\r\\nDespite the regular fighting on the show, Batman and Robin typically use non-lethal force; only three criminal characters die during the series: the Riddler's moll Molly (played by Jill St. John in the pilot episode), who accidentally falls into the Batcave's atomic reactor, and two out-of-town gunmen who shoot at Batman and Robin, but kill each other instead, toward the end of \\"Zelda The Great/A Death Worse Than Fate\\". In the film, six criminals die in total: Five henchmen are dehydrated by the Penguin in order to infiltrate the Batcave, but this plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck. A sixth henchman is presumably killed when he is caught in a trap meant for Batman and sprung into an exploding octopus. Twice, the Catwoman (Julie Newmar) appears to fall to her death (into a bottomless pit and from a high building into a river), but returned in later episodes. In \\"Instant Freeze\\", Mr. Freeze freezes a butler solid and knocks him over, and sound-effects suggest that he is shattered into pieces. A later reference suggests the butler survived. In \\"Green Ice\\", Mr. Freeze freezes a policeman solid; it is left unclear whether he survived. In \\"The Penguin's Nest\\", a policeman suffers an electric shock at the hands of the Penguin's accomplices, but he is presumed to survive, as he appears in some later episodes.\\r\\nA catch-phrase popularized by the series was Robin's saying \\"Holy [subject], Batman!\\" whenever he encountered something startling. This phrase was parodied in the 1995 film Batman Forever.\\r\\nIn many episodes, Batman and Robin must get to a high point of a building or other structure. They do this via the Batrope which is thrown and anchored above the high point, and which Batman and Robin climb by walking up the side of the structure with the aid of the rope. The climbing sequences were filmed by rotating the camera 90 degrees and building a set for the \\"side\\" of the structure along the studio floor. The heroes' capes were pulled back (to replicate the pull of gravity) with invisible lines. In many episodes, celebrities made cameo appearances by popping their heads out of windows along these climbs to speak to the heroes.\\r\\nIn one episode, the Catwoman's hideout is a hair salon owned by a \\"Mr. Oceanbring.\\" The real-life inspiration for the character, hair stylist (and future Manson family victim) Jay Sebring, appears uncredited during the fight scene and has a couple of spoken lines.\\r\\nThe villains commonly have henchmen whose names are somehow associated with the villain's identity; for example, Catwoman's henchmen have cat-related names like Felix and Leo. Characters commonly use alliterations. Examples include Batman referring to the Joker as a \\"hateful harlequin\\" and the Penguin calling Catwoman a \\"feline floozy\\".\\r\\nOnly two of the show's guest villains ever discovered Batman's true identity: Egghead by deductive reasoning, and King Tut on two occasions?ÿ the first time with a bug placed on the Batmobile and the second time by accidentally mining into the Batcave. Egghead was tricked into disbelieving his discovery, though, as was Tut in the episode when he bugged the Batmobile. In the episode when Tut tunneled into the Batcave, he was hit on the head by a rock, which made him forget his discovery and jarred him back into his identity as a mild-mannered professor of Egyptology at Yale University. While under the spell of the Siren (Joan Collins), Commissioner Gordon found the Batcave beneath Wayne Manor and deduced Batman's true identity, but Alfred gassed him to prevent his informing her, the memory of the discovery gone after leaving the Siren's spell.\\r\\nThe show's campiness was played up in elements, including the design of the villains, dialogue and in signs appearing on various props. Batman would frequently reveal one of his many crime-fighting gadgets, which were usually given a ridiculous-sounding name that somehow incorporated the word \\"bat\\"?ÿ often simply by adding the word \\"bat\\" to an otherwise normal descriptor, such as Shark Repellant Bat-Spray, Bat-Computer, Extra-Strong Bat-Knockout Gas, etc. Most of Batman's items in the Batcave, bat-vehicles and on the utility belt were given superfluous and simplistic block-letter labels, even though Batman, Robin and Alfred, the only people who used the equipment, clearly knew what all of it was.\\r\\nAccording to Adam West's memoir, Back to the Batcave, his first exposure to the series concept was through reading a sample script in which Batman enters a nightclub in his complete costume and requests a booth near the wall, as he \\"shouldn't wish to attract attention\\". It was the scrupulously formal dialogue, and the way that Batman earnestly believed he could avoid standing out while wearing a skintight blue-and-grey costume, that convinced West of the character's comic potential.\\r\\nWith the death of Adam West on June 9, 2017, Burt Ward is now the sole surviving main Batman cast member.\\r\\nList of Batman television series characters\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, Ed Graham Productions optioned the television rights to the comic strip Batman and planned a straightforward juvenile adventure show, much like Adventures of Superman and The Lone Ranger, to air on CBS on Saturday mornings.\\r\\nEast Coast ABC executive Yale Udoff, a Batman fan in his childhood, contacted ABC executives Harve Bennett and Edgar J. Scherick, who were already considering developing a television series based on a comic-strip action hero, to suggest a prime-time Batman series in the hip and fun style of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. When negotiations between CBS and Graham stalled, DC Comics quickly reobtained rights and made the deal with ABC, which farmed the rights out to 20th Century Fox to produce the series.[6]\\r\\nIn turn, 20th Century Fox handed the project to William Dozier and his production company, Greenway Productions. ABC and Fox were expecting a hip and funyet still seriousadventure show. However, Dozier, who had never before read comic books, concluded, after reading several Batman comics for research, that the only way to make the show work was to do it as a pop-art campy comedy.[7] Originally, espionage novelist Eric Ambler was to have scripted a TV movie that would launch the television series, but he dropped out after learning of Dozier's campy comedy approach. Eventually, two sets of screen tests were filmed, one with Adam West and Burt Ward and the other with Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell, with West and Ward winning the roles.\\r\\nLorenzo Semple, Jr. had signed on as head script writer. He wrote the pilot script, and generally wrote in a pop-art adventure style. Stanley Ralph Ross, Stanford Sherman, and Charles Hoffman were script writers who generally leaned more toward campy comedy, and in Ross's case, sometimes outright slapstick and satire. It was originally intended as a one-hour show, but ABC pushed up the premiere date from fall 1966 to January of that year. With the network having only two early-evening half-hour time slots available, the show was split into two parts, to air twice a week in 30-minute installments. A cliffhanger connected the two episodes, echoing the old movie serials.\\r\\nThe Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, and the Mad Hatter, villains who originated in the comic books, all appeared in the series, the plots for which were deliberately villain driven. According to the producers, Frank Gorshin was selected to portray the Riddler due to the fact that he was a Batman fan since childhood. Catwoman was portrayed by three different actresses during the series run: by Julie Newmar in the first two seasons, by Lee Meriwether in the feature film based on the series, and by Eartha Kitt in the third and final season.\\r\\nSemple's participation in the series decreased in the second season. In his autobiography Back to the Batcave, Adam West explained to Jeff Rovin, to whom he dictated the autobiography after rejecting an offer to contribute to The Official \\"Batman\\" Batbook, written by Joel Eisner, that when work on the second season commenced following the completion of the feature film, Dozier, his immediate deputy Howie Horwitz, and the rest of the cast and crew rushed their preparation. Thus, they failed to give themselves enough time to determine what they wanted to do with the series during season two.\\r\\nBy season three, ratings were falling and the future of the series seemed uncertain. To attract new viewers, Dozier opted to introduce a female character. He came up with the idea of using Batgirl, who in her civilian identity would be Commissioner Gordon's daughter, Barbara, and asked the editor of the Batman comics to further develop the character (who had made her debut in a 1966 issue of Detective Comics).[8] To convince ABC executives to introduce Batgirl as a regular on the show, a promotional short featuring Yvonne Craig as Batgirl and Tim Herbert as Killer Moth was produced.[9] The show was reduced to once a week, with mostly self-contained episodes, although the following week's villain would be introduced in a tag at the end of each episode, similar to a soap opera. Accordingly, the narrator's cliffhanger phrases were mostly eliminated, most episodes ending with him encouraging viewers to watch next week .[notes 1]\\r\\nAunt Harriet was reduced to just two cameo appearances during the third season, due to Madge Blake's poor health and the issue of trying to fit so many characters (Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara and a guest villain) into a half hour episode. Another cast change for the final season was replacing Julie Newmar, who had been a popular recurring guest villain as the Catwoman for the first two seasons. Singer-actress Eartha Kitt assumed the role for season three, as Newmar was working on the film Mackenna's Gold at that time, hence she was unable to appear. In the United States, Kitt's performance in the series marked the second mainstream television success of a black female, following Nichelle Nichols as Lt. Uhura in Star Trek and continued breaking the racial boundaries of the time. Kitt's performance as Catwoman would also, later, inspire Halle Berry's portrayal of the character in the 2004 film Catwoman, in which Berry would mimic Kitt's famous purrs. Frank Gorshin, the original actor to play the Riddler, returned for a single appearance after a one-season hiatus, during which John Astin made one appearance in the role.\\r\\nThe nature of the scripts and acting started to enter into the realm of surrealism. For example, the set's backgrounds became mere two-dimensional cut-outs against a stark black stage. In addition, the third season was much more topical, with references to hippies, mods, and distinctive 1960s slang, which the previous two seasons had avoided.\\r\\nNear the end of the third season, ratings had dropped significantly, and ABC cancelled the show. But NBC had agreed to take over the series and was ready to continue. Before that could happen, it was discovered that someone had destroyed the Batman sets which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build, and the deal with NBC was lost.[10] Reruns of the series have been seen on a regular basis in the United States. They are currently shown on the classic TV networks Heroes & Icons on Saturday mornings, MeTV on Saturday nights,[11] weekdays dubbed in Spanish on TeleXitos, as well as Saturday mornings on IFC.[12]\\r\\nSeveral cast members recorded music tied into the series. Adam West released a single titled \\"Miranda\\", a country-tinged pop song that he actually performed in costume during live appearances in the 1960s. Frank Gorshin released a song titled \\"The Riddler\\", which was composed and arranged by Mel Torm. Burgess Meredith recorded a spoken-word single called \\"The Escape\\" backed with \\"The Capture\\", which consisted of the Penguin narrating his recent crime spree to a jazz beat. Burt Ward recorded a song called \\"Boy Wonder, I Love You\\", written and arranged by Frank Zappa.\\r\\nIn 1966, Batman: The Exclusive Original Soundtrack Album was released on LP, featuring music by Nelson Riddle and snippets of dialogue from Adam West, Burt Ward, Burgess Meredith, Frank Gorshin, Anne Baxter (as Zelda the Great) and George Sanders (the first Mr. Freeze). The Batman Theme was included, along with titles like Batusi A Go! Go!, Batman Thaws Mr. Freeze and Batman Blues. It was reissued later on compact disc.\\r\\nThe show featured numerous adaptations of various Batman comics stories ÿ particularly in its first season. These first-season episodes were adaptations:\\r\\nVan Williams and Bruce Lee made a cameo appearance as the Green Hornet and Kato in \\"window cameos\\" while the Batman and Robin were climbing a building. This was in part one of a two-part second-season episode of the Batman TV series, \\"The Spell of Tut\\", which aired on September 28, 1966.[13]\\r\\nLater that same season, the Green Hornet and Kato appeared in the two-part second-season episodes A Piece of the Action and Batman's Satisfaction, which aired on March 1ÿ2, 1967. In the two episodes, the Green Hornet and Kato are in Gotham City to bust a counterfeit stamp ring run by Colonel Gumm (portrayed by Roger C. Carmel).[14] The Batman's Satisfaction episode leads to a mixed fight, with both Batman & Robin and The Green Hornet & Kato fighting Colonel Gumm and his gang. Once Gumm's crew was defeated, Batman and Robin squared off against The Green Hornet and Kato, resulting in a stand-off that was interrupted by the police. In this episode, Batman, Robin and the police consider the Green Hornet and Kato to be criminals, although Batman and Robin were cordial to the duo in the earlier window appearance. There is also a mention of The Green Hornet TV series on the Batman TV series episode The Impractical Joker (episode 55, Part 1, aired November 16, 1966): while watching TV together, Alfred, Dick Grayson and Bruce Wayne (who says, \\"It's time to watch The Green Hornet\\", and you hear the Hornet buzzing sound) are interrupted by the Joker; then, after the interruption, The Green Hornet TV series theme music is heard.\\r\\nIn the December 9, 1966 Green Hornet episode \\"The Secret Of The Sally Bell\\", the Batmobile can be seen revolving on its turntable floor in the batcave on a bad guy's TV set. In the February 3, 1967 Green Hornet episode \\"Ace in the Hole\\" (which aired between the September 1966 and March 1967 Batman appearances mentioned above), Batman and Robin can be seen climbing a building on a television set. There was one other Green Hornet & Kato appearance that was not on the Batman TV series nor on The Green Hornet TV series: a segment of the Milton Berle Show/The Hollywood Palace aired in the Fall of 1966 brought together The Green Hornet and Kato (Van Williams and Bruce Lee), and Batman (Adam West), in a comedy sketch with Milton Berle, in which Bruce Lee demonstrates his martial arts expertise. Burt Ward as \\"Robin\\" was not included in this appearance.\\r\\nThe live action television show was extraordinarily popular, called \\"the biggest TV phenomenon of the mid-1960s\\".[15] At the height of its popularity, it was the only prime-time television show other than Peyton Place to be broadcast twice in one week as part of its regular schedule, airing at 7:30?pm Wednesdays and Thursdays. Episodes of the show were filmed as two-part cliffhangers, with each storyline beginning on Wednesday and ending on the Thursday episode. (In the second season, a pair of three-parters was also seen; at the very end of the Thursday night segment, a brief tag featuring the next week's villain would be shown, such as, \\"Next week: Batman jousts with The Joker again!\\" This started on the third week of the series' run and continued until the end of season two. The first episode of a storyline would typically end with Batman and Robin being in a deathtrap, while the narrator (Dozier) would tell viewers to watch the next night with the repeated phrase: \\"Tune in tomorrowsame Bat-time, same Bat-channel!\\" Even decades after the show ceased production, this catch-phrase remains a long-running punchline in popular culture.\\r\\nThe \\"Captain Crocodile\\" episode of the TV series The Monkees featured a parody segment devoted to \\"Frogman\\" and \\"Reuben the Tadpole\\" (played, respectively, by Peter Tork and Davy Jones) combating the criminal forces of Michael Nesmith and Micky Dolenz.[16]\\r\\nTelevision critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked Batman as the 82nd greatest American television show of all time in their 2016 book titled TV (The Book), stating that \\"West's performance, the brilliance of which has required decades to be properly recognized, played as if series creator William Dozier and chief developer Lorenzo Semple, Jr., had taken the establishment's fantasy of itself and dolled it up in tights and a cape .... The anarchic gangs of supervillains and henchmen that kept trying to capture or destroy Gotham City stood in for the forces of chaos that kept threatening to engulf so-called civilized America throughout the sixties, only made colorfully grotesque and knowingly silly.\\"[17] In 1997, TV Guide ranked the episodes \\"The Purr-fect Crime\\" and \\"Better Luck Next Time\\" #86 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.[18] In 2009, \\"Better Luck Next Time\\" was ranked #72.[19]\\r\\nThe Batman character appeared in two public service announcements.\\r\\nIn 1966, West, as Batman, encouraged schoolchildren to heed then-President Lyndon B. Johnson's call for them to buy U.S. Savings stamps, a children's version of U.S. Savings bonds, to support the Vietnam War.[20]\\r\\nIn a 1974 PSA for the U.S. Department of Labor Wage & Hour Division narrated by William Dozier, Batman and Robin were tied to a post amid the threat of a ticking time bomb, but Batgirl (Yvonne Craig) refused to release them because she was paid less than Robin (Burt Ward), in violation of the Federal Equal Pay Law.[21] Dick Gautier played Batman this time, because West was, at the time, trying to distance himself from the role.\\r\\nThe series' stars, Adam West and Burt Ward, were typecast for decades afterwards, with West especially finding himself unable to escape the reputation of a hammy, camp actor. However, years after the series' impact faded, an episode of Batman: The Animated Series paid tribute to West with an episode titled \\"Beware The Gray Ghost\\". In this episode, West himself provided the voice of an aging star of a superhero television series Bruce Wayne had watched as a child and from which he later found inspiration. This gave West new popularity with the next generation of fans. He also played Gotham City's Mayor Grange as a somewhat recurring role in The Batman. In addition, West played the voice of Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne's father in the episode \\"Chill of the Night\\" from the series Batman: The Brave and the Bold.\\r\\nThe original Batmobile from the 1960s TV series was auctioned on January 19, 2013, at the Barrett-Jackson auction house in Scottsdale, Arizona.[22] It was sold for $4.2 million.[23]\\r\\nThe animated television series Batman: The Brave and the Bold is influenced by the 1960s television series. The opening credits feature Batman rope-climbing up a building, something that Adam West and Burt Ward often did in the show.[24] Several villains from the 1960s show including King Tut, Egghead, Mad Hatter, Archer, Bookworm, False Face, Black Widow, Siren, Marsha Queen of Diamonds, Louie the Lilac, Ma Parker, and Shame make cameo appearances as prisoners at Iron Heights prison in the episode \\"Day of the Dark Knight!\\" They are all captured by Batman and Green Arrow during a mass escape attempt. In Mayhem of the Music Meister! the same villains have brief cameos. The episode \\"Game Over for Owlman!\\" shows a room in the Batcave containing \\"souvenirs\\" of deathtraps that the Joker employed in the 1960s series, with accompanying flashbacks: the giant key from the \\"Human Key Duplicator\\" from \\"The Impractical Joker\\", the slot machine-controlled electric chair from \\"The Joker Goes to School\\", and the giant clam from \\"The Joker's Hard Times\\". The episode \\"The Color of Revenge!\\" begins with a flashback to the time of the 1960s television series, using attributes such as the red Batphone, the Shakespeare bust, the sliding bookcase, the Batpoles, Robin in his old television-series costume, and the shot of Batman and Robin fastening their seat belts in the Batmobile. Additionally, the Adam West Batman briefly appears in \\"Night of the Batmen!\\" as part of an army of Batmen gathered across the Multiverse.\\r\\nThe Young Justice episode \\"Schooled\\" briefly references the show, as well, by featuring a Shakespeare bust in Bruce's office at the Waynetech building in Metropolis. As a further homage to the series, Bruce is shown accessing an emergency Batsuit hidden in his desk by flipping a switch concealed within the bust.\\r\\nAdam West and Burt Ward lend their voices and likeness to the third DC Comics Special on Robot Chicken. In the plot, when Batman brings over a Superman from another dimension to make him jealous, Superman retaliates by bringing the Adam West Batman, who trumps the Robot Chicken Batman by addressing the glucose issue of muffins and dancing. He is later seen battling the Arkham versions of Batman's villains and is killed by Penguin's anthrax gas. Burt Ward kidnaps him as well as the Robot Chicken Robin and takes them to the Lazarus Pit, where he resurrects West's Batman and makes himself younger to relive the glory days. He only kidnapped Robot Chicken Robin so he could have his outfit.\\r\\nA line spoken by Robin (Chris O'Donnell) in Batman Forever is a homage to the television Robin's catch-phrase exclamations that started \\"Holy\\" and sometimes ended \\"Batman!\\" - for instance \\"Holy bargain basements, Batman!\\" (from the television series' first season) and \\"Holy flypaper, Batman!\\" (from the television series' second season). During the movie, Robin says \\"Holy rusted metal, Batman!\\" after the duo climbs onto twisted metal girders beside some water. This catchphrase also appeared for a time in Batman comic books.\\r\\nIn the third episode of Birds of Prey \\"Prey for the Hunter\\", the famous William Shakespeare bust from the series has a cameo. However, instead of bending the neck back to expose the button, it is simply turned to the left, giving it the same functionexposing a hidden passageway.\\r\\nIn the film, a damaged car belonging to Flounder's older brother (which was earlier reported stolen) was re-purposed for the climactic scene by Bluto and D-Day. The car initially appears as a parade float depicting a layer cake, with the words 'Eat Me' on the front; when the float is cut away, it reveals the car repainted in black and red, in a style similar to the Batmobile of the television series, but also incorporating a black armored turret with the word 'DEATHMOBILE' on it in red. This would technically be anachronistic, as the film is set in 1962, but given the parodic nature of the film this is generally ignored.\\r\\nIn Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, an extra level is based on the 1966 Batman TV series, along with characters including: 1966 Batman, 1966 Robin; 1966 Batgirl, 1966 Joker, 1966 Catwoman, 1966 Riddler, and 1966 Penguin. Also, Adam West is a playable character. The 1966 Batmobile is also included as a drivable vehicle. The end credits sequence remakes the Batclimb window cameos.\\r\\nA film based on the television show, Batman, was released in 1966. The film was originally intended to be produced before the series as a way to introduce the series to the public. However, the series' premiere was moved up and the film was forced to wait until the summer hiatus after the first season. The film was produced quickly to get into theatres prior to the start of season two of the television series.\\r\\nThe film did not initially perform well at the cinema. Originally, the movie had been conceived to help sell the television series abroad, but the success of the series in America was sufficient publicity. The film was shot after season one was filmed. The movie's budget allowed for producers to build the Batboat and lease a helicopter that would be made into the Batcopter, both of which were used in the second and third seasons of the television show.[25]\\r\\nWest and Ward announced at the Mad Monster Party that one or two Batman animated movies would be released in 2016 with the two doing voiced roles as their characters for the show's 50th anniversary along with Julie Newmar returning.[26][27]\\r\\nThe trailer for Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders made its debut on August 17, 2016.[28] The film was released on Digital HD and Digital Media on October 11, 2016 and on DVD and Blu-ray November 1, 2016.[29]\\r\\nA sequel to Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders called Batman vs. Two-Face will be released in late 2017. The film will star William Shatner voicing Two-Face as the main antagonist.[30][31] Adam West died before it was released,[32] however he did complete his voiceover work before his passing. This was one of Adam West's final roles before he passed away from leukemia.\\r\\nIn 2013, DC began publication of Batman '66, a comic book series telling all-new stories set in the world of the 1966ÿ68 TV series. Jeff Parker writes the series, which features cover art by Mike Allred and interior art by different artists each issue.[33][34][35] In the course of this series, the Bookworm, the Minstrel, Sandman, Olga Queen of the Cossacks, Zelda The Great, Shame, and Marsha Queen of Diamonds all have their first appearance in Batman comics. Penguin, Joker, Riddler, Catwoman and Mr. Freeze also appear in the series. Issue #3 of Batman '66 introduced the Red Hood and Dr. Quinn into the series continuity. In issue #7, Batman used a new vehicle, the Bat-Jet, to follow False-Face to Mount Rushmore. The series was to have introduced Killer Croc into the continuity, as well as a new villainess named Cleopatra. In April 2014, the first five issues were compiled into the Batman '66 Vol. 1 trade paperback. Kevin Smith and Ralph Garman likewise worked on a Batman and Green Hornet crossover, titled Batman '66 meets The Green Hornet. The six-issue mini-series began publication in June 2014.[36] Jeff Parker wrote a Batman and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. team-up titled Batman '66 meets The Man from U.N.C.L.E. released in 2016.[37] Ian Edginton wrote a Batman team up with John Steed and Emma Peel of The Avengers titled Batman '66/Steed and Mrs. Peel.[38][39][40] Batman teams up with Wonder Woman in the crossover team up \\"Batman' 66 Meets Wonder Woman '77 writing by both Parker and Marc Andreyko.[41] Whether Batman '66 is represented in one of the current New 52 DC Multiverse alternative Earths is uncertain. Thus far, this has not been the case, although several such alternative Earths inhabitants and representative metahumans remain undisclosed.[42]\\r\\nBluewater Comics has released a series of comics that take their cue from the TV show. They are The Mis-Adventures of Adam West, The Secret Lives of Julie Newmar, and Burt Ward, Boy Wonder and are similar in tone to the TV series. The Mis-Adventures of Adam West had a four-issue miniseries, and a regular series that ran nine issues. The Secret Lives of Julie Newmar was a four-issue miniseries and Burt Ward, Boy Wonder was going to be a four-issue miniseries, but has not yet been published.\\r\\nThe company Stern have announced they will release the pinball machine Batman '66, based on the TV series, in November 2016.[43]\\r\\nIn January 2014, Conan O'Brien posted on his Twitter account, and Warner Bros. later confirmed, that Warner Bros. would release an official DVD and Blu-ray boxed set of the complete series sometime in 2014.[45]\\r\\nOn April 10, 2014, the website tvshowsondvd.com quoted Burt Ward in saying that Warner Bros. would release the complete series on November 11, 2014, in time for the holiday season from 20th Century Fox Television, and that Adam West and he were doing special features for the release.\\r\\nPrior to the announcement, multiple conflicting reports were given for the reason the series had not been released officially. These included:\\r\\nThe series, under the Fox/ABC deal, is still in syndication, and regularly shown on a number of channels around the world, currently appearing in the United States on Me-TV and IFC as of July 4, 2014. Until 2014, only the 1966 feature film was available on DVD from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment for nonbroadcast viewing in North America. This affected the 2003 television movie reunion Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt, also released to DVD, which was able to make use of footage only from the 1966 movie.\\r\\nWith Batman being unavailable for home-video release until 2014, an unusual situation occurred in which material that would be considered DVD featurettes was released separately. In 2004, Image Entertainment released Holy Batmania, a two-DVD set that included documentaries on the making of the series, as well as rare footage such as the original screen tests of the cast and Lyle Waggoner.[50] In 2008, Adam West released a privately issued DVD with the tongue-in-cheek title Adam West Naked for which he recorded anecdotes regarding all 120 episodes of the series.[51] In 2013 PBS aired an episode of Pioneers of Television called \\"Superheroes\\" that featured interviews with Adam West and Burt Ward, and talked about the 1960s TV series. It was released on DVD March 11, 2013.\\r\\nAlso in 2013, PBS produced and transmitted a documentary titled Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle. This documentary talked a little bit about the series and included an interview with Adam West.\\r\\nOn November 11, 2014, Warner Bros. released the full 120-episode Batman collection on Blu-ray and DVD with a variety of extras including a miniature Batmobile, a 32-page episode guide, and Adam West Scrapbook.[52] A second box released on Warner Bros.' own batmanondvd website replaces the Batmobile and the trading cards with a script from the episode \\"The Joker is Wild\\" and a bonus box containing the movie and the \\"Adam West Naked\\" documentary. This series is also available at the iTunes Store.\\r\\nStarting in 1966, an enormous amount of Batman merchandise was manufactured and marketed to cash-in on the TV show's vast popularity. This includes trading cards, bubblegum cards, scale model kits of the Batmobile and Batboat, coloring books, and board games. Items from this particular era have gained substantial collector appeal with their remarkable variety, scarcity, and style.\\r\\nOne of the most desired collectibles involves the episodes introducing Catwoman (\\"The Purr-fect Crime\\" / \\"Better Luck Next Time\\"), which were the subject of a View-Master reel & booklet set in 1966 (Sawyers Packet # B492). While the series was first-run on ABC, packet cover indicia reflected the \\"Bat Craze\\" cultural phenomenon by referring to the booklet as a Batbooklet, Dynamically illustrated. By the time the television series was cancelled in 1968 and GAF had taken over the View-Master product, Batbooklet was removed in favor of then-standard View-Master packaging for all future releases in the decades to follow, right up the period when the standard packet line was discontinued. The first season's superimposed fight onomatopoeias were not used for the View-Master's scenes of fights. Instead, black-lined \\"blast\\" balloons (transparent inside), and series-like onomatopoeias were illustrated and superimposed over fight images.\\r\\nThe popularity of the TV series has carried several decades after its debut; toy company Mattel has made the 1966 Batmobile in various scales for the Hot Wheels product line. The Batmobile with Batboat were also produced under the Matchbox and Corgi names in the UK, during this period.\\r\\nWarner Bros. acquired merchandising rights to the series in 2012,[2] and in 2013 Mattel released an action figure line based on the television series. To date only a single series of figures have been produced: Batman, the Riddler, the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman and exclusive to a boxset Robin. Two Batman variants were also produced a limited SDCC exclusive figure with an action feature that replicates the famous Batusi dance and a Surf's Up Batman figure complete with surfboard and trunks. Each figure has the likeness of their respective actor (with Catwoman resembling Newmar and the Riddler resembling Gorshin) and came packaged with a display base and collector card. A Batmobile was also sold to retail making this the first time the classic model has been produced for action figures in the 6-inch scale.\\r\\nIn 2013, Hong Kongÿbased entertainment collectible manufacturer Hot Toys produced ?1?6 scale versions of West's Batman and Ward's Robin.","input":"When did the original batman tv show air?"},{"output":"World War II","context":"\\r\\nThe Tuskegee Airmen /t?s?ki?i?/[1] is the popular name of a group of African-American military pilots (fighter and bomber) who fought in World War II. They formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. The name also applies to the navigators, bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, crew chiefs, nurses, cooks and other support personnel.\\r\\nAll black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Moton Field, the Tuskegee Army Air Field, and were educated at Tuskegee University, located near Tuskegee, Alabama. The group included five Haitians from the Haitian Air Force, and one pilot from Trinidad.[2]. It also included a Hispanic or Latino airman born in the Dominican Republic[3].\\r\\nAlthough the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, they never served in combat. The 99th Pursuit Squadron (later, 99th Fighter Squadron) was the first black flying squadron, and the first to deploy overseas (to North Africa in April 1943, and later to Sicily and Italy). The 332nd Fighter Group, which originally included the 100th, 301st, and 302nd Fighter Squadrons, was the first black flying group. It deployed to Italy in early 1944. In June 1944, the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions, and in July 1944, with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron, it had four fighter squadrons.\\r\\nThe 99th Fighter Squadron was initially equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter-bomber aircraft. The 332nd Fighter Group and its 100th, 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons were equipped for initial combat missions with Bell P-39 Airacobras (March 1944), later with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts (JuneÿJuly 1944), and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated, the North American P-51 Mustang (July 1944). When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P-47s red, the nickname \\"Red Tails\\" was coined. The red markings that distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of P-51s as well as a red rudder; the P-51B and D Mustangs flew with similar color schemes, with red propeller spinners, yellow wing bands and all-red tail surfaces.\\r\\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces. During World War II, black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws[N 1] and the American military was racially segregated, as was much of the federal government. The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to discrimination, both within and outside the army.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Tuskegee Airmen, no African-American had been a U.S. military pilot. In 1917, African-American men had tried to become aerial observers, but were rejected.[5] African-American Eugene Bullard served in the French air service during World War I, because he was not allowed to serve in an American unit. Instead, Bullard returned to infantry duty with the French.[6]\\r\\nThe racially motivated rejections of World War I African-American recruits sparked more than two decades of advocacy by African-Americans who wished to enlist and train as military aviators. The effort was led by such prominent civil rights leaders as Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, labor union leader A. Philip Randolph, and Judge William H. Hastie. Finally, on 3 April 1939, Appropriations Bill Public Law 18 was passed by Congress containing an amendment by Senator Harry H. Schwartz, designating funds for training African-American pilots. The War Department managed to put the money into funds of civilian flight schools willing to train black Americans.[5]\\r\\nWar Department tradition and policy mandated the segregation of African-Americans into separate military units staffed by white officers, as had been done previously with the 9th Cavalry, 10th Cavalry, 24th Infantry Regiment and 25th Infantry Regiment. When the appropriation of funds for aviation training created opportunities for pilot cadets, their numbers diminished the rosters of these older units.[7] In 1941, the War Department and the Army Air Corps, under pressure  three months before its transformation into the USAAF  constituted the first all-black flying unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron.[8]\\r\\nDue to the restrictive nature of selection policies, the situation did not seem promising for African-Americans since, in 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau reported there were only 124 African-American pilots in the nation.[9] The exclusionary policies failed dramatically when the Air Corps received an abundance of applications from men who qualified, even under the restrictive requirements. Many of the applicants already had participated in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, unveiled in late December 1938 (CPTP). Tuskegee University had participated since 1939.[10]\\r\\nThe U.S. Army Air Corps had established the Psychological Research Unit 1 at Maxwell Army Air Field, Montgomery, Alabama, and other units around the country for aviation cadet training, which included the identification, selection, education, and training of pilots, navigators, and bombardiers. Psychologists employed in these research studies and training programs used some of the first standardized tests to quantify IQ, dexterity and leadership qualities to select and train the best-suited personnel for the roles of bombardier, navigator, and pilot. The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units, including all-black units. At Tuskegee, this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen. The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the most able and intelligent African-American applicants were able to join.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe budding flight program at Tuskegee received a publicity boost when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt inspected it in March 1941, and flew with African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred \\"Chief\\" Anderson. Anderson, who had been flying since 1929, and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots, took his prestigious passenger on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub.[11] After landing, she cheerfully announced, \\"Well, you can fly all right.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the CPTP at Tuskegee, even though the program was already five months old. Eleanor Roosevelt used her position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of Moton Field.[12]\\r\\nOn 11 September 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron [N 2] was activated at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois.[13][14][N 3]\\r\\nA cadre of 271 enlisted men was trained in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute, beginning in July 1941; the skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible. This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee and Maxwell Fields in Alabama.[15]\\r\\nThe Tuskegee program officially began June 1941 with the 99th Pursuit Squadron at Tuskegee University.[16][17][N 4] The unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men,[19] and was backed by an entire service arm. After primary training at Moton Field, they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field, about 10 miles (16?km) to the west for conversion training onto operational types. Consequently, Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training (basic, advanced, and transition) at a single location. Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time.[20]\\r\\nBy mid-1942, over six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee, even though only two squadrons were training there.[21]\\r\\nTuskegee Army Airfield was similar to already-existing airfields reserved for training white pilots, such as Maxwell Field, only 40 miles (64?km) distant.[22] African-American contractor McKissack and McKissack, Inc. was in charge of the contract. The company's 2,000 workmen, the Alabama Works Progress Administration, and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months. The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057.[23] The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., one of only two black line officers then serving.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring training, Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison. Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee. However, he was transferred on 12 January 1942, reputedly because of his insistence that his African-American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local Caucasian civilians.[24]\\r\\nHis successor, Colonel Frederick von Kimble, then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield. Contrary to new Army regulations, Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama, a policy that was resented by the airmen.[22] Later that year, the Air Corps replaced Kimble. His replacement had been the director of instruction at Tuskegee Army Airfield, Major Noel F. Parrish.[25] Counter to the prevalent racism of the day, Parrish was fair and open-minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat.[26]\\r\\nThe strict racial segregation the U.S. Army required gave way in the face of the requirements for complex training in technical vocations. Typical of the process was the development of separate African-American flight surgeons to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen.[27] Before the development of this unit, no U.S. Army flight surgeons had been black.\\r\\nTraining of African-American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses until 1943, when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas. This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941-49. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Dr. Vance H. Marchbanks, Jr., MD, a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis.[27]\\r\\nThe accumulation of washed-out cadets at Tuskegee and the propensity of other commands to \\"dump\\" African-American personnel on the post exacerbated the difficulties of administering Tuskegee. A shortage of jobs for them made these enlisted men a drag on Tuskegee's housing and culinary departments.[28]\\r\\nTrained officers were also left idle, as the plan to shift African-American officers into command slots stalled, and white officers not only continued to hold command, but were joined by additional white officers assigned to the post. One rationale behind the non-assignment of trained African-American officers was stated by the commanding officer of the Army Air Forces, General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold: \\"Negro pilots cannot be used in our present Air Corps units since this would result in Negro officers serving over white enlisted men creating an impossible social situation.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe 99th was finally considered ready for combat duty by April 1943. It shipped out of Tuskegee on 2 April, bound for North Africa, where it would join the 33rd Fighter Group and its commander, Colonel William W. Momyer. Given little guidance from battle-experienced pilots, the 99th's first combat mission was to attack the small strategic volcanic island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea lanes for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. The air assault on the island began 30 May 1943. The 99th flew its first combat mission on 2 June.[30] The surrender of the garrison of 11,121 Italians and 78 Germans[31] due to air attack was the first of its kind.[32]\\r\\nThe 99th then moved on to Sicily and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its performance in combat.[33]\\r\\nBy the end of February 1944, more graduates were ready for combat, and the all-black 332nd Fighter Group had been sent overseas with three fighter squadrons: The 100th, 301st and 302nd.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnder the command of Colonel Davis, the squadrons were moved to mainland Italy, where the 99th Fighter Squadron, assigned to the group on May 1, 1944, joined them on June 6 at Ramitelli Airfield, in the small city of Campomarino, on the Adriatic coast. From Ramitelli, the 332nd Fighter Group escorted Fifteenth Air Force heavy strategic bombing raids into Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland and Germany.[34]\\r\\nFlying escort for heavy bombers, the 332nd earned an impressive combat record. The Allies called these airmen \\"Red Tails\\" or \\"Red-Tail Angels,\\" because of the distinctive crimson unit identification marking predominantly applied on the tail section of the unit's aircraft.[35]\\r\\nA B-25 bomb group, the 477th Bombardment Group, was forming in the U.S., but was not able to complete its training in time to see action. The 99th Fighter Squadron after its return to the United States became part of the 477th, redesignated the 477th Composite Group.[35]\\r\\nThe only black air units that saw combat during the war were the 99th Pursuit Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group. The dive-bombing and strafing missions under Lieutenant Colonel Davis, Jr. were considered to be highly successful.[36][37]\\r\\nIn May 1942, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was renamed the 99th Fighter Squadron. It earned three Distinguished Unit Citations (DUC) during World War II. The DUCs were for operations over Sicily from 30 Mayÿ11 June 1943, Monastery Hill near Cassino from 12ÿ14 May 1944, and for successfully fighting off German jet aircraft on 24 March 1945. The mission was the longest bomber escort mission of the Fifteenth Air Force throughout the war.[33][38] The 332nd flew missions in Sicily, Anzio, Normandy, the Rhineland, the Po Valley and Rome-Arno and others. Pilots of the 99th once set a record for destroying five enemy aircraft in under four minutes.[36]\\r\\nThe Tuskegee Airmen shot down three German jets in a single day.[39] On 24 March 1945, 43 P-51 Mustangs led by Colonel Benjamin O. Davis escorted B-17 bombers over 1,600 miles (2,600?km) into Germany and back. The bombers target, a massive Daimler-Benz tank factory in Berlin, was heavily defended by Luftwaffe aircraft, including propeller-driven Fw 190s, Me 163 \\"Komet\\" rocket-powered fighters, and 25 of the much more formidable Me 262s, history's first operational jet fighter. Pilots Charles Brantley, Earl Lane and Roscoe Brown all shot down German jets over Berlin that day. For the mission, the 332nd Fighter Group earned a Distinguished Unit Citation.[34]\\r\\nPilots of the 332nd Fighter Group earned 96 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Their missions took them over Italy and enemy occupied parts of central and southern Europe. Their operational aircraft were, in succession: Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft.[36]\\r\\nWith African-American fighter pilots being trained successfully, the Army Air Force now came under political pressure from the NAACP and other civil rights organizations to organize a bomber unit. There could be no defensible argument that the quota of 100 African-American pilots in training at one time,[40] or 200 per year out of a total of 60,000 American aviation cadets in annual training,[41] represented the service potential of 13 million African-Americans.[N 5]\\r\\nOn 13 May 1943, the 616th Bombardment Squadron was established as the initial subordinate squadron of the 477th Bombardment Group. The squadron was activated on 1 July 1943, only to be inactivated on 15 August 1943.[28] By September 1943, the number of washed-out cadets on base had surged to 286, with few of them working. In January 1944, the 477th Bombardment Group was reactivated. At the time, the usual training cycle for a bombardment group took three to four months.[42]\\r\\nThe 477th would eventually contain four medium bomber squadrons. Slated to comprise 1,200 officers and enlisted men, the unit would operate 60 North American B-25 Mitchell bombers.[N 6] The 477th would go on to encompass three more bomber squadronsÿthe 617th Bombardment Squadron, the 618th Bombardment Squadron, and the 619th Bombardment Squadron.[44] The 477th was anticipated to be ready for action in November 1944.[45]\\r\\nThe home field for the 477th was Selfridge Field, located outside Detroit, however, other bases would be used for various types of training courses. Twin-engine pilot training began at Tuskegee while transition to multi-engine pilot training was at Mather Field, California. Some ground crews trained at Mather before rotating to Inglewood. Gunners learned to shoot at Eglin Field, Florida. Bombers-navigators learned their trades at Hondo Army Air Field and Midland Air Field, Texas or at Roswell, New Mexico. Training of the new African-American crewmen also took place at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Scott Field, Belleville, Illinois. Once trained, the air and ground crews would be spliced into a working unit at Selfridge.[46][47]\\r\\nThe new group's first commanding officer was Colonel Robert Selway, who had also commanded the 332nd Fighter Group before it deployed for combat overseas. Like his ranking officer, Major General Frank O'Driscoll Hunter from Georgia, Selway was a racial segregationist. Hunter was blunt about it, saying such things as, \\"...racial friction will occur if colored and white pilots are trained together.\\"[citation needed] He backed Selway's violations of Army Regulation 210-10, which forbade segregation of air base facilities. They segregated base facilities so thoroughly they even drew a line in the base theater and ordered separate seating by races. When the audience sat in random patterns as part of \\"Operation Checkerboard\\", the movie was halted to make men return to segregated seating.[48] African-American officers petitioned base Commanding Officer William Boyd for access to the only officer's club on base. Lieutenant Milton Henry entered the club and personally demanded his club rights; he was court-martialed for this, and discharged.[citation needed]\\r\\nSubsequently, Colonel Boyd denied club rights to African-Americans although General Hunter stepped in and promised a separate but equal club would be built for black airmen.[49] The 477th was transferred to Godman Field, Kentucky before the club was built. They had spent five months at Selfridge but found themselves on a base a fraction of Selfridge's size, with no air-to-ground gunnery range, and deteriorating runways that were too short for B-25 landings. Colonel Selway took on the second role of commanding officer of Godman Field. In that capacity, he ceded Godman Field's officer club to African-American airmen. Caucasian officers used the whites-only clubs at nearby Fort Knox, much to the displeasure of African-American officers.[50]\\r\\nAnother irritant was a professional one for African-American officers. They observed a steady flow of white officers through the command positions of the group and squadrons; these officers stayed just long enough to be \\"promotable\\" before transferring out at their new rank. This seemed to take about four months. In an extreme example, 22-year-old Robert Mattern was promoted to captain, transferred into squadron command in the 477th days later, and left a month later as a major. He was replaced by another Caucasian officer. Meanwhile, no Tuskegee Airmen held command.[51]\\r\\nOn 15 March 1945,[52] the 477th was transferred to Freeman Field, near Seymour, Indiana. The white population of Freeman Field was 250 officers and 600 enlisted men. Superimposed on it were 400 African-American officers and 2,500 enlisted men of the 477th and its associated units. Freeman Field had a firing range, usable runways, and other amenities useful for training. African-American airmen would work in proximity with white ones; both would live in a public housing project adjacent to the base.[citation needed]\\r\\nColonel Selway turned the non-commissioned officers out of their club and turned it into a second officers club. He then classified all white personnel as cadre, and all African-Americans as trainees. One officers club became the cadre's club. The old Non-Commissioned Officers Club, promptly sarcastically dubbed \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", became the trainee's officers club. At least four of the trainees had flown combat in Europe as fighter pilots, and had about four years in service. Four others had completed training as pilots, bombardiers and navigators, and may have been the only triply qualified officers in the entire Air Corps. Several of the Tuskegee Airmen had logged over 900 flight hours by this time. Nevertheless, by Colonel Selway's fiat, they were trainees.[52][53]\\r\\nOff-base was no better; many businesses in Seymour would not serve African-Americans. A local laundry would not wash their clothes, yet willingly laundered those of captured German soldiers.[52]\\r\\nIn early April 1945, the 118th Base Unit transferred in from Godman Field; its African-American personnel held orders that specified they were base cadre, not trainees. On 5 April, officers of the 477th peaceably tried to enter the whites-only Officer's Club. Selway had been tipped off by a phone call, and had the assistant provost marshal and base billeting manager stationed at the door to refuse the 477th officers entry. The latter, a major, ordered them to leave, and took their names as a means of arresting them when they refused. It was the beginning of the Freeman Field Mutiny.[54]\\r\\nIn the wake of the Freeman Field Mutiny, the 616th and 619th were disbanded and the returned 99th Fighter Squadron assigned to the 477th on 22 June 1945; it was re-designated the 477th Composite Group as a result. On 1 July 1945, Colonel Robert Selway was relieved of the Group's command; he was replaced by Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. A complete sweep of Selway's white staff followed, with all vacated jobs filled by African-American officers. The war ended before the 477th Composite Group could get into action. The 618th Bombardment Squadron was disbanded on October 8, 1945. On 13 March 1946, the two-squadron group, supported by the 602nd Engineer Squadron (later renamed 602nd Air Engineer Squadron), the 118th Base Unit, and a band, moved to its final station, Lockbourne Field. The 617th Bombardment Squadron and the 99th Fighter Squadron disbanded on July 1, 1947, ending the 477th Composite Group. It would be reorganized as the 332nd Fighter Wing.[55][56]\\r\\nIn all, 992 pilots were trained in Tuskegee from 1941-46. 355 were deployed overseas, and 84 lost their lives in accidents or combat.[38][57] The toll included 68 pilots killed in action or accidents, 12 killed in training and non-combat missions[58] and 32 captured as prisoners of war.[59][60]\\r\\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were credited by higher commands with the following accomplishments:\\r\\nAwards and decorations included:\\r\\nOn 24 March 1945, during the war, the Chicago Defender said that no bomber escorted by the Tuskegee Airmen had ever been lost to enemy fire, under the headline: \\"332nd Flies Its 200th Mission Without Loss\\";[67] the article was based on information supplied by the 15th Air Force.[68][69]\\r\\nThis statement was repeated for many years, and not publicly challenged, partly because the mission reports were classified for a number of years after the war. In 2004, William Holton, who was serving as the historian of the Tuskegee Airmen Incorporated, conducted research into wartime action reports.[70]\\r\\nAlan Gropman, a professor at the National Defense University, disputed the initial refutations of the no-loss myth, and said he researched more than 200 Tuskegee Airmen mission reports and found no bombers were lost to enemy fighters.[70] Dr. Daniel Haulman of the Air Force Historical Research Agency conducted a reassessment of the history of the unit in 2006 and early 2007. His subsequent report, based on after-mission reports filed by both the bomber units and Tuskegee fighter groups, as well as missing air crew records and witness testimony, documented 25 bombers shot down by enemy fighter aircraft while being escorted by the Tuskegee Airmen.[71]\\r\\nIn a subsequent article, \\"The Tuskegee Airmen and the Never Lost a Bomber Myth,\\" published in the Alabama Review and also by New South Books as an e-book, and included in a more comprehensive study regarding misconceptions about the Tuskegee Airmen released by AFHRA in July 2013, Haulman documented 27 bombers shot down by enemy aircraft while those bombers were being escorted by the 332nd Fighter Group. This total included 15 B-17s of the 483rd Bombardment Group shot down during a particularly savage air battle with an estimated 300 German fighters on 18 July 1944 that also resulted in nine kill credits and the award of five Distinguished Flying Crosses to members of the 332nd.[72]\\r\\nOf the 179 bomber escort missions the 332nd Fighter Group flew for the Fifteenth Air Force, the group encountered enemy aircraft on 35 of those missions and lost bombers to enemy aircraft on only seven, and the total number of bombers lost was 27. By comparison, the average number of bombers lost by the other P-51 fighter groups of the Fifteenth Air Force during the same period was 46.[73]\\r\\nA number of examples of the fighter group's losses exist in the historical record. A mission report states that on 26 July 1944: \\"1 B-24 seen spiraling out of formation in T/A [target area] after attack by E/A [enemy aircraft]. No chutes seen to open.\\" The Distinguished Flying Cross citation awarded to Colonel Benjamin O. Davis for the mission on 9 June 1944 noted that he \\"so skillfully disposed his squadrons that in spite of the large number of enemy fighters, the bomber formation suffered only a few losses.\\"[74]\\r\\nWilliam Holloman was reported by the Times as saying his review of records confirmed bombers had been lost. Holloman was a member of Tuskegee Airmen Inc., a group of surviving Tuskegee pilots and their supporters, who also taught Black Studies at the University of Washington and chaired the Airmen's history committee.[70] According to the 28 March 2007 Air Force report, some bombers under 332nd Fighter Group escort protection were even shot down on the day the Chicago Defender article was published.[68] The mission reports, however, do credit the group for not losing a bomber on an escort mission for a six-month period between September 1944 and March 1945, albeit when Luftwaffe contacts were far fewer than earlier.[75]\\r\\nContrary to negative predictions from some quarters, Tuskegee Airmen were some of the best pilots in the U.S. Army Air Forces due to a combination of pre-war experience and the personal drive of those accepted for training. Nevertheless, the Tuskegee Airmen continued to have to fight racism. Their combat record did much to quiet those directly involved with the group, but other units continued to harass these airmen.[76] In 1949, the 332nd entered the annual U. S. Continental Gunnery Meet in Las Vegas, Nevada. The competition included shooting aerial targets, shooting targets on the ground and dropping bombs on targets. Flying the long range Republic P-47N Thunderbolt (built for the long range escort mission in the Pacific theatre of World War II), the 332nd Fighter Wing took first place in the conventional fighter class. The pilots were Capt. Alva Temple, Lts. Harry Stewart, James Harvey III and Herbert Alexander. Lt. Harvey said, \\"We had a perfect score. Three missions, two bombs per plane. We didn't guess at anything, we were good.\\"[77] They received congratulations from the Governor of Ohio, and Air Force commanders across the nation.[78]\\r\\nAfter segregation in the military was ended in 1948 by President Harry S. Truman with Executive Order 9981, the veteran Tuskegee Airmen now found themselves in high demand throughout the newly formed United States Air Force. Some taught in civilian flight schools, such as the black-owned Columbia Air Center in Maryland.[79] On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter 35.3 was published, which mandated that black Airmen be screened for reassignment to formerly all-white units according to qualifications.[citation needed]\\r\\nTuskegee Airmen were instrumental in postwar developments in aviation. Edward A. Gibbs was a civilian flight instructor in the U.S. Aviation Cadet Program at Tuskegee during its inception.[80] He later became the founder of Negro Airmen International, an association joined by many airmen. USAF General Daniel \\"Chappie\\" James Jr. (then Lt.) was an instructor of the 99th Pursuit Squadron, later a fighter pilot in Europe. In 1975, he became the first African-American to reach the rank of four-star general.[81] Post-war commander of the 99th Squadron Marion Rodgers went on to work in communications for NORAD and as a program developer for the Apollo 13 project.[82]\\r\\nIn 2005, seven Tuskegee Airmen, including Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Carter, Colonel Charles McGee, group historian Ted Johnson, and Lieutenant Colonel Lee Archer, flew to Balad, Iraq, to speak to active duty airmen serving in the current incarnation of the 332nd, which was reactivated as the 332nd Air Expeditionary Group in 1998 and made part of the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing. \\"This group represents the linkage between the 'greatest generation' of airmen and the 'latest generation' of airmen,\\" said Lt. Gen. Walter E. Buchanan III, commander of the Ninth Air Force and US Central Command Air Forces.[83]\\r\\nNo one knows how many of the original 996 pilots and about 16,000 ground personnel are still alive.[84] Surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen participate annually in the Tuskegee Airmen Convention, which is hosted by Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.[85]\\r\\nWillie Rogers, the last surviving member of the original Tuskegee Airmen, died at the age of 101 on 18 November 2016 in St. Petersburg, Florida following a stroke. Rogers was drafted into the Army in 1942 and was part of the 100th Air Engineer Squad. Rogers also served with the Red Tail Angels. He was wounded in action, shot in the stomach and leg by German soldiers, during a mission in Italy in January 1943.[86] In 2007, President George W. Bush awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal. Rev. Irby said Rogers was a \\"passionate oral historian.\\" [87]\\r\\nOn 29 March 2007, the Tuskegee Airmen were collectively awarded a Congressional Gold Medal[88] at a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol rotunda.[89][90][91] The medal is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution.[68] The airfield where the airmen trained is now the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site.[92]\\r\\nThurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice, got his start defending Tuskegee bomber trainees. The 477th Bombardment Group was formed in 1944 to extend the so-called \\"Tuskegee experiment\\" by allowing black aviators to serve on bomber crews. The aim was to send pilotsmany of them veterans of the original Tuskegee fighter groupback to the States for training on B-25 bombers. While in Indiana, some of the African-American officers were arrested and charged with mutiny after entering an all-white officers club. Marshall, then a young lawyer, represented the 100 black officers who had landed in jail as a result of the confrontation. The men were soon released (although one was later convicted of violent conduct and fined).[93]\\r\\nOther members of the Tuskegee Airmen have made contributions in the world of business. Eugene Winslow founded Afro-Am Publishing in Chicago, Illinois, which published Great Negroes Past and Present in 1963.[94]\\r\\nDaniel \\"Chappie\\" James Jr. started his career in the early 1940s at Tuskegee, joining the Army Air Corps in July 1943. After the war ended, James stayed in what became the Air Force and flew missions in both Korea and Vietnam. In 1969, James was put in command of Wheelus Air Base outside of Tripoli.[93]\\r\\nThree Tuskegee airmen went on to become generals. For keeping his cool in the face of Qaddafi's troops, James was appointed a brigadier general by President Nixon. However, he was not the only graduate of the \\"Tuskegee experiment\\" to make flag rank. James followed in the footsteps of Benjamin O. Davis Jr., the original commander of the 332nd Fighter Group and the first black general in the U.S. Air Force. Another Tuskegee aviator, Lucius Theus, retired a major general after dedicating most of his 36-year career in the Air Force to improving the military's bureaucracy, helping to implement a direct deposit system for service members.[93]\\r\\nIn 2006, California Congressman Adam Schiff and Missouri Congressman William Lacy Clay, Jr., led the initiative to create a commemorative postage stamp to honor the Tuskegee Airmen.[95]\\r\\nThe 99th Flying Training Squadron flies T-1A Jayhawks and, in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen, painted the tops of the tails of their aircraft red. On August 1, 2008, Camp Creek Parkway, a portion of State Route 6 in south Fulton County and in the City of East Point near Atlanta, Georgia, was officially renamed in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen. The road is a highway that serves as the main artery into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.[96]\\r\\nThe Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh presented an award to several Western Pennsylvania Tuskegee veterans, as well as suburban Sewickley, Pennsylvania dedicated a memorial to the seven from that municipality.[97] An exhibit was established at Pittsburgh International Airport in Concourse A.[98]\\r\\nOn 9 December 2008, the Tuskegee Airmen were invited to attend the inauguration of Barack Obama, the first African-American elected as President. Retired Lt. William Broadwater, 82, of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, a Tuskegee Airman, summed up the feeling. \\"The culmination of our efforts and others was this great prize we were given on Nov. 4. Now we feel like we've completed our mission.\\"[99][100] More than 180 airmen attended the 20 January 2009 inauguration.[101]\\r\\nIn July 2009, 15-year-old Kimberly Anyadike became the youngest female African-American pilot to complete a transcontinental flight across the United States. She cited the Tuskegee Airmen as one of her biggest inspirations, and was accompanied on her trip by 87-year-old former Tuskegee Airman Levi Thornhill.[102]\\r\\nThe Tuskegee Airmen Memorial was erected at Walterboro Army Airfield, South Carolina, in honor of the Tuskegee Airmen, their instructors, and ground support personnel who trained at the Walterboro Army Airfield during World War II.[citation needed] In the 2010 Rose Parade, the city of West Covina, California paid tribute to the \\"service and commitment of the Tuskegee Airmen\\" with a float, entitled \\"Tuskegee AirmenA Cut Above\\", which featured a large bald eagle, two replica World War II \\"Redtail\\" fighter aircraft and historical images of some of the airmen who served. The float won the mayor's trophy as the most outstanding city entrynational or international.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn June 1998, the Ohio Army and Air National guard opened a jointly operated dining hall. They dedicated the new dining facility called the \\"Red Tail Dining Facility\\" to the Tuskegee Airmen. The facility is operated at the Rickenbacker ANG base outside of Columbus Ohio.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn January 2012, MTA Regional Bus Operations officially changed the name of its 100th Street depot in New York City to the Tuskegee Airmen Depot. In 2012, George Lucas produced Red Tails, a film based on the experiences of the Tuskegee Airmen.[103]\\r\\nIn 2012, Aldine Independent School District in Harris County, Texas named Benjamin O. Davis High School in honor of Benjamin O. Davis Jr.[104]\\r\\nThere is a mural depicting the Tuskegee Airmen and their contributions at 39th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[106]\\r\\nPatch of the 99th Fighter Squadron\\r\\nPatch of the 100th Fighter Squadron\\r\\nPatch of the 301st Fighter Squadron\\r\\nPatch of the 302d Fighter Squadron","input":"What wars did the tuskegee airmen fight in?"},{"output":"4,726","context":"","input":"How many 4-year colleges and universities in the u.s?"},{"output":"Dennis Michael Locorriere","context":"Dennis Michael Locorriere (born June 13, 1949; Union City, New Jersey, United States) is the American former lead vocalist and guitarist of the soft rock group Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show, later Dr. Hook.[1] He continues as a solo artist, session musician and songwriter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocorriere, as a founding member of Dr. Hook, was the recipient of more than 60 gold and platinum albums, gaining No.?1 chart status in more than 42 countries.[citation needed] He is also a songwriter, whose songs having been recorded by Bob Dylan, Crystal Gayle, BJ Thomas, Helen Reddy, Willie Nelson, Southside Johnny and by Jerry Lee Lewis, on his 2006 release, Last Man Standing.[citation needed]\\r\\nLocorriere's company retains the rights to the trademark name, Dr. Hook, although it is licensed to Ray Sawyer for touring purposes.

November 20, 1620?ÿ July 20, 1704) was the first baby boy born on the Mayflower in the harbor of Massachusetts, the second baby born on the Mayflower's historic voyage, and the first known English child born to the Pilgrims in America.[1] His parents, William White and his pregnant wife Susanna, with their son Resolved White and two servants, came on the Pilgrim ship Mayflower in 1620. Peregrine White was born while the Mayflower lay at anchor in the harbor at Cape Cod. In later life he became a person of note in Plymouth Colony, active in both military and government affairs.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeregrine White[5] was the second son of Mayflower pilgrim William White and his wife Susanna Winslow White. His mother Susanna was pregnant during the Mayflower voyage and gave birth to Peregrine in late November 1620 while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod, now Provincetown Harbor.[2][4][6]\\r\\nThe Whites are believed to have boarded the Mayflower as part of the London merchant group, and not as members of the Leiden Holland religious movement. Evidence of the William White family coming to the Mayflower from England and not Holland comes from William Bradfords Mayflower passenger list which has \\"Mr. William White\\" in his section for London merchants along with Mr. Christopher Martin, Mr. William Mullins, Mr. Stephen Hopkins, Mr. Richard Warren and John Billington. It is believed that if William White had been a member of the Leiden congregation, his name would have appeared in Bradfords work for that section, but it does not. There is no evidence to associate William White and his family with Leiden, Holland. And regarding the various White family ancestries which erroneously place the William White family in them, the Mayflower Society states that Little is known about William White.[4][7]\\r\\nThe White family, as recalled by William Bradford in 1651: Mr. William White, and Susana, his wife, and one son, called Resolved, and one borne a ship-bord, called Peregrine; and *2* servants, named William Holbeck and Edward Thomson.[8]\\r\\nThe Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ships timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.[9]\\r\\nAt some point along the journey, the first baby was born on the Mayflower, Oceanus Hopkins, to the passengers Stephen and Elizabeth Hopkins.\\r\\nOn November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.[9][10][11]\\r\\nPeregrine Whites father William White, died on February 21, 1621. With her husband's death, Susanna, with her newborn son Peregrine and five-year-old Resolved, became the only surviving widow out of the many families who perished that first winter. On May 12, 1621 Peregrines mother Susanna married widower Edward Winslow, a Mayflower and later a Plymouth colony notable with whom she had five children, one of whom was Josiah Winslow, future Plymouth governor.[2][4][12][13]\\r\\nIn the 1627 Division of Cattle, both Resolved (sic) and his brother Peregrine were listed in the Third Lot under Capt. Standish in the family of Edward Winslow, his wife Susanna and their sons Edward and John Winslow.[2][14]\\r\\nIn 1636, the family, now numbering 6 - Edward and Susanna, Resolved and Peregrine White, and the two children born to Edward and Susanna, Josias and Elizabeth Winslow - moved to the new settlement of Marshfield, north of Plymouth.[15]\\r\\nPeregrine served in the militia at age 16 and continued to serve, first as a lieutenant and then a captain. He was also a farmer. At some point he also served his community as a representative to the General Court.[16]\\r\\nOn October 23, 1643 Peregrine White at Marshfield sold to Mannasses Kempton of Plymouth, land at Eel River given to him the previous year by his stepfather Edward Winslow.[17]\\r\\nAt the court on March 6, 1648/9, Peregrine White and Sarah his wife, both of Marshfield, were presented (fined) for fornication before marriage. Since records show their first child, Daniel, was born in 1649, they seemingly married after becoming pregnant.[17][18]\\r\\nPeregrine's in-laws, the Bassets, had a great deal of land in Marshfield and Peregrine and Sarah moved there, eventually buying several adjacent pieces of property as the years progressed.[16]\\r\\nOn June 3, 1651, Lt. Peregrine White was admitted as a Freeman.[17]\\r\\nOn June 3, 1652 William Bassett Sr. of Duxburrow gave his son-in-law Lt. Peregrine White 40 acres of upland.[15]\\r\\nIn 1655 he was granted land as the first of the English that was borne in these ptes.[19]\\r\\nOn June 16, 1656 as written, William Bassett Sr. of Duxborrow (sic), now living at Bridgewater, gave his lands in Scituate to his sons Peregrine White and Nathaniel Bassett.[17]\\r\\nOn October 2, 1658 he was chosen to the council of war.[17]\\r\\nOn June 3, 1662 Peregrine was chosen deputy for Marshfield.[17]\\r\\nOn March 4, 1673/4 Lt. Peregrine White was granted 100 acres at Titicut.[20][21]\\r\\nOn August 19, 1674 Peregrine White of Marshfield deeded son Daniel White, in consideration of his intended marriage, various buildings and lands in Marshfield from the time of his death, except if he died before his wife Sarah and Daniel was to pay monies to sister Sarah and Mercy when they became or married.[21]\\r\\nOn May 22, 1696 Capt. Peregrine White the first born Child of New England born November 1620 was admitted into the Marshfield Church in his 78th year. At age 78, Peregrine officially joined the Marshfield church.[21]\\r\\nPeregrine White married before March 6, 1648/9 Sarah Bassett, daughter of William and Elizabeth/Elisabeth Bassett.[22] William Bassett came to Plymouth in 1621 on the Fortune as a single man, but by the 1623 division was allotted two acres showing he had married before that date. Bassetts name as Wm Bassett, Sen appears on the 1643 Able to Bear Arms list for Duxborrow (sic). William Bassett became a Plymouth Colony person of historic note.[4][23][24]\\r\\nSarah Bassett was born in Plymouth c.1630 and died in Marshfield January 22, 1711. They had seven children between c.1649 and c.1670.[15][25]\\r\\nChildren of Peregrine White and his wife Sarah:\\r\\nIn 1704 - The will of Peregrine White (which is owned by and displayed at Pilgrim Hall in Plymouth), dated July 14, 1704 and proved August 14 of the same year states: Peregrine White of Marshfield..Being aged and under many Weaknesses and Bodily Infirmities devised to his wife Sarah everything not otherwise disposed of by the will to his eldest son Daniel personal items and land .. as well as various personal items and land to daughters Sarah and Mercy and sons Jonathan and Peregrine. His will was signed with the initials PW The mark of Peregrine White who was then aged almost 84 years.[33][34]\\r\\nPeregrine White died on July 20, 1704 in Marshfield, Massachusetts at age 83 years and 8 months. He was buried in Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts. His wife Sarah died on January 22, 1711 and was also buried in Winslow Cemetery. Additionally, Peregrines elder brother Resolved White, his wife Judith and their mother Susanna were all buried in Winslow Cemetery.

Hamburgers were later added to the menu at a cost of ten cents with all-you-can-drink orange juice at five cents. In 1940, Maurice and Richard (\\"Mac\\" and \\"Dick\\") moved the entire building 40 miles (64?km) east, to West 14th and 1398 North E Streets in San Bernardino, California. The restaurant was renamed \\"McDonald's Bar-B-Que\\" and had 25 menu items, mostly barbecue.\\r\\nIn October 1948, after the McDonald brothers realized that most of their profits came from selling hamburgers, they closed down their successful carhop drive-in to establish a streamlined system with a simple menu which consisted of only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, soft drinks, and apple pie.[3] After the first year, potato chips and pie were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes. The carhops were eliminated, making the new restaurant a self-service operation. Richard and Maurice took great care in setting up their kitchen like an assembly line to ensure maximum efficiency. The restaurant's name was changed again, this time to simply \\"McDonald's,\\" and reopened on December 12, 1948.\\r\\nIn April 1952, the brothers decided they needed an entirely new building in order to achieve two goals: further efficiency improvements, and a more eye-catching appearance. They collected recommendations for an architect and interviewed at least four, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana.[1] The brothers and Meston worked together closely in the design of their new building. They achieved the extra efficiencies they needed by, among other things, drawing the actual measurements of every piece of equipment in chalk on a tennis court behind the McDonald house (with Meston's assistant Charles Fish).[4] The new restaurant's design achieved a high level of noticeability thanks to gleaming surfaces of red and white ceramic tile, stainless steel, brightly colored sheet metal, and glass; pulsing red, white, yellow, and green neon; and two 25-foot yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called \\"golden arches\\" even at the design stage. A third, smaller arch sign at the roadside hosted a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon. Further marketing techniques were implemented to change McDonald's from a sit down restaurant to a fast food chain. They used such things as turning off the heating to prevent people wanting to stay so long, fixed and angled seating so the customer would sit over their food promoting them to eat faster, spreading the seats further apart so being less of a sociable place to dine in, and giving their customers branded cone shaped cups forcing them to hold their drink whilst eating which would speed up the eating process. Many other companies followed McDonald's strategies to turn their own restaurants into fast food establishments including Burger King, White Castle and Subway.[1]\\r\\nIn late 1953, with only a rendering of Meston's design in hand, the brothers began seeking franchisees.[1] Their first franchisee was Neil Fox, a distributor for General Petroleum Corporation. Fox's stand, the first with Meston's golden arches design, opened in May 1953 at 4050 North Central Avenue at Indian School Road in Phoenix, Arizona. Their second franchisee was the team of Fox's brother-in-law Roger Williams and Burdette \\"Bud\\" Landon, both of whom also worked for General Petroleum. Williams and Landon opened their stand on 18 August 1953 at 10207 Lakewood Boulevard in Downey, California. The Downey stand has the distinction of being the oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant.[5] The Downey stand was never required to comply with the McDonald's Corporation's remodeling and updating requests over the years because it was franchised not by the McDonald's Corporation, but by the McDonald brothers themselves to Williams and Landon.\\r\\nIn 1954, Ray Kroc, a seller of Prince Castle brand Multimixer milkshake machines, learned that the McDonald brothers were using eight of his machines in their San Bernardino restaurant. His curiosity was piqued, and he went to take a look at the restaurant. He was joined by good friend Charles Lewis who had suggested to Kroc several improvements to the McDonald's burger recipe.\\r\\nBelieving the McDonald's formula was a ticket to success, Kroc suggested they franchise their restaurants throughout the country. The brothers were skeptical, however, that the self-service approach could succeed in colder, rainier climates; furthermore, their thriving business in San Bernardino, and franchises already operating or planned, made them reluctant to risk a national venture.[1] Kroc offered to take the major responsibility for setting up the new franchises elsewhere. He returned to his home outside of Chicago with rights to set up McDonald's restaurants throughout the country, except in a handful of territories in California and Arizona already licensed by the McDonald brothers. The brothers were to receive one-half of one percent of gross sales.[1] Kroc's first McDonald's restaurant opened on April 15, 1955, at 400 North Lee Street in Des Plaines, Illinois, near Chicago. The Des Plaines interior and exterior was painted by master painter Eugene Wright, who owned Wright's Decorating Service. Eugene was asked to come up with a color scheme and he chose yellow and white, with dark brown and red being secondary trim colors. Those colors would go on to become the colors of all McDonald's franchises. (Recognizing its historic and nostalgic value, in 1990 the McDonald's Corporation acquired the stand and rehabilitated it to a modern but nearly original condition, and then built an adjacent museum and gift shop to commemorate the site.)\\r\\n Once the Des Plaines restaurant had become operational, Kroc sought franchisees for his McDonald's chain. The first snag came quickly. In 1956 he discovered that the McDonald brothers had licensed the franchise rights for Cook County, Illinois to the Frejlach Ice Cream Company. Kroc was incensed that the McDonald's had not informed him of this arrangement. He purchased the rights back for $25,000, five times what the Frejlacks had originally paid, and pressed forward. McDonald's grew slowly for its first three years. By 1958, there were 34 restaurants. In 1959, however, Kroc opened 68 new restaurants, bringing the total to 102 locations.\\r\\nIn 1960, the McDonald's advertising campaign \\"Look for the Golden Arches\\" gave sales a big boost. Kroc believed that advertising was an investment that would in the end come back many times over, and advertising has always played a key role in the development of the McDonald's Corporation. Indeed, McDonald's ads have been some of the most identifiable over the years. In 1962, McDonald's introduced its now world-famous Golden Arches logo. A year later, the company sold its millionth hamburger and introduced Ronald McDonald, a red-haired clown designed to appeal to children.\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, McDonald's really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization and the interstate highway system contributed heavily to McDonald's success. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million, aiming at making McDonald's the number one fast-food chain in the country.\\r\\nOn May 3, 1960 Kroc assisted Christopher Boulos in opening a McDonald's franchise in DeKalb, Illinois. By 1965, the McDonald's at 805 W. Lincoln Highway sold over 4 million burgers and 1 million pounds of fries. Boulos was the first Greek-American McDonald's franchise operator.[6]\\r\\nIn 1965, McDonald's Corporation went public. Common shares were offered at $22.50 per share. By the end of the first day's trading, the price had risen to $30. A block of 100 shares purchased for $2,250 in 1965 was worth, after 12 stock splits (increasing the number of shares to 74,360), over $5.7 million as of year-end market close on December 31, 2010. In 1980, McDonald's Corporation became one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\\r\\nMcDonald's success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company's skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1962, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, billed as \\"the fish that catches people\\", was introduced in McDonald's restaurants.[7] The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a \\"hulaburger\\", had flopped (both it and the Filet-O-Fish were developed in Catholic neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on Fridays and during Lent). The market was not quite ready for Kroc's taste; the hulaburger's tenure on the McDonald's menu board was short. In 1968 the now legendary Big Mac made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald's sold its five billionth hamburger. Two years later, as it launched the \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\" advertising campaign, McDonald's restaurants had reached all 50 states.\\r\\nIn 1968, McDonald's opened its 1,000th restaurant, and Fred L. Turner became the company's president and chief administrative officer. Kroc became chairman and remained CEO until 1973. Turner had originally intended to open a McDonald's franchise, but when he had problems with his backers over a location, he went to work as a grillman for Kroc in 1956. As operations vice president, Turner helped new franchisees get their stores up and running. He was constantly looking for new ways to perfect the McDonald's system, experimenting, for example, to determine the maximum number of hamburger patties one could stack in a box without squashing them and pointing out that seconds could be saved if McDonald's used buns that were presliced all the way through and were not stuck together in the package. Such attention to detail was one reason for the company's extraordinary success.\\r\\nBy the late 1960s, many of the candy-striped Golden Arches stores had been modified with enclosed walk-up order areas and limited indoor seating. In June 1969, McDonald's introduced a new \\"mansard roof\\" building design featuring indoor seating. The natural brick and cedar shake look mansards were a response to critics who berated McDonald's architecture as too garish. It became the standard for McDonald's restaurants, and franchise holders were ultimately required to demolish older restaurants and replace them with the new design. The first McDonald's restaurant using the \\"mansard roof\\" design opened that same year in the Chicago suburb of Matteson.\\r\\nMcDonald's spectacular growth continued in the 1970s. Americans were more on-the-go than ever, and fast service was a priority. In 1972, the company passed $1 billion in annual sales. By 1976, McDonald's had served 20 billion hamburgers, and system wide sales exceeded $3 billion.\\r\\nThe company pioneered breakfast fast food with the introduction of the Egg McMuffin in 1972 when market research indicated that a quick breakfast would be welcomed by consumers. Five years later McDonald's added a full breakfast line to the menu, and by 1987 one-fourth of all breakfasts eaten out in the United States came from McDonald's restaurants. In test market locations, such as New York City, McDonald's added a full breakfast line to its menus in 1975.\\r\\nKroc was a firm believer in giving \\"something back into the community where you do business\\". In 1974 McDonald's acted upon that philosophy in an original way by opening the first Ronald McDonald House, in Philadelphia, to provide a \\"home away from home\\" for the families of children in nearby hospitals. Twelve years after this first house opened, 100 similar Ronald McDonald Houses were in operation across the United States.\\r\\nThere was some skepticism in the company's phenomenal growth internationally. When Wally and Hugh Morris approached the corporation in 1974 to bring McDonald's into New Zealand, they were firmly shunned by Kroc, citing a visit to the country and saying \\"There aren't any people... I never met a more dead-than-alive hole in my life.\\" Persistence by the brothers eventually led to their request being granted in May 1975. They managed to negotiate a deal with the corporation by selling New Zealand cheese to the US to offset the high costs of importing plant equipment. The first New Zealand restaurant opened in June 1976 at Porirua, near Wellington, to much more success than the corporation predicted.[8]\\r\\nIn 1975, McDonald's opened its first drive-thru window in Sierra Vista, Arizona, following Wendy's lead. This service gave Americans a fast, convenient way to procure a quick meal. The company's goal was to provide service in 50 seconds or less. Drive-thru sales eventually accounted for more than half of McDonald's systemwide sales. Meantime, the Happy Meal, a combo meal for children featuring a toy, was added to the menu in 1979. A period of aggressive advertising campaigns and price slashing in the early 1980s became known as the \\"burger wars\\". Burger King suggested to customers: \\"have it your way\\"; Wendy's offered itself as the \\"fresh alternative\\" and launched their \\"Where's the beef?\\" campaign. McDonald's sales and market still predominated, however.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, a period of substantial expansion, McDonald's further diversified its menu to suit changing consumer tastes. The company introduced the McChicken in 1980; it proved to be a sales disappointment, and was replaced with Chicken McNuggets a year later (having originally been invented by Rene Arend in 1979). In 1985, ready-to-eat salads were introduced. Efficiency, combined with an expanded menu, continued to draw customers. McDonald's began to focus on urban centers and introduced new architectural styles.\\r\\nThe first McDonald's Express locations opened in 1991. These are smaller-scale prototypes, usually constructed in prefabricated buildings or urban storefronts, that do not feature certain menu items such as milkshakes and Quarter Pounders.[9]\\r\\nIn 1992 Michael R. Quinlan became president of McDonald's Corporation, and Fred L. Turner became chairman. Quinlan, who took over as CEO in 1987, had started at McDonald's in the mail room in 1963, and gradually worked his way up. In his first year as CEO, the company opened 600 new restaurants.\\r\\nBy 1991, 37 percent of system-wide sales came from restaurants outside the United States. McDonald's opened its first foreign restaurant in British Columbia, Canada, in 1967. By the early 1990s the company had established itself in 58 foreign countries, and operated more than 3,600 restaurants outside the United States, through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and franchise agreements. Its strongest foreign markets were Japan, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and France.\\r\\nIn the mid-1980s, McDonald's, like other traditional employers of teenagers, was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States. The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce. Focusing on off-site training, it opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received \\"Bachelor of Hamburgerology\\" degrees from the 80-acre (320,000?m2) Oak Brook, Illinois, facility. The corporation opened a Hamburger University in Tokyo in 1971, in Munich in 1975, and in London in 1982.\\r\\nBraille menus were first introduced in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992, combination Braille and picture menus were reintroduced to accommodate those with vision, speech, or hearing impairments.\\r\\nClamshell grills, which cooked both sides of a hamburger simultaneously, were tested. New locations such as hospitals and military bases were tapped as sites for new restaurants. In response to the increase in microwave oven usage, McDonald's, whose name is the single most advertised brand name in the world, stepped up advertising and promotional expenditures stressing that its taste was superior to quick-packaged foods.\\r\\nThe first McDonald's in Mainland China opened in Dongmen, Shenzhen in October 1990.[10]\\r\\nMcRecycle USA began in 1990 and included a commitment to purchase at least $100 million worth of recycled products annually for use in construction, remodeling, and equipping restaurants. Chairs, table bases, table tops, eating counters, table columns, waste receptacles, corrugated cartons, packaging, and washroom tissue were all made from recycled products. McDonald's worked with the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund to develop a comprehensive solid waste reduction program. Wrapping burgers in paper rather than plastic led to a 90 percent reduction in the wrapping material waste stream.\\r\\nIt took McDonald's 33 years to open its first 10,000 restaurants. The 10,000th unit opened in April 1988. Incredibly, the company reached the 20,000-restaurant mark in only eight more years, in mid-1996. By the end of 1997 the total had surpassed 23,000, and by that time McDonald's was opening 2,000 new restaurants each year, an average of five every day.\\r\\nMuch of the growth of the 1990s came outside the US, with international units increasing from about 3,600 in 1991 to more than 11,000 by 1998. The number of countries with McDonald's outlets nearly doubled from 59 in 1991 to 114 in late 1998. In 1993, a new region was added to the empire when the first McDonald's in the Middle East opened in Tel Aviv, Israel. As the company entered new markets, it showed increasing flexibility with respect to local food preferences and customs. In Israel, for example, the first kosher McDonald's opened in a Jerusalem suburb in 1995. In Arab countries the restaurant chain used \\"Halal\\" menus, which complied with Islamic laws for food preparation. In 1996 McDonald's entered India for the first time, where it offered a Big Mac made with lamb called the Maharaja Mac. That same year the first McSki-Thru opened in Lindvallen, Sweden.\\r\\nOverall, the company derived increasing percentages of its revenue and income from outside the US. In 1992 about two-thirds of systemwide sales came from U.S. McDonald's, but by 1997 that figure was down to about 51 percent. Similarly, the operating income numbers showed a reduction from about 60 percent of sales derived from the US in 1992 to 42.5 percent in 1997.\\r\\nIn the US, the number of units grew from 9,000 in 1991 to 12,500 in 1997, an increase of about 40 percent. Although the additional units increased market share in some markets, a number of franchisees complained that new units were cannibalizing sales from existing ones. Same-store sales for outlets open for more than one year were flat in the mid-1990s, a reflection of both the greater number of units and the mature nature of the U.S. market.\\r\\nThe company made several notable blunders in the US in the 1990s which hurt stateside profits. The McLean Deluxe sandwich, which featured a 91 percent fat-free beef patty, was introduced in 1991, never really caught on, and was dropped from the menu in February 1996 to make room for the Arch Deluxe, itself an underperforming product. The \\"grown-up\\" (and pricey) Arch Deluxe sandwich was launched in May 1996 and the Deluxe Line was launched in September 1996 in a $200 million campaign to gain the business of more adults, but were bombs. The following spring brought a 55-cent Big Mac promotion, which many customers either rejected outright or were confused by because the burgers had to be purchased with full-priced fries and a drink. The promotion embittered still more franchisees, whose complaints led to its withdrawal. In July 1997 McDonald's fired its main ad agency, Leo Burnett, a 15-year McDonald's partner after the nostalgic \\"My McDonald's\\" campaign proved a failure. Several other 1990s-debuted menu items, including fried chicken, pasta, fajitas, and pizza failed as well. A seemingly weakened McDonald's was the object of a Burger King offensive when the rival fast-food maker launched the Big King sandwich, a Big Mac clone. Meanwhile, internal taste tests revealed that customers preferred the fare at Wendy's and Burger King.\\r\\nIn response to these difficulties, McDonald's drastically cut back on its U.S. expansion. In contrast to the 1,130 units opened in 1995, only about 400 new McDonald's were built in 1997. Plans to open hundreds of smaller restaurants in Wal-Marts and gasoline stations were abandoned because test sites did not meet targeted goals. Reacting to complaints from franchisees about poor communication with the corporation and excess bureaucracy, the head of McDonald's U.S.A. (Jack M. Greenberg, who had assumed the position in October 1996) reorganized the unit into five autonomous geographic divisions. The aim was to bring management and decision-making closer to franchisees and customers.\\r\\nOn the marketing side, McDonald's scored big in 1996 and 1997 with a Teenie Beanie Baby promotion in which about 80 million of the toys/collectibles were gobbled up virtually overnight. The chain received some bad publicity, however, when it was discovered that a number of customers purchased Happy Meals just to get the toys and threw the food away. For a similar spring 1998 Teenie Beanie giveaway, the company altered the promotion to allow patrons to buy menu items other than kids' meals. McDonald's also began to benefit from a seven years global marketing alliance signed with Disney/Pixar in 1998. Initial Disney/Pixar movies promoted by McDonald's included A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles. Perhaps the most important marketing move came in the later months of 1997 when McDonald's named DDB Needham as its new lead ad agency. Needham had been the company's agency in the 1970s and was responsible for the hugely successful \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\" campaign. Late in 1997, McDonald's launched the Needham-designed \\"Did Somebody Say McDonald's?\\" campaign, which appeared to be an improvement over its predecessors.\\r\\nFollowing the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated McDonald's. In February the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based Chipotle Mexican Grill chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items. McFlurry desserts, developed by a Canadian franchisee in 1997, proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. That same month, McDonald's said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new just-in-time system, dubbed \\"Made for You\\", was in development for a number of years and aimed to deliver to customers \\"fresher, hotter food\\"; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy's); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system's enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald's offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999.\\r\\nIn May 1998, Greenberg was named president and CEO of McDonald's Corporation, with Quinlan remaining chairman; at the same time Alan D. Feldman, who had joined the company only four years earlier from Pizza Hut, replaced Greenberg as president of McDonald's U.S.A., an unusual move for a company whose executives typically were long-timers. The following month brought another first, McDonald's first job cuts. The company said it would eliminate 525 employees from its headquarters staff, a cut of about 23 percent. In the second quarter of 1998 McDonald's took a $160 million charge in relation to the cuts. As a result, the company, for the first time since it went public in 1965, recorded a decrease in net income, from $1.64 billion in 1997 to $1.55 billion in 1998.\\r\\nMcDonald's followed up its investment in Chipotle with several more moves beyond the burger business. In March 1999 the company bought Aroma Caf, a UK chain of 23 upscale coffee and sandwich shops. In July of that year McDonald's added Donatos Pizza, a midwestern chain of 143 pizzerias based in Columbus, Ohio. Donatos had revenues of $120 million in 1997. In 1999, McDonald's 25,000th unit opened, Greenberg took on the additional post of chairman, and Jim Cantalupo was named company president. Cantalupo, who had joined the company as controller in 1974 and later became head of McDonald's International, had been vice-chairman, a position he retained. In May 2000 McDonald's completed its largest acquisition yet, buying the bankrupt Boston Market chain for $173.5 million in cash and debt. At the time, there were more than 850 Boston Market outlets, which specialized in home-style meals, with rotisserie chicken the lead menu item. Revenue at Boston Market during 1999 totaled $670 million. McDonald's rounded out its acquisition spree in early 2001 by buying a 33 percent stake in Pret A Manger, an upscale urban-based chain specializing in ready-to-eat sandwiches made on the premises. There were more than 110 Pret shops in the United Kingdom and several more in New York City. Also during 2001, McDonald's sold off Aroma Caf and took its McDonald's Japan affiliate public, selling a minority stake through an initial public offering.\\r\\nAs it was exploring new avenues of growth, however, McDonald's core burger chain had become plagued by problems. Most prominently, the Made for You system backfired. Although many franchisees believed that it succeeded in improving the quality of the food, it also increased service times and proved labor-intensive. Some franchisees also complained that the actual cost of implementing the system ran much higher than the corporation had estimated, a charge that McDonald's contested. In any case, there was no question that Made for You failed to reverse the chain's sluggish sales. Growth in sales at stores open more than a year (known as same-store sales) fell in both 2000 and 2001. Late in 2001 the company launched a restructuring involving the elimination of about 850 positions, 700 of which were in the US, and several restaurant closings.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2000, a McDonald's in Dearborn, Michigan in Greater Detroit was the first one in Michigan and the only one east of the Mississippi River to offer halal food for Muslim customers.[11]\\r\\nThere were further black eyes as well. McDonald's was sued in 2001 after it was revealed that for flavoring purposes a small amount of beef extract was being added to the vegetable oil used to cook the french fries. The company had cooked its fries in beef tallow until 1990, when it began claiming in ads that it used 100 percent vegetable oil. McDonald's soon apologized for any \\"confusion\\" that had been caused by its use of the beef flavoring, and in mid-2002 it reached a settlement in the litigation, agreeing to donate $10 million to Hindu, vegetarian, and other affected groups. Also in 2001, further embarrassment came when 51 people were charged with conspiring to rig McDonald's game promotions over the course of several years. It was revealed that $24 million of winning McDonald's game tickets had been stolen as part of the scam. McDonald's was not implicated in the scheme, which centered on a worker at an outside company that had administered the promotions.\\r\\nMcDonald's also had to increasingly battle its public image as a purveyor of fatty, unhealthy food. Consumers began filing lawsuits contending that years of eating at McDonald's had made them overweight. McDonald's responded by introducing low-calorie menu items and switching to a more healthful cooking oil for its french fries. McDonald's franchises overseas became a favorite target of people and groups expressing anti-American and/or anti-globalization sentiments. In August 1999 a group of protesters led by farmer Jos Bov destroyed a half-built McDonald's restaurant in Millau, France. In 2002 Bov, who gained fame from the incident, served a three-month jail sentence for the act, which he said was in protest against U.S. trade protectionism. McDonald's was also one of three multinational corporations (along with Starbucks Corporation and Nike, Inc.) whose outlets in Seattle were attacked in late 1999 by some of the more aggressive protesters against a World Trade Organization meeting taking place there. In the early 2000s McDonald's pulled out of several countries, including Bolivia and two Middle Eastern nations, at least in part because of the negative regard with which the brand was held in some areas.\\r\\nEarly in 2002, Cantalupo retired after 28 years of service. Sales remained lackluster that year, and in October the company attempted to revive U.S. sales through the introduction of a low-cost Dollar Menu. In December 2002, after this latest initiative to reignite sales growth failed and also after profits fell in seven of the previous eight quarters, Greenberg announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Cantalupo came out of retirement to become chairman and CEO at the beginning of 2003.\\r\\nCantalupo started his tenure by announcing a major restructuring that involved the 2002 quarterly loss, which included the closure of more than 700 restaurants (mostly in the United States and Japan), the elimination of 600 jobs, and charges of $853 million. The charges resulted in a fourth-quarter 2002 loss of $343.8 million, the first quarterly loss in McDonald's 38 years as a public company. The new CEO also shifted away from the company's traditional reliance on growth through the opening of new units to a focus on gaining more sales from existing units. By 2003, with Ray Kroc's McDonald's Corporation nearly 50 and the McDonald's fast food restaurant concept itself old enough to qualify for AARP membership, the brand had perhaps become too familiar and sales figures stalled. Analysts, management, owners, and customers alike recognized that the aged chain required revivification. The question in need of solution was: How should McDonald's reinvent itself without losing its core values and maintain relevance in the marketplace? To that end, several new menu items were successfully launched, including entree salads, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches (which used pancakes in place of bread), and white-meat Chicken McNuggets. Some outlets began test-marketing fruits and vegetables as Happy Meal options. It was quickly determined that focus on customer experience was key in reversing the slippage. Then, a new global marketing campaign was adopted which was designed around the notion of the \\"Rolling Energy\\" phase. Launched on September 29, 2003, the campaign began featuring youthful images, hip music, and pop culture celebrities touting the tagline, \\"I'm lovin' it\\". Next, James R. Cantalupo was called back from retirement to head the corporation and its efforts to recapture golden luster. His plan was to keep things simple with a focus on the basics like customer service, clean restrooms, and reliable appealing food (not unlike Ray Kroc's mantra of QSC and V: Quality, Service, Cleanliness, and Value). In addition to the basics he determined to position the company with a more modern coherent image in order to foster a McDonald's \\"experience\\" for customers. More than an advertising campaign he and his team approved sweeping new architecture for McDonald's restaurants, the first major overhaul since 1969 when the now universally recognized signature double mansard roof became standard. In fact, Mr. Cantalupo personally approved abandonment of the ubiquitous and familiar mansard in favor of what became the \\"Forever Young\\" prototype topped with its swish eyebrow. This was the first global campaign in McDonald's history, as the new slogan was to be used in advertising in more than 100 countries. It also proved to be the first truly successful ad campaign in years; sales began rebounding, helped also by improvements in service. Cantalupo did not live to see the fruits of his labor and he died in 2004 just as his modern vision for McDonald's was getting underway. Nonetheless he had set things into motion causing a paradigm shift for the company resulting in a refreshed image without a dilution of brand identity.\\r\\nIn December 2003, for instance, same-store sales increased 7.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the entire year, after falling 2.1 percent in 2002. Also, in that month, McDonald's announced that it would further its focus on its core hamburger business by downsizing its other ventures. The company said that it would sell Donatos back to that chain's founder. In addition, it would discontinue development of non-McDonald's brands outside of the United States. This included Boston Market outlets in Canada and Australia and Donatos units in Germany. McDonald's kept its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald's Japan was slated to close its Pret units there. These moves would enable the company to concentrate its international efforts on the McDonald's chain, while reducing the non-hamburger brands in the United States to Chipotle and Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black.\\r\\nMcDonald's continued to curtail store openings in 2004 and to concentrate on building business at existing restaurants. Much of the more than $1.5 billion budgeted for capital expenditures in 2004 was slated to be used to remodel existing restaurants. McDonald's also aimed to pay down debt by $400 million to $700 million and to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cantalupo also set several long-term goals, such as sustaining annual systemwide sales and revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. In a move to both simplify the menu and make its offerings less fattening, McDonald's announced in March 2004 that it would phase out Super Size french fries and soft drinks by the end of the year.\\r\\nIn the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, \\"no loitering\\" had been McDonald's motto. Ray Kroc had decreed upon the origins of his version of the chain that pay telephones, jukeboxes, and vending machines of any kind were forbidden at McDonald's restaurants. The goal had been to quickly serve customers and not force them to stay in the restaurants any longer than it took them to eat a hamburger. Along that line of thinking, dining areas were designed with minimalist hard plastic tables and chairs which were more often than not bolted in place. Thus customers consumed their fast food in scant comfort without dillydally allowing room for the next hurrying customers.\\r\\nWith the new \\"Forever Young\\" design (adopted in 2006), the first major redesign since 1969, McDonald's turned a new page for itself. New and remodeled restaurants feature dining zones with \\"distinct personalities\\". Most of them offer three sections or zones. A linger zone was designed to accommodate people who were inclined to dawdle and socialize while sitting comfortably on armchairs or sofas using free wifi access. Another zone offers counters and stools for patrons in a hurry who might just grab and go. The third and perhaps most important zone is the one for families or groups where seating arrangements can be reconfigured to meet a variety of needs. Also, harsh colors and hard plastics have been replaced with custom earth tones and flexible padded fabric covered booth seating all in hopes of engaging diners to loiter and perhaps spend more money and in addition to architecture and furnishings, the McDonald's menu has been tweaked to offer a larger variety of what the corporation refers to as more healthy food.\\r\\nMcDonald's franchises are required to follow the directions of the parent company and perhaps more than a few have complained about the Forever Young changes. First, customers needed to recognize the mansard buildings and identify McDonald's with thema new look may initially generate some degree of confusion. The next objection is cost: as of 2008, a newly built swish-brow store was said to cost upwards of $1 million and renovation of an existing unit to meet the new standards as much as $400,000. With a large percentage of sales from drive-in business, franchises could argue that the expensive interior redesign is unwarranted for their bottom lines.\\r\\nIn May 2010, McDonald's redesigned its US website to a sleeker, HTML 5 friendly interface. Along with those changes, McDonald's also introduced new advertising material to its website, including the unveiling of new pictures used exclusively for in-restaurant ads, television commercials, print advertising, and online advertising, which consist of more realistic pictures of its products, which are now up close and face the camera instead of facing left or right.\\r\\nIn July 2011, McDonald's announced that their largest restaurant in the world will be built on the 2012 London Olympics site. The restaurant will contain over 1,500 seats and is half the length of an American Football field. Over 470 staff will be employed serving on average (during the 2012 Olympics) 100,000 portions of fries, 50,000 Big Macs and 30,000 Milkshakes. This restaurant will overshadow the current largest McDonald's in the world in Moscow, Russia.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn January 2012, the company announced revenue for 2011 reached an all-time high of $27 billion, and that 2,400 restaurants would be updated and 1,300 new ones opened worldwide.[12]\\r\\nIn the middle of the decade, the restaurant began to suffer from declining profits. [13]In response, McDonald's began to offer it's breakfast menu all day starting in 2015. [14] At At first, the launch was unpopular with franchisees who claimed that the changes caused service to slow down. [13] However, the plan payed off with CNBC reporting that the company's fourth quarter earning \\" easily topped analysts' forecasts\\".

The stirrup-shaped small bone is on and transmits these to the oval window, medially. The stapes is the smallest and lightest named bone in the human body, and is so-called because of its resemblance to a stirrup (Latin: Stapes).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stapes is the third bone of the three ossicles in the middle ear. The stapes is a stirrup-shaped bone, and the smallest in the human body. It rests on the oval window, to which it is connected by an annular ligament. The stapes is described as having a base, resting on the oval window, as well as a head that articulates with the incus. These are connected by anterior and posterior limbs (Latin: crura).[1]:862 The stapes articulates with the incus through the incudostapedial joint.[2] The stapes is the smallest bone in the human body, and measures roughly 3 x 2.5mm, greater along the head-base span.[3]\\r\\nThe stapes develops from the second pharyngeal arch during the sixth to eighth week of embryological life. The central cavity of the stapes, the obturator foramen, is due to the presence embryologically of the stapedial artery, which usually regresses.[2][4]\\r\\nThe stapes is one of three ossicles in mammals. In non-mammalian four-legged animals, the bone homologous to the stapes is usually called the columella; however, in reptiles, either term may be used. In fish, the homologous bone is called the hyomandibular, and is part of the gill arch supporting either the spiracle or the jaw, depending on the species. The equivalent term in amphibians is the pars media plectra.[2][5]:481ÿ482\\r\\nThe stapes appears to be relatively constant in size in different ethnic groups.[6] In 0.01-0.02% of people, the stapedial artery does not regress, and persists in the central foramen.[7] In this case, a pulsatile sound may be heard in the affected ear, or there may be no symptoms at all.[8] Rarely, the stapes may be completely absent.[9][10]:262\\r\\nSituated between the incus and the inner ear, the stapes transmits sound vibrations from the incus to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve.[1]:861ÿ863\\r\\nOtosclerosis is a congenital or spontaneous-onset disease characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the inner ear. Often this causes the stapes to adhere to the oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females.[11] Two common treatments are stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole.[12] :661 Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage to the base of the bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base.[7][10] :254ÿ262\\r\\nThe stapes is commonly described as having been discovered by the professor Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia in 1546 at the University of Naples,[13] although this remains the nature of some controversy, as Ingrassia's description was published posthumously in his 1603 anatomical commentary In Galeni librum de ossibus doctissima et expectatissima commentaria. Spanish anatomist Pedro Jimeno is first to have been credited with a published description, in Dialogus de re medica (1549).[14] The bone is so-named because of its resemblance to a stirrup (Latin: stapes), an example of a late Latin word, probably created in mediaeval times from \\"to stand\\" (Latin: stapia), as stirrups did not exist in the early Latin-speaking world.[15]","input":"Which is the small bone in human body?"},{"output":"Bloomington, Illinois","context":"State Farm is a large group of insurance and financial services companies in the United States.\\r\\nThe group's main business is State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, a mutual insurance firm that also owns the other State Farm companies.

Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]\\r\\nThe State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.\\r\\nOn December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the companys core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the companys 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in todays digital world.[12]\\r\\nState Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company is the parent company of several wholly owned State Farm subsidiaries:[1]\\r\\nThis commercial structure is from State Farm's \\"Get to a Better State\\" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farms brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle like a good neighbor, State Farm is there. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]\\r\\nState Farm also has commercials beginning with the words \\"State of...\\" and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: \\"It's Jake from State Farm\\". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, \\"What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'\\", to which the agent responds in a timid way, \\"Uh, khakis\\". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, \\"She sounds hideous\\", where the husband replies, \\"Well she's a guy, so\\"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.\\r\\nIn late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will \\"never\\" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is \\"never letting go.\\" The commercial is based on the saying \\"never say never\\" and how people say that they will \\"never\\" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]\\r\\nThe Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]\\r\\nThe commercial series currently has four commercials made, including \\"Robbed\\",\\"Dropping Dimes\\", \\"No Good Clipper\\" and \\"The Hawks and The Hornets\\".\\r\\nState Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.\\r\\nThe bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]\\r\\nBack in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.\\r\\nIn early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]\\r\\nIn 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]\\r\\nA 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F \\"Dickie\\" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]\\r\\nState Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]\\r\\nState Farm Safety Patrol ÿ State Farm, in partnership with several U.S. highway authorities, operates a service called the State Farm Safety Patrol which provides free roadside assistance to stranded motorists on participating highways, when you call the designated telephone number for the Safety Patrol they will respond and provide the following services: fuel refills; radiator refills; engine oil refills.

Directed by John Landis, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Jackson, the song was released from Jackson's sixth studio album of the same name. It was MTV's first world premiere video. In the United Kingdom, the video was aired on Channel 4 late at night. Voted as the most influential pop music video of all time,[3] Thriller proved to have a profound effect on popular culture,[4][5] and was named \\"a watershed moment for the [music] industry\\"[3] for its unprecedented merging of filmmaking and music. Guinness World Records listed it in 2006 as the \\"most successful music video\\", selling over nine million copies.[6] In 2009, the video was inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, the first music video to ever receive this honor, for being \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically\\" significant.[7] The track was also listed at number one on \\"The Top 10 Halloween Songs\\" by Billboard.[8]\\r\\nCo-starring with Jackson was former Playboy centerfold Ola Ray. The video was choreographed by Michael Peters (who had worked with the singer on his prior hit \\"Beat It\\"), and Jackson. Jackson contacted Landis after seeing his film An American Werewolf in London; make-up artist Rick Baker and composer Elmer Bernstein (who composed incidental music for the video) were also brought from the film to work on the video. The video (like the song) contains a spoken word performance by horror film veteran Vincent Price. \\"Thriller\\" was the third and final video for the Thriller album. The red jacket that Jackson wore was designed by Landis' wife Deborah Landis to make him appear more \\"virile\\".[9]\\r\\nTo qualify for an Academy Award as a short subject, the film was shown in a theatrical screening along with the 1940 Disney animated feature Fantasia in December 1983; however, the video failed to earn an Academy Award nomination.[10] As of May 11, 2018, the video has garnered over 512 million views on YouTube.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to Jackson being a Jehovah's Witness at the time, the video begins with a disclaimer that reads:\\r\\nDue to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this film in no way endorses a belief in the occult.\\r\\nMichael Jackson\\r\\nOn a night set in the 1950s, a teenaged Michael and his unnamed girl of interest, (Ola Ray), run out of gas while driving in a wooded area. They walk into the forest as they leave the car behind and Michael asks her to be his girlfriend. She accepts and he gives her a ring. However, he then tells her that he is \\"not like other guys.\\" She tells him that's the reason she loves him, but Michael insists that she doesn't understand what he means. As his girlfriend asks what he's talking about, a full moon appears, and Michael begins transforming into a werecat,[3] growling at her to leave in the process. The girl screams in terror and attempts to escape, but the werecat chases her, knocks her down, lunges at her with his claws, and attacks her (off-screen).\\r\\nThe scene then cuts to a movie theater where Michael and his unnamed girlfriend, along with an excitable audience, are actually watching the scene unfold in a Vincent Price horror movie titled \\"Thriller\\". Afraid, Michael's girlfriend leaves the theater and Michael follows, telling her, \\"It's only a movie.\\" Some debate follows as to whether or not she was scared by the movie; she denies it, but Michael disagrees.\\r\\nThey then walk down a foggy road as Michael sings verses of the song excluding the chorus. They pass a nearby graveyard, in which the undead begin to rise out of their graves as Vincent Price's speech is heard. The zombies corner the two main characters threateningly, and suddenly, Michael becomes a zombie himself. The zombies then break into an elaborate dance number, followed by the main chorus of \\"Thriller\\" (during which Michael reverts to human form), frightening his date to the point where she runs for cover.\\r\\nMichael (who has turned back into a zombie) and his fellow corpses chase the terrified girl into the room of a nearby abandoned house. While being cornered, Michael then reaches for the girl's throat as she lets out a horrifying shriek, only to awake and realize it was all a nightmare. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily accepts. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns to the camera with a sinister grin, revealing his yellow werecat eyes from the opening scene, as Vincent Price offers one last spine-tingling and echoing laugh.\\r\\nAs the credits are shown, a reprise scene is shown and at the end of the credits the zombies dance back to their graves as a disclaimer appears saying that \\"Any similarity to actual events or persons living, dead, (or undead) is purely coincidental\\", the same disclaimer that appeared in An American Werewolf in London also directed by Landis. After that, a zombie breaks the fourth wall and gives a terrifying grimace to the audience as the screen fades to black.\\r\\n\\"Thriller\\"\\r\\nIn December 2009, it was selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress along with 24 other films.[17] It was the first ever (and to this day, only) music video to be selected.[18] The Registry titled Thriller as \\"the most famous music video of all time\\".[19] The coordinator of the National Film Preservation Board, who decides upon candidates for inclusion in the National Film Registry, Steve Legett, said \\"The time is right\\" for Thriller to be included, because of the death of Jackson that year.[18]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1983, Thriller had begun to decline in sales. Walter Yetnikoff and Larry Stessel answered calls throughout the night from Jackson. \\"Walter, the record isnt No. 1 anymore,\\" Yetnikoff recalls Jackson saying. \\"What are we going to do about it?\\" 'Were going to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow,'\\" Yetnikoff remembered answering. Jackson manager Frank DiLeo first mentioned the idea of making a third video, and pressed Jackson to consider the albums title track. \\"Its simpleall youve got to do is dance, sing, and make it scary,\\" DiLeo recalls telling Jackson.[21]\\r\\nIn early August, after seeing An American Werewolf in London, Jackson contacted John Landis to direct the video. At the time, commercial motion-picture directors did not direct music videos, but Landis was intrigued.[21]\\r\\nThe music video was filmed at the Palace Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, the zombie dance sequence at the junction of Union Pacific Avenue and South Calzona Street in East Los Angeles and the final house scene in the Angeleno Heights neighborhood at 1345 Carroll Avenue. All principal photography was done in mid-October 1983.[22]\\r\\nIn an interview that aired December 11, 1999 for MTV's 100 Greatest Videos Ever Made, Jackson spoke about the making of the video:\\r\\nMy idea was to make this short film with conversation ... in the beginning ÿ I like having a beginning and a middle and an ending, which would follow a story. I'm very much involved in complete making and creating of the piece. It has to be, you know, my soul. Usually, you know, it's an interpretation of the music. It was a delicate thing to work on because I remember my original approach was, 'How do you make zombies and monsters dance without it being comical?' So I said, 'We have to do just the right kind of movement so it doesn't become something that you laugh at.' But it just has to take it to another level. So I got in a room with [choreographer] Michael Peters, and he and I together kind of imagined how these zombies move by making faces in the mirror. I used to come to rehearsal sometimes with monster makeup on, and I loved doing that. So he and I collaborated and we both choreographed the piece and I thought it should start like that kind of thing and go into this jazzy kind of step, you know. Kind of gruesome things like that, not too much ballet or whatever.\\r\\nAccording to Kobena Mercer, \\"the video is strewn with allusions to horror films\\".[24] The opening scene is a parody of 1950s B movie horror films, with the characters dressed in the fashions of 1950s teenagers. The metamorphosis of the polite 'boy next door' into a werecat can be seen as a depiction of male sexuality. A sexuality that is depicted as naturally bestial, predatory, aggressive, violent and therefore monstrous.[24] Mercer perceived similarities with the werewolf depiction in The Company of Wolves (1984).[24]\\r\\nThe second metamorphosis of the video has Michael becoming a zombie. It serves as an introduction to a dance sequence which features dancing ghouls, corresponding to a song lyric mentioning a masquerade ball of the dead.[25] The scene calls attention to the macabre make-up of the ghouls. Jackson's own make-up casts \\"a ghostly pallor\\" over his skin and emphasizes the outline of his skull. The image itself serves as an allusion to the mask from The Phantom of the Opera (1925).[25]\\r\\nAccording to Peter Dendle the zombie invasion sequence of the film is inspired by Night of the Living Dead (1968). The film manages to treat the sequence with enough seriousness to capture the feelings of claustrophobia and helplessness which are essential to the subgenre of zombie films.[26]\\r\\nReleased in tandem with the video was an hour-long documentary providing candid glimpses behind the scenes of the production. Called Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, it, too, was shown heavily on MTV for a time and was the top-selling home-video release of all time at one point, with over 9 million copies sold. The VHS also included video clips from the songs \\"Can You Feel It\\", \\"Beat It\\", and the Motown 25 performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" as well as audio clips from Jackson's songs \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Workin' Day and Night\\".\\r\\nMTV paid $250,000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights; and Vestron Music Video reportedly put down an additional $500,000 to market the cassette, in \\"a profit participation.\\"[27]\\r\\nRick Baker expected to have a few weeks to do the special effects make up for the zombies (which usually requires impressions to be taken of the actors face to base the prosthetics on) only to find out the dancers would not be cast until a few days before shooting began. It was decided to do generic make up for the dancers (using a combination of precast prosthetics) while members of Baker's crew in the more elaborate make up for shots that featured more closeups (like the zombie coming out of the manhole)\\r\\nIn 2009, Jackson sold the rights of \\"Thriller\\" to the Nederlander Organization, to stage a Broadway musical based on the video.\\r\\nJackson was sued by Landis in a dispute over royalties for the video; Landis claims that he is owed four years worth of royalties.[28][29]\\r\\nOla Ray has also complained about difficulties collecting royalties. At first, Ray blamed Jackson, but then she apologized to him in 1997. However, Ray did sue Jackson on May 6, 2009 in a dispute to obtain uncollected royalties.[30] less than two months before Jackson's death on June 25. Eventually the Jackson Family Trust settled.[31]\\r\\nFollowing the success of the \\"Thriller\\" video, a Hollywood production company reportedly began serious work on trying to turn Jackson's song \\"Billie Jean\\", which is also featured on Jackson's Thriller album, into a feature film, but no plans were ever completed.[32] Vinny Marino of ABC News commented that \\"Thriller\\"'s music video being selected as the \\"Greatest Video of All Time\\" was a \\"no-brainer\\" and remarked that, \\"Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" continues to be considered the greatest video ever by just about everyone.\\"[33] Gil Kaufman of MTV described the \\"Thriller\\" video as being \\"iconic\\" and felt that it was one of Jackson's \\"most enduring legacies\\".[34] Kaufman also noted that the music video was the \\"mini-movie that revolutionized music videos\\" and \\"cemented Jackson's status as one of the most ambitious, innovative pop stars of all time\\".[34] Steve Peake, of About.com, listed \\"Thriller\\" as being Jackson's eighth best song of the 1980s.[35] Patrick Kevin Day and Todd Martens, of The Los Angeles Times commented that,\\r\\n\\"Thriller's\\" phenomenal success led to a breaking down of traditional racial barriers on FM radio at the time. New York's WPLJ, a \\"white\\" station, played Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" because of Eddie Van Halen's appearance on it. The song caused a wave of protests from some listeners who didn't want \\"black\\" music on their station. MTV also had a reputation for favoring white performers at the time, and its heavy rotation of Jackson videos helped alleviate the criticism.[32]\\r\\nLeaders in Michael Jackson's religion were not so pleased, by contrast. In spite of his disclaimer at the beginning of the video, Jackson made a public \\"apology\\" in the pages of Awake!, a magazine published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. \\" 'I would never do it again!\\" says Jackson. \\"I just intended to do a good, fun short film, not to purposely bring to the screen something to scare people or to do anything bad. I want to do whats right. I would never do anything like that again.\\" Why not? \\"Because a lot of people were offended by it,\\" explains Jackson. \\"That makes me feel bad. I dont want them to feel that way. I realize now that it wasnt a good idea. Ill never do a video like that again!\\" He continues: \\"In fact, I have blocked further distribution of the film over which I have control, including its release in some other countries. Theres all kinds of promotional stuff being proposed on Thriller. But I tell them, No, no, no. I dont want to do anything on Thriller. No more Thriller. \\"[36]\\r\\nIn December 2009, the music video for \\"Thriller\\" was selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, \\"Thriller\\" is the first music video to ever be inducted.[37] The Registry explained, \\"because of the way the recording industry is evolving and changing, we thought it would be good to go back to the development of an earlier seismic shift, which was the development of the music video\\"[34] and described the music video as being \\"the most famous music video of all time\\".[38] The coordinator of the National Film Preservation Board, who decides upon candidates for inclusion in the National Film Registry, Steve Legett, noted that the music video was considered for induction for years, but was chosen mainly due to Jackson's death that year.[39] In a poll conducted by Myspace in 2010, which asked over one thousand users on their site to name the most influential music video of all time from a list of twenty videos selected by music and entertainment critics, Michael Jackson's Thriller was voted the most influential video.[40]\\r\\nIn 2002 Lexington, Kentucky, became the first city to launch a \\"Thriller\\" reenactment as a Halloween festivity. The videos storyline and dance sequences were recreated, beginning outside the Kentucky Theater and featuring hundreds of zombies who attended rehearsals at nearby Mecca Live Studio in the weeks leading up to the parade. Lexingtons annual Thriller Parade attracts around 20,000 spectators and features multiple actors playing the role of Michael Jackson.","input":"When was thriller video first shown in uk?"},{"output":"the pons","context":"The respiratory center is located in the medulla oblongata and pons, in the brainstem. The respiratory center is made up of three major respiratory groups of neurons, two in the medulla and one in the pons. In the medulla they are the dorsal respiratory group, and the ventral respiratory group. In the pons, the pontine respiratory group includes two areas known as the pneumotaxic centre and the apneustic centre.\\r\\nThe respiratory centre is responsible for generating and maintaining the rhythm of respiration, and also of adjusting this in homeostatic response to physiological changes. The respiratory center receives input from chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, the cerebral cortex, and the hypothalamus in order to regulate the rate and depth of breathing. Input is stimulated by altered levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH, by hormonal changes relating to stress, and anxiety from the hypothalamus, and also by signals from the cerebral cortex to give a conscious control of respiration.\\r\\nInjury to respiratory groups can cause various breathing disorders that may require mechanical ventilation, and is usually associated with a poor prognosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe respiratory centre is divided into three major groups, two in the medulla and one in the pons. The two groups in the medulla are the dorsal respiratory group and the ventral respiratory group. In the pons, the pontine respiratory group is made up of two areas ÿ the pneumotaxic centre and the apneustic centre. The dorsal and ventral medullary groups control the basic rhythm of respiration.[1][2]\\r\\nIn the medulla, the dorsal respiratory group makes up the inhalation area of respiratory control.\\r\\nIn the medulla, the ventral respiratory group make up the exhalation area of respiratory control.\\r\\nIn the pons, the pontine respiratory group includes the pneumotaxic and apneustic centers. These have connections between them, and from both to the solitary nucleus.[3]\\r\\nThe pneumotaxic center is located in the upper part of the pons. Its nuclei are the subparabrachial nucleus and the medial parabrachial nucleus.[4] The pneumotaxic center controls both the rate and the pattern of breathing. The pneumotaxic center is considered an antagonist to the apneustic center, (which produces abnormal breathing during inhalation) cyclically inhibiting inhalation. The pneumotaxic center is responsible for limiting inspiration, providing an inspiratory off-switch (IOS).[5] It limits the burst of action potentials in the phrenic nerve, effectively decreasing the tidal volume and regulating the respiratory rate. Absence of the center results in an increase in depth of respiration and a decrease in respiratory rate.\\r\\nThe pneumotaxic center regulates the amount of air that can be taken into the body in each breath. The dorsal respiratory group has rhythmic bursts of activity that are constant in duration and interval.[6] When a faster rate of breathing is needed the pneumotaxic center signals the dorsal respiratory group to speed up. When longer breaths are needed the bursts of activity are elongated. All the information that the body uses to help respiration happens in the pneumotaxic center. If this was damaged or in any way harmed it would make breathing almost impossible.\\r\\nOne study on this subject was on anesthetized paralyzed cats before and after bilateral vagotomy. Ventilation was monitored in awake and anesthetized cats breathing air or CO2. Ventilation was monitored both before and after lesions to the pneumotaxic center region and after subsequent bilateral vagotomy. Cats with pontine lesions had a prolonged inhalation duration.[7] In cats, after anaesthesia and bivagotomy, pontine transection has been described as evoking a long sustained inspiratory discharges interrupted by short expiratory pauses.[jargon] In rats on the other hand, after anaesthesia, bivagotomy and pontine transection, this breathing pattern was not observed, either in vivo or in vitro. These results suggest interspecies differences between rat and cat in the pontine influences on the medullary respiratory center.[8]\\r\\nThe apneustic center of the lower pons appears to promote inhalation by a constant stimulation of the neurons in the medulla oblongata. The apneustic center sends signals to the dorsal group in the medulla to delay the 'switch off', the inspiratory off switch (IOS) signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the pneumotaxic centre. It controls the intensity of breathing, giving positive impulses to the neurons involved with inhalation. The apneustic center is inhibited by pulmonary stretch receptors and also by the pneumotaxic center. It also discharges an inhibitory impulse to the pneumotaxic center.\\r\\nBreathing is the repetitive process of bringing air into the lungs and taking waste products out. The oxygen brought in from the air is a constant, on-going need of an organism to maintain life. This need is still there during sleep so that the functioning of this process has to be automatic and be part of the autonomic nervous system. The in-breath is followed by the out-breath, giving the respiratory cycle of inhalation and exhalation. The number of cycles per minute is the respiratory rate. The respiratory rate is set in the respiratory center by the dorsal respiratory group, in the medulla, and these neurons are mostly concentrated in the solitary nucleus that extends the length of the medulla.[9]\\r\\nThe basic rhythm of respiration is that of quiet, restful breathing known as eupnea. Quiet breathing only requires the activity of the dorsal group which activates the diaphragm, and the external intercostal muscles. Exhalation is passive and relies on the elastic recoil of the lungs. When the metabolic need for oxygen increases, inspiration becomes more forceful and the neurons in the ventral group are activated to bring about forceful exhalation.[10]\\r\\nDepression of the respiratory centre can be caused by: brain trauma, brain damage, a brain tumour, or ischemia. A depression can also be caused by drugs including opioids, and sedatives.\\r\\nThe respiratory centre can be stimulated by amphetamine, to produce faster and deeper breaths.[11] Normally at therapeutic doses, this effect is not noticeable, but may be evident when respiration is already compromised.[11]","input":"Where are the pneumotaxic and apneustic centers located?"},{"output":"the placenta","context":"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta after implantation.[1][2] The presence of hCG is detected in some pregnancy tests (HCG pregnancy strip tests). Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone; therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant may lead to a cancer diagnosis and, if high enough, paraneoplastic syndromes, however, it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause, or an effect of carcinogenesis. The pituitary analog of hCG, known as luteinizing hormone (LH), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.[1][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding endogenous forms of hCG, there are various ways to categorize and measure them, including total hCG, C-terminal peptide total hCG, intact hCG, free -subunit hCG, -core fragment hCG, hyperglycosylated hCG, nicked hCG, alpha hCG, and pituitary hCG. Regarding pharmaceutical preparations of hCG from animal or synthetic sources, there are many gonadotropin preparations, some of which are medically justified and others of which are of a quack nature. As of  December?6, 2011[update], the United States Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the sale of \\"homeopathic\\" and over-the-counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein composed of 237 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.7 kDa, approximately 14.5 ϫhCG and 22.2kDa hCG.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is heterodimeric, with an ϫ (alpha) subunit identical to that of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and  (beta) subunit that is unique to hCG.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two subunits create a small hydrophobic core surrounded by a high surface area-to-volume ratio: 2.8 times that of a sphere.  The vast majority of the outer amino acids are hydrophilic.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin interacts with the LHCG receptor of the ovary and promotes the maintenance of the corpus luteum during the beginning of pregnancy. This allows the corpus luteum to secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can sustain the growing fetus[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to its highly negative charge, hCG may repel the immune cells of the mother, protecting the fetus during the first trimester[citation needed]. It has also been hypothesized that hCG may be a placental link for the development of local maternal immunotolerance[citation needed]. For example, hCG-treated endometrial cells induce an increase in T cell apoptosis (dissolution of T cells).  These results suggest that hCG may be a link in the development of peritrophoblastic immune tolerance, and may facilitate the trophoblast invasion, which is known to expedite fetal development in the endometrium.[11] It has also been suggested that hCG levels are linked to the severity of morning sickness or Hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnant women.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of its similarity to LH, hCG can also be used clinically to induce ovulation in the ovaries as well as testosterone production in the testes. As the most abundant biological source is women who are presently pregnant, some organizations collect urine from pregnant women to extract hCG for use in fertility treatment.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin also plays a role in cellular differentiation/proliferation and may activate apoptosis.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, it is produced in the human placenta by the syncytiotrophoblast.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike any other gonadotropins, it can be extracted from the urine of pregnant women or produced from cultures of genetically modified cells using recombinant DNA technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Pubergen, Pregnyl, Follutein, Profasi, Choragon and Novarel, it is extracted from the urine of pregnant women. In Ovidrel, it is produced with recombinant DNA technology.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding endogenous forms of hCG, there are various ways to categorize and measure them, including total hCG, C-terminal peptide total hCG, intact hCG, free -subunit hCG, -core fragment hCG, hyperglycosylated hCG, nicked hCG, alpha hCG, and pituitary hCG.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegular hCG is the main form of hCG associated with the majority of pregnancy and in non-invasive molar pregnancies.  This is produced in the trophoblast cells of the placental tissue. Hyperglycosylated hCG is the main form of hCG during the implantation phase of pregnancy, with invasive molar pregnancies, and with choriocarcinoma.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding pharmaceutical preparations of hCG from animal or synthetic sources, there are many gonadotropin preparations, some of which are medically justified and others of which are of a quack nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood or urine tests measure hCG. These can be pregnancy tests. hCG-positive indicates an implanted blastocyst and mammalian embryogenesis. These can be done to diagnose and monitor germ cell tumors and gestational trophoblastic diseases.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcentrations are commonly reported in thousandth international units per milliliter (mIU/ml). The international unit of hCG was originally established in 1938 and has been redefined in 1964 and in 1980.[17] At the present time, 1 international unit is equal to approximately 2.35G10?12 moles,[18] or about 6G10?8 grams.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost tests employ a monoclonal antibody, which is specific to the -subunit of hCG (-hCG). This procedure is employed to ensure that tests do not make false positives by confusing hCG with LH and FSH. (The latter two are always present at varying levels in the body, whereas the presence of hCG almost always indicates pregnancy.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMany hCG immunoassays are based on the sandwich principle, which uses antibodies to hCG labeled with an enzyme or a conventional or luminescent dye.\\r\\nPregnancy urine dipstick tests are based on the lateral flow technique.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of serum hCG levels. (LMP is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of the last menstrual period.) The levels grow exponentially after conception and implantation.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability to quantitate the hCG level is useful in the monitoring germ cell and trophoblastic tumors, follow-up care after miscarriage, and in diagnosis of and follow-up care after treatment of ectopic pregnancy. The lack of a visible fetus on vaginal ultrasound after the hCG levels have reached 1500 mIU/ml is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy.[23] Still, even an hCG over 2000 IU/l does not necessarily exclude the presence of a viable intrauterine pregnancy in such cases.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs pregnancy tests, quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually detect hCG between 6 and 12 days after ovulation.[25] It must be taken into account, however, that total hCG levels may vary in a very wide range within the first 4 weeks of gestation, leading to false results during this period.[26] A rise of 35% over 48 hours is proposed as the minimal rise consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nGestational trophoblastic disease like hydatidiform moles (\\"molar pregnancy\\") or choriocarcinoma may produce high levels of hCG (due to the presence of syncytialtrophoblasts- part of the villi that make up the placenta) despite the absence of an embryo. This, as well as several other conditions, can lead to elevated hCG readings in the absence of pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nhCG levels are also a component of the triple test, a screening test for certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities/birth defects.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study of 32 normal pregnancies came to the result a gestational sac of 1ÿ3?mm was detected at a mean hCG level of 1150 IU/l (range 800-1500), a yolk sac was detected at a mean level of 6000 IU/l (range 4500-7500) and fetal heartbeat was visible at a mean hCG level of 10,000 IU/l (range 8650-12,200).[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin can be used as a tumor marker,[28] as its  subunit is secreted by some cancers including seminoma, choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors, hydatidiform mole, teratoma with elements of choriocarcinoma, and islet cell tumor. For this reason, a positive result in males can be a test for testicular cancer. The normal range for men is between 0-5 mIU/mL. Combined with alpha-fetoprotein, -HCG is an excellent tumor marker for the monitoring of germ cell tumors.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin injection is extensively used for final maturation induction in lieu of luteinizing hormone. In the presence of one or more mature ovarian follicles, ovulation can be triggered by the administration of HCG. As ovulation will happen between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection,[29] procedures can be scheduled to take advantage of this time sequence,[30] such as intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse. Also, patients that undergo IVF, in general, receive HCG to trigger the ovulation process, but have an oocyte retrieval performed at about 34 to 36 hours after injection by, a few hours before the eggs actually would be released from the ovary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs HCG supports the corpus luteum, administration of HCG is used in certain circumstances to enhance the production of progesterone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the male, HCG injections are used to stimulate the Leydig cells to synthesize testosterone. The intratesticular testosterone is necessary for spermatogenesis from the sertoli cells. Typical uses for HCG in men include hypogonadism and fertility treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral vaccines against human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for the prevention of pregnancy are currently in clinical trials.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of female patients who want to be treated with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl:[32]\\r\\na) Since infertile female patients who undergo medically assisted reproduction (especially those who need in vitro fertilization), are known to often be suffering from tubal abnormalities, after a treatment with this drug they might experience many more ectopic pregnancies. This is why early ultrasound confirmation at the beginning of a pregnancy (to see whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or not) is crucial. Pregnancies that have occurred after a treatment with this medicine are submitted to a higher risk of multiplets. Female patients who have thrombosis, severe obesity, or thrombophilia should not be prescribed this medicine as they have a higher risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events after or during a treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl. b)Female patients who have been treated with this medicine are usually more prone to pregnancy losses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of male patients: A prolonged treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl is known to regularly lead to increased production of androgen. Therefore: Patients who are suffering from overt or latent cardiac failure, hypertension, renal dysfunction, migraines, or epilepsy might not be allowed to start using this medicine or may require a lower dose of HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl. Also this medicine should be used with extreme caution in the treatment of prepubescent teenagers in order to reduce the risk of precocious sexual development or premature epiphyseal closure. This type of patients' skeletal maturation should be closely and regularly monitored.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth male and female patients who have the following medical conditions must not start a treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl: (1) Hypersensitivity to this medicine or to any of its main ingredients. (2) Known or possible androgen-dependent tumors for example male breast carcinoma or prostatic carcinoma.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the world of performance-enhancing drugs, HCG is increasingly used in combination with various anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) cycles. As a result, HCG is included in some sports' illegal drug lists.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen exogenous AAS are put into the male body, natural negative-feedback loops cause the body to shut down its own production of testosterone via shutdown of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA). This causes testicular atrophy, among other things. HCG is commonly used during and after steroid cycles to maintain and restore testicular size as well as normal testosterone production.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh levels of AASs, that mimic the body's natural testosterone, trigger the hypothalamus to shut down its production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Without GnRH, the pituitary gland stops releasing luteinizing hormone (LH). LH normally travels from the pituitary via the blood stream to the testes, where it triggers the production and release of testosterone. Without LH, the testes shut down their production of testosterone.[34] In males, HCG helps restore and maintain testosterone production in the testes by mimicking LH and triggering the production and release of testosterone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf HCG is used for too long and in too high a dose, the resulting rise in natural testosterone and estrogen would eventually inhibit endogenous production of luteinizing hormone via negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional athletes who have tested positive for HCG have been temporarily banned from their sport, including a 50-game ban from MLB for Manny Ramirez in 2009[35] and a 4-game ban from the NFL for Brian Cushing for a positive urine test for HCG.[36] Mixed Martial Arts fighter Dennis Siver was fined $19,800 and suspended 9 months for being tested positive after his bout at UFC 168.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish endocrinologist Albert T. W. Simeons proposed HCG as an adjunct to an ultra-low-calorie weight-loss diet (fewer than 500 calories).[38] Simeons, while studying pregnant women in India on a calorie-deficient diet, and \\"fat boys\\" with pituitary problems (Fr?lich's syndrome) treated with low-dose HCG, observed that both lost fat rather than lean (muscle) tissue.[38] He reasoned that HCG must be programming the hypothalamus to do this in the former cases in order to protect the developing fetus by promoting mobilization and consumption of abnormal, excessive adipose deposits.  Simeons in 1954 published a book entitled Pounds and Inches, designed to combat obesity. Simeons, practicing at Salvator Mundi International Hospital in Rome, Italy, recommended low-dose daily HCG injections (125?IU) in combination with a customized ultra-low-calorie (500 cal/day, high-protein, low-carbohydrate/fat) diet, which was supposed to result in a loss of adipose tissue without loss of lean tissue.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther researchers did not find the same results when attempting experiments to confirm Simeons' conclusions, and in 1976 in response to complaints the FDA required Simeons and others to include the following disclaimer on all advertisements:[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese weight reduction treatments include the injection of HCG, a drug which has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective in the treatment of obesity or weight control. There is no substantial evidence that HCG increases weight loss beyond that resulting from caloric restriction, that it causes a more attractive or \\"normal\\" distribution of fat, or that it decreases the hunger and discomfort associated with calorie-restrictive diets.\\r\\nThere was a resurgence of interest in the \\"HCG diet\\" following promotion by Kevin Trudeau, who was banned  from making HCG diet weight-loss claims by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in 2008, and eventually jailed over such claims.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1976 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition[41] concluded that HCG is not more effective as a weight-loss aid than dietary restriction alone.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1995 meta analysis found that studies supporting HCG for weight loss were of poor methodological quality and concluded that \\"there is no scientific evidence that HCG is effective in the treatment of obesity; it does not bring about weight-loss or fat-redistribution, nor does it reduce hunger or induce a feeling of well-being\\".[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 15, 2016, the American Medical Association (AMA) passed policy that \\"The use of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for weight loss is inappropriate.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no scientific evidence that HCG is effective in the treatment of obesity. The meta-analysis found insufficient evidence supporting the claims that HCG is effective in altering fat-distribution, hunger reduction, or in inducing a feeling of well-being. The authors stated the use of HCG should be regarded as an inappropriate therapy for weight reduction In the authors opinion, Pharmacists and physicians should be alert on the use of HCG for Simeons therapy. The results of this meta-analysis support a firm standpoint against this improper indication. Restraints on physicians practicing this therapy can be based on our findings.\\r\\nAccording to the American Society of Bariatric Physicians, no new clinical trials have been published since the definitive 1995 meta-analysis.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific consensus is that any weight loss reported by individuals on an \\"HCG diet\\" may be attributed entirely to the fact that such diets prescribe calorie intake of between 500 and 1,000 calories per day, substantially below recommended levels for an adult, to the point that this may risk health effects associated with malnutrition.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nControversy about, and shortages[47] of, injected HCG for weight loss have led to substantial Internet promotion of \\"homeopathic HCG\\" for weight control. The ingredients in these products are often obscure, but if prepared from true HCG via homeopathic dilution, they contain either no HCG at all or only trace amounts. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that oral HCG is bioavailable due to the fact that digestive protease enzymes and hepatic metabolism renders peptide-based molecules (such as insulin and human growth hormone) biologically inert. HCG can likely only enter the bloodstream through injection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that over-the-counter products containing HCG are fraudulent and ineffective for weight loss. They are also not protected as homeopathic drugs and have been deemed illegal substances.[48][49] HCG is classified as a prescription drug in the United States and it has not been approved for over-the-counter sales by the FDA as a weight loss product or for any other purposes, and therefore neither HCG in its pure form nor any preparations containing HCG may be sold legally in the country except by prescription.[4] In December 2011, FDA and FTC started to take actions to pull unapproved HCG products from the market.[4] In the aftermath, some suppliers started to switch to \\"hormone-free\\" versions of their weight loss products, where the hormone is replaced with an unproven mixture of free amino acids[50] or where radionics is used to transfer the \\"energy\\" to the final product.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to induce a stronger immune response, some versions of human chorionic gonadotropin-based anti-fertility vaccines were designed as conjugates of the  subunit of HCG covalently linked to tetanus toxoid.[31][51] It has been alleged that a non-conjugated tetanus vaccine used in developing countries is laced with a human chorionic gonadotropin based anti-fertility drug[52] and is distributed as a means of mass sterilization.[53]  This charge has been vigorously denied by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF.[54]  Others have argued that a hCG laced vaccine could not be used for sterilization since the effects of the anti-fertility vaccines are reversible (requiring booster doses to maintain immunity) and a non-conjugated vaccine is likely to be ineffective.[55][56]  Finally, independent testing of the tetanus vaccine by Kenyas health authorities has revealed no traces of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone.[57]","input":"Where is human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) produced?"},{"output":"Colombia","context":"Below is a list of all the South American countries, in order of geographical area.

For example, an analysis of the motion of an object in an airliner in flight could be made relative to the airliner, to the surface of the Earth, or even to the Sun.[2] A reference frame that is at rest (or one that moves with no rotation and at constant velocity) relative to the \\"fixed stars\\" is generally taken to be an inertial frame. Any system can be analyzed in an inertial frame (and so with no centrifugal force). However, it is often more convenient to describe a rotating system by using a rotating frame--the calculations are simpler, and descriptions more intuitive. When this choice is made, fictitious forces, including the centrifugal force, arise.\\r\\nIn a rotating reference frame, all objects, regardless of their state of motion, appear to be under the influence of a radially (from the axis of rotation) outward force that is proportional to their mass, to the distance from the axis of rotation of the frame, and to the square of the angular velocity of the frame.[3][4] This is the centrifugal force.\\r\\nMotion relative to a rotating frame results in another fictitious force: the Coriolis force. If the rate of rotation of the frame changes, a third fictitious force (the Euler force) is required. These fictitious forces are necessary for the formulation of correct equations of motion in a rotating reference frame[5][6] and allow Newton's laws to be used in their normal form in such a frame (with one exception: the fictitious forces do not obey Newton's third law: they have no equal and opposite counterparts).[5]\\r\\nA common experience that gives rise to the idea of a centrifugal force is encountered by passengers riding in a vehicle, such as a car, that is changing direction. If a car is traveling at a constant speed along a straight road, then a passenger inside is not accelerating and, according to Newton's second law of motion, the net force acting on him is therefore zero (all forces acting on him cancel each other out). If the car enters a curve that bends to the left, the passenger experiences an apparent force that seems to be pulling him towards the right. This is the fictitious centrifugal force. It is needed within the passenger's local frame of reference to explain his sudden tendency to start accelerating to the right relative to the cara tendency which he must resist by applying a rightward force to the car (for instance, a frictional force against the seat) in order to remain in a fixed position inside. Since he pushes the seat toward the right, Newton's third law says that the seat pushes him toward the left. The centrifugal force must be included in the passenger's reference frame (in which the passenger remains at rest): it counteracts the leftward force applied to the passenger by the seat, and explains why this otherwise unbalanced force does not cause him to accelerate.[7] However, it would be apparent to a stationary observer watching from an overpass above that the frictional force exerted on the passenger by the seat is not being balanced; it constitutes a net force to the left, causing the passenger to accelerate toward the inside of the curve, as he must in order to keep moving with the car rather than proceeding in a straight line as he otherwise would. Thus the \\"centrifugal force\\" he feels is the result of a \\"centrifugal tendency\\" caused by inertia.[8] Similar effects are encountered in aeroplanes and roller coasters where the magnitude of the apparent force is often reported in \\"G's\\".\\r\\nIf a stone is whirled round on a string, in a horizontal plane, the only real force acting on the stone in the horizontal plane is applied by the string (gravity acts vertically). No other force acts on the stone so there is a net force on the stone in the horizontal plane.\\r\\nIn an inertial frame of reference, were it not for this net force acting on the stone, the stone would travel in a straight line, according to Newton's first law of motion. In order to keep the stone moving in a circular path, a centripetal force, in this case provided by the string, must be continuously applied to the stone. As soon as it is removed (for example if the string breaks) the stone moves in a straight line. In this inertial frame, the concept of centrifugal force is not required as all motion can be properly described using only real forces and Newton's laws of motion.\\r\\nIn a frame of reference rotating with the stone around the same axis as the stone, the stone is stationary. However, the force applied by the string is still acting on the stone. If one were to apply Newton's laws in their usual (inertial frame) form, one would conclude that the stone should accelerate in the direction of the net applied force--towards the axis of rotation--which it does not do. The centrifugal force and other fictitious forces must be included along with the real forces in order to apply Newton's laws of motion in the rotating frame.\\r\\nThe Earth, because it rotates once a day on its axis, constitutes a rotating reference frame. Because the rotation is slow, the fictitious forces it produces are small, and in everyday situations can generally be neglected. Even in calculations requiring high precision, the centrifugal force is generally not explicitly included, but rather lumped in with the gravitational force: the strength and direction of the local \\"gravity\\" at any point on the Earth's surface is actually a combination of gravitational and centrifugal forces.\\r\\nIf an object is weighed with a simple spring balance at one of the Earth's poles, there are two forces acting on the object: the Earth's gravity, which acts in a downward direction, and the equal and opposite tension in the spring, acting upward. There is no net force acting on the object and the spring balance so the object does not accelerate and remains stationary. The balance shows the value of the force of gravity on the object.\\r\\nWhen the same object is weighed on the equator the same two real forces act upon the object. However, the object is moving in a circular path as the Earth rotates. When considered in an inertial frame (that is to say, one that is not rotating with the Earth), some of the force of gravity is expended just to keep the object in its circular path (centripetal force). Less tension in the spring is required to counteract the 'remaining' force of gravity. Less tension in the spring would be reflected on a scale as less weight  about 0.3% less at the equator than at the poles.[9] In the Earth reference frame (in which the object being weighed is at rest), this difference is explained by the centrifugal force.\\r\\nNote: In fact, the observed weight difference is more  about 0.53%. Earth's gravity is a bit stronger at the poles than at the equator, because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, so an object at the poles is slightly closer to the center of the Earth than one at the equator; this effect combines with the centrifugal force to produce the observed weight difference.[10]\\r\\nThis thought experiment is more complicated than the previous examples in that it requires the use of the Coriolis force as well as the centrifugal force.\\r\\nIf there were a railway line running round the Earth's equator, a train moving westward along it fast enough would remain stationary in a frame moving (but not rotating) with the Earth; it would stand still as the Earth spun beneath it. In this inertial frame the situation is easy to analyze. The only forces acting on the train (assuming no wind resistance or other horizontal forces) are its gravity (downward) and the equal and opposite (upward) force from the track. There is no net force on the train and it therefore remains stationary.\\r\\nIn a frame rotating with the Earth the train moves in a circular orbit as it travels round the Earth. In this frame, the upward reaction force from the track and the force of gravity on the train remain the same, as they are real forces. However, in the Earth's (rotating) frame, the train is traveling in a circular path and therefore requires a centripetal (downward) force to keep it on this path. Because this uses a rotating frame, the (fictitious) centrifugal force must be applied to the train. This is equal in value to the required centripetal force but acts in an upward direction  the opposite direction to that required. It would seem that there is a net upward force on the train and it should therefore accelerate upward.\\r\\nThe resolution to this paradox lies in the fact that the train is in motion with respect to the rotating frame and is subject to (in addition to the centrifugal force) the Coriolis force, which, in this example, acts downward direction and is twice as strong as centrifugal force.\\r\\nFor the following formalism, the rotating frame of reference is regarded as a special case of a non-inertial reference frame that is rotating relative to an inertial reference frame denoted the stationary frame.\\r\\nIn a rotating frame of reference, the time derivatives of any vector function P of timesuch as the velocity and acceleration vectors of an objectwill differ from its time derivatives in the stationary frame. If P1 P2, P3 are the components of P with respect to unit vectors i, j, k directed along the axes of the rotating frame,[11] then the first time derivative [dP/dt] of P with respect to the rotating frame is, by definition, dP1/dt i + dP2/dt j + dP3/dt k. If the absolute angular velocity of the rotating frame is  then the derivative dP/dt of P with respect to the stationary frame is related to [dP/dt] by the equation:[12]\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\times }\\r\\n\\r\\n denotes the vector cross product. In other words, the rate of change of P in the stationary frame is the sum of its apparent rate of change in the rotating frame and a rate of rotation \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\omega }}\\\\times {\\\\boldsymbol {P}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n attributable to the motion of the rotating frame. The vector  has magnitude  equal to the rate of rotation and is directed along the axis of rotation according to the right-hand rule.\\r\\nNewton's law of motion for a particle of mass m written in vector form is:\\r\\nwhere F is the vector sum of the physical forces applied to the particle and a is the absolute acceleration (that is, acceleration in an inertial frame) of the particle, given by:\\r\\nwhere r is the position vector of the particle.\\r\\nBy applying the transformation above from the stationary to the rotating frame three times,[13] the absolute acceleration of the particle can be written as:\\r\\nThe apparent acceleration in the rotating frame is [d2r/dt2]. An observer unaware of the rotation would expect this to be zero in the absence of outside forces. However, Newton's laws of motion apply only in the inertial frame and describe dynamics in terms of the absolute acceleration d2r/dt2. Therefore, the observer perceives the extra terms as contributions due to fictitious forces. These terms in the apparent acceleration are independent of mass; so it appears that each of these fictitious forces, like gravity, pulls on an object in proportion to its mass. When these forces are added, the equation of motion has the form:[14][15][16]\\r\\nFrom the perspective of the rotating frame, the additional force terms are experienced just like the real external forces and contribute to the apparent acceleration.[17][18] The additional terms on the force side of the equation can be recognized as, reading from left to right, the Euler force \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nm\\r\\nd\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n?\\r\\nt\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle -m\\\\operatorname {d} {\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\omega }}/\\\\operatorname {d} t\\\\times {\\\\boldsymbol {r}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n, the Coriolis force \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n2\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n[\\r\\nd\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n?\\r\\nt\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle -2m{\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\omega }}\\\\times \\\\left[\\\\operatorname {d} {\\\\boldsymbol {r}}/\\\\operatorname {d} t\\\\right]}\\r\\n\\r\\n, and the centrifugal force \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle -m{\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\omega }}\\\\times ({\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\omega }}\\\\times {\\\\boldsymbol {r}})}\\r\\n\\r\\n, respectively.[19] Unlike the other two fictitious forces, the centrifugal force always points radially outward from the axis of rotation of the rotating frame, with magnitude m2r, and unlike the Coriolis force in particular, it is independent of the motion of the particle in the rotating frame. As expected, for a non-rotating inertial frame of reference \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n0\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle ({\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\omega }}=0)}\\r\\n\\r\\n the centrifugal force and all other fictitious forces disappear.[20]\\r\\nThree scenarios were suggested by Newton to answer the question of whether the absolute rotation of a local frame can be detected; that is, if an observer can decide whether an observed object is rotating or if the observer is rotating.[21][22]\\r\\nIn these scenarios, the effects attributed to centrifugal force are only observed in the local frame (the frame in which the object is stationary) if the object is undergoing absolute rotation relative to an inertial frame. By contrast, in an inertial frame, the observed effects arise as a consequence of the inertia and the known forces without the need to introduce a centrifugal force. Based on this argument, the privileged frame, wherein the laws of physics take on the simplest form, is a stationary frame in which no fictitious forces need to be invoked.\\r\\nWithin this view of physics, any other phenomenon that is usually attributed to centrifugal force can be used to identify absolute rotation. For example, the oblateness of a sphere of freely flowing material is often explained in terms of centrifugal force. The oblate spheroid shape reflects, following Clairaut's theorem, the balance between containment by gravitational attraction and dispersal by centrifugal force. That the Earth is itself an oblate spheroid, bulging at the equator where the radial distance and hence the centrifugal force is larger, is taken as one of the evidences for its absolute rotation.[23]\\r\\nThe operations of numerous common rotating mechanical systems are most easily conceptualized in terms of centrifugal force. For example:\\r\\nNevertheless, all of these systems can also be described without requiring the concept of centrifugal force, in terms of motions and forces in a stationary frame, at the cost of taking somewhat more care in the consideration of forces and motions within the system.\\r\\nThe conception of centrifugal force has evolved since the time of Huygens, Newton, Leibniz, and Hooke who expressed early conceptions of it. Its modern conception as a fictitious force arising in a rotating reference frame evolved in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.[citation needed]\\r\\nCentrifugal force has also played a role in debates in classical mechanics about detection of absolute motion. Newton suggested two arguments to answer the question of whether absolute rotation can be detected: the rotating bucket argument, and the rotating spheres argument.[25] According to Newton, in each scenario the centrifugal force would be observed in the object's local frame (the frame where the object is stationary) only if the frame were rotating with respect to absolute space. Nearly two centuries later, Mach's principle was proposed where, instead of absolute rotation, the motion of the distant stars relative to the local inertial frame gives rise through some (hypothetical) physical law to the centrifugal force and other inertia effects. Today's view is based upon the idea of an inertial frame of reference, which privileges observers for which the laws of physics take on their simplest form, and in particular, frames that do not use centrifugal forces in their equations of motion in order to describe motions correctly.\\r\\nThe analogy between centrifugal force (sometimes used to create artificial gravity) and gravitational forces led to the equivalence principle of general relativity.[26][27]\\r\\nWhile the majority of the scientific literature uses the term centrifugal force to refer to the particular fictitious force that arises in rotating frames, there are a few limited instances in the literature of the term applied to other distinct physical concepts. One of these instances occurs in Lagrangian mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics formulates mechanics in terms of generalized coordinates {qk}, which can be as simple as the usual polar coordinates \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\nr\\r\\n,\\r\\n?\\r\\nĲ\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle (r,\\\\ \\\\theta )}\\r\\n\\r\\n or a much more extensive list of variables.[28][29] Within this formulation the motion is described in terms of generalized forces, using in place of Newton's laws the EulerÿLagrange equations. Among the generalized forces, those involving the square of the time derivatives {(dqk?????dt?)2} are sometimes called centrifugal forces.[30][31][32][33] In the case of motion in a central potential the Lagrangian centrifugal force has the same form as the fictitious centrifugal force derived in a co-rotating frame.[34] However, the Lagrangian use of \\"centrifugal force\\" in other, more general cases has only a limited connection to the Newtonian definition.\\r\\nIn another instance the term refers to the reaction force to a centripetal force, or reactive centrifugal force. A body undergoing curved motion, such as circular motion, is accelerating toward a center at any particular point in time. This centripetal acceleration is provided by a centripetal force, which is exerted on the body in curved motion by some other body. In accordance with Newton's third law of motion, the body in curved motion exerts an equal and opposite force on the other body. This reactive force is exerted by the body in curved motion on the other body that provides the centripetal force and its direction is from that other body toward the body in curved motion.[35][36] [37][38]\\r\\nThis reaction force is sometimes described as a centrifugal inertial reaction,[39][40] that is, a force that is centrifugally directed, which is a reactive force equal and opposite to the centripetal force that is curving the path of the mass.\\r\\nThe concept of the reactive centrifugal force is sometimes used in mechanics and engineering. It is sometimes referred to as just centrifugal force rather than as reactive centrifugal force[41][42] although this usage is deprecated in elementary mechanics.[43]","input":"What is the centrifugal force of the earth?"},{"output":"Belize","context":"Central America (Spanish: Amrica Central or Centroamrica) is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with the South American continent on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate)[2] and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).[3]\\r\\nCentral America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property.\\r\\nIn the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central Americaexcept for the lands that would become Belize and Panamawas governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981). Even today, though, people in Central America sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a Central American state (e.g. it is still common to write \\"C.A.\\" after the country names, in formal and informal contexts).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Central America\\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:\\r\\nIn the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some[11] culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.\\r\\nFollowing Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petn Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms ÿ the Kowoj and the Itza people ÿ were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petn.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real de Guatemala. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.\\r\\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of C܇rdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\\r\\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Los Altos, Mosquito Coast, and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see History of Belize (1506ÿ1862). Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.[citation needed]\\r\\nPanama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa F de Bogot. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase Banana Republic. [12]\\r\\nAfter more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation. Poverty, social injustice and violence are still widespread.[13] Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere (only Haiti is poorer).[14]\\r\\nCentral America is the tapering isthmus of southern North America, with unique and varied geographic features. The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico lies to the north. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America,[7] while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Isthmus of Panama, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.\\r\\nOf the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At 4,220 meters (13,850?ft), Volcn Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:\\r\\nHigh points in Central America\\r\\nBetween the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.[15]\\r\\nTrade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.[16]\\r\\nCentral America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity.[17] The Pacific Flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropic ecozones. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity.[17] The table below shows recent statistics:\\r\\nBiodiversity in Central America (number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants)\\r\\nOver 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.[25]\\r\\nEfforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected.[26] A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species. So far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.[27]\\r\\nFrom 2001 to 2010, 5,376 square kilometers (2,076?sq?mi) of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with 12,201 square kilometers (4,711?sq?mi). Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers (1,830?sq?mi), and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers (793?sq?mi). Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers (3,310?sq?mi) of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers (1,180?sq?mi) of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.[28]\\r\\nThe Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of 111,400 square kilometers (43,000?sq?mi),[29] extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between 600ÿ1,800 metres (2,000ÿ5,900?ft) elevation,[29] and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above 1,800 metres (5,900?ft) are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.\\r\\nLaurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than 1,000 meters (3,300?ft) above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, and species of Weinmannia, Drimys, and Magnolia.[30] The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarn and Volcn Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.\\r\\nThe Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund.[31] These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800ÿ4,000 metres (5,900ÿ13,100?ft), on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers (5,100?sq?mi) and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.[31]\\r\\nEcoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America.[30] The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.\\r\\nCentral America is geologically very active, with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring frequently, and tsunamis occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.\\r\\nMost of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some 60ÿ160 kilometers (37ÿ99?mi) off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.[32] For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.\\r\\nThe Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.\\r\\nAnother onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly 80 kilometers (50?mi) to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.[33]\\r\\nManagua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.\\r\\nVolcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.\\r\\nThe population of Central America is estimated at 47,448,333 as of 2016.[34] With an area of 523,780 square kilometers (202,230?sq?mi),[2] it has a population density of 81 per square kilometer (210/sq?mi).\\r\\nThe official language majority in all Central American countries is Spanish, except in Belize, where the official language is English. Mayan languages constitute a language family consisting of about 26 related languages. Guatemala formally recognized 21 of these in 1996. Xinca and Garifuna are also present in Central America.\\r\\nThis region of the continent is very rich in terms of ethnic groups. The majority of the population is mestizo, with sizable Mayan and White populations present, including Xinca and Garifuna minorities. The immigration of Arabs, Jews, Chinese, Europeans and others brought additional groups to the area.\\r\\nThe predominant religion in Central America is Christianity (95.6%).[36] Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Central America in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism became the most popular religion in the region until the first half of the 20th century. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion.[37]\\r\\nSistema de Integraci܇n Centroamericana\\r\\nCentral American Integration System\\r\\nMotto: \\"Peace, Development, Liberty and Democracy\\"\\r\\nAnthem: La Granadera\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral America is currently undergoing a process of political, economic and cultural transformation that started in 1907 with the creation of the Central American Court of Justice.\\r\\nIn 1951 the integration process continued with the signature of the San Salvador Treaty, which created the ODECA, the Organization of Central American States. However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.\\r\\nIn 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the Central American Integration System (Sistema para la Integraci܇n Centroamericana, or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the Dominican Republic, a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.\\r\\nOn 6 December 2008 SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.[citation needed] No timeline for implementation was discussed.\\r\\nCentral America already has several supranational institutions such as the Central American Parliament, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and the Central American Common Market.\\r\\nOn 22 July 2011 President Mauricio Funes of El Salvador became the first president pro tempore to SICA. El Salvador also became the headquarters of SICA with the inauguration of a new building.[38]\\r\\nUntil recently, all Central American countries have maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan instead of China. President ܇scar Arias of Costa Rica, however, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007, severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.[39] After breaking off relations with the Republic of China in 2017, Panama established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.[40]\\r\\nThe Central American Parliament (also known as PARLACEN) is a political and parliamentary body of SICA. The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.\\r\\nSigned in 2004, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. The treaty is aimed at promoting free trade among its members.\\r\\nGuatemala has the largest economy in the region.[41][42] Its main exports are coffee, sugar, bananas, petroleum, clothing, and cardamom. Of its 10.29 billion dollar annual exports,[43] 40.2% go to the United States, 11.1% to neighboring El Salvador, 8% to Honduras, 5.5% to Mexico, 4.7% to Nicaragua, and 4.3% to Costa Rica.[44]\\r\\nEconomic growth in Central America is projected to slow slightly in 2014ÿ15, as country-specific domestic factors offset the positive effects from stronger economic activity in the United States.[9]\\r\\nTourism in Belize has grown considerably in more recent times, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Belizean Prime Minister Dean Barrow has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country.[47] The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Belize's tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming almost one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2012.[48] Belize is also the only country in Central America with English as its official language, making this country a comfortable destination for English-speaking tourists.[49]\\r\\nCosta Rica is the most visited nation in Central America.[50] Tourism in Costa Rica is one of the fastest growing economic sectors of the country,[51] having become the largest source of foreign revenue by 1995.[52] Since 1999, tourism has earned more foreign exchange than bananas, pineapples and coffee exports combined.[53] The tourism boom began in 1987,[52] with the number of visitors up from 329,000 in 1988, through 1.03 million in 1999, to a historical record of 2.43 million foreign visitors and $1.92-billion in revenue in 2013.[50] In 2012 tourism contributed with 12.5% of the country's GDP and it was responsible for 11.7% of direct and indirect employment.[54]\\r\\nTourism in Nicaragua has grown considerably recently, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country.[55] The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Nicaragua's tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2010.[56]\\r\\nThe Inter-American Highway is the Central American section of the Pan-American Highway, and spans 5,470 kilometers (3,400?mi) between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Panama City, Panama. Because of the 87 kilometers (54?mi) break in the highway known as the Darin Gap, it is not possible to cross between Central America and South America in an automobile.","input":"What is the only country in central america that doesn't speak spanish?"},{"output":"A red Burgundy wine","context":"Coq au vin (/?k?k o? ?v??/;[1] French:?[k?k o v??], \\"rooster/cock with wine\\") is a French dish of chicken braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and optionally garlic.  \\r\\nA red Burgundy wine is typically used,[2] though many regions of France make variants using local varietals, such as coq au vin jaune (Jura), coq au Riesling (Alsace), coq au pourpre or coq au violet (Beaujolais nouveau), coq au Champagne, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious legends trace coq au vin to ancient Gaul and Julius Caesar, but the recipe was not documented until the early 20th century;[3] it is generally accepted that it existed as a rustic dish long before that.[2] A somewhat similar recipe, poulet au vin blanc, appeared in an 1864 cookbook.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia Child included coq au vin in her 1961 cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking,[5] and she prepared it twice on the PBS cooking show The French Chef.

It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of the strongest UEFA national associations. The UEFA Champions League final is the most watched annual sporting event worldwide. The final of the 2012ÿ13 tournament had the highest TV ratings to date, drawing 360?million television viewers.[1]\\r\\nIntroduced in 1992, the competition replaced the European Champion Clubs' Cup, or simply European Cup, which had run since 1955, adding a group stage to the competition and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries.[2] The pre-1992 competition was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champion club of each country. During the 1990s, the format was expanded, incorporating a round-robin group stage to include clubs that finished runner-up of some nations' top-level league.[2] While most of Europe's national leagues can still only enter their national league champion, Europe's strongest national leagues now provide up to five teams for the competition.[3][4] Clubs that finish next-in-line in each nation's top level league, having not qualified for the UEFA Champions League competition, are eligible for the next-level UEFA Europa League competition.\\r\\nIn its present format, the UEFA Champions League begins in mid-July with three knockout qualifying rounds and a play-off round. The 10 surviving teams enter the group stage, joining 22 other teams qualified in advance. The 32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each other in a double round-robin system. The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in May.[5] The winner of the UEFA Champions League qualifies for the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[6][7]\\r\\nReal Madrid is the most successful club in the competition's history, having won the tournament 13 times, including its first five seasons. Spanish clubs have accumulated the highest number of victories (18 wins), followed by England and Italy (12 wins apiece). England has the largest number of different winning teams, with five clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 22 different clubs, 12 of which have won it more than once.[8] The reigning champions are Real Madrid, who secured their 13th title in the competition after defeating Liverpool 3ÿ1 in the 2018 final. Thus, they became the first team in the UEFA Champions League era to win the title for three years in a row.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[9] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[10] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[11] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by ~jpest of Hungary.[11] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[12] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful Campeonato Sudamericano de Campeones of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'quipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[13] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \\"Champions of the World\\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3ÿ2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[2] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[2]\\r\\nThe first edition of the European Cup took place during the 1955ÿ56 season.[14][15] Sixteen teams participated: Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurg?rden (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrcken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Stade de Reims (France), and V?r?s Lobog܇ (Hungary).[14][15] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3ÿ3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[14][15] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by Jo?o Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[14][15] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid.[14][15][16] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4ÿ3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Hctor Rial.[14][15][16]\\r\\nReal Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabu, against Fiorentina.[17][18] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[16][17][18] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[19][20] The final held in Heysel Stadium went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[16][19][20] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1958ÿ59 season final, easily winning 2ÿ0.[16][21][22] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first non-Latin team to reach the European Cup final.[23][24] The 1959ÿ60 season finale still holds the record for the most goals scored, but the record is overshadowed by the 7ÿ3 thrashing Eintracht Frankfurt received in Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Pusks and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stfano.[16][23][24] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[8]\\r\\nLos Merengues reign ended in the 1960ÿ61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[25][26] Barcelona themselves, however, would be defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3ÿ2 at Wankdorf Stadium.[25][26][27] Reinforced by Eusbio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5ÿ3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second, consecutive season.[27][28][29] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962ÿ63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian Jos Altafini at the Wembley Stadium gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[30][31][32] Internazionale beat an ageing-Real Madrid 3ÿ1 in the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963ÿ64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[33][34][35] The title stayed in the city of Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1ÿ0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \\"Champions League\\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[39][40] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[39] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French. The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus. For the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final in Rome, tenor Andrea Bocelli sang backing lyrics to the Champions League anthem, whilst similarly Juan Diego Fl܇rez provided the tenor for the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final. Girl band All Angels performed at the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final. Jonas Kaufmann provided the tenor for 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, whilst David Garrett performed with his violin. The anthem has never been released commercially in its original version.\\r\\nIn 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help \\"brand\\" the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \\"house colours\\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \\"starball\\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[41] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \\"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \\"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\\".[42]\\r\\nSince 2009ÿ10 season, the UEFA Champions League begins with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2ndÿ4th in their national championship.\\r\\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and UEFA Europa League/UEFA Cup seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\\r\\nFive of the remaining ten qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 40 or 39 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other five are granted to the winners of a two-round qualifying tournament between the 15 clubs from the associations ranked 1 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third, or fourth in their respective national league.\\r\\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.\\r\\nIn 2005ÿ06 season, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. In 2008ÿ09 season, both BATE Borisov and Anorthosis Famagusta achieved the same feat. Real Madrid holds the record for the most consecutive appearances in the group stage, having qualified 21 times in a row (1997ÿpresent). They are followed by Arsenal on 19 (1998ÿ2016)[43] and Manchester United on 18 (1996ÿ2013).[44]\\r\\nBetween 2003 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with different teams starting in different rounds.\\r\\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[45] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015ÿ16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[46] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011ÿ12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012ÿ13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[47] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012ÿ13 UEFA Europa League.[47]\\r\\nIn May 2013,[48] it was decided that, starting from the 2015ÿ16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017ÿ18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased from four to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[49]\\r\\nThe top three leagues in Europe are allowed to enter four teams into the Champions League. Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the top three leagues and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[50] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[51]\\r\\nIn 2012, Arsne Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champion's League by finishing in the top four places in the English Premier League as the \\"4th Place Trophy\\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \\"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\\".[52] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \\"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\\"[53]\\r\\nThe tournament proper begins with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups. Seeding is used whilst making the draw for this stage, whilst teams from the same country may not be drawn into groups together. Each team meets the others in its group home and away in a round-robin format. The winning team and the runners-up from each group then progress to the next round. The third-placed team enters the UEFA Europa League.\\r\\nFor this stage, the winning team from one group plays against the runners-up from another group, and teams from the same association may not be drawn against each other. From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw is entirely random, without association protection. The tournament uses the away goals rule: if the aggregate score of the two games is tied, then the team who scored more goals at their opponent's stadium advances.[54]\\r\\nThe group stage is played from September to December, whilst the knock-out stage starts in February. The knock-out ties are played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. This is typically held in the final two weeks of May.\\r\\nStarting with the 2015ÿ16 edition, the holders of the UEFA Europa League enter the Champions League, initially at the playoff round. The maximum number of teams that an association can field in the tournament has also been increased from four to five.[55]\\r\\nIn August 2016, UEFA announced changes in the access list of the tournament, driven to avoid the creation of European Super League. The top four clubs from the four top-ranked national associations will receive guaranteed qualification automatically for the group stage. The Europa League holders also will automatically qualify for the group stage.[56] However, the plan passed by UEFA caused outrage among smaller associations. After his election as the new UEFA president, Aleksander ?eferin said that he would review the new system.[57] In December 2016, UEFA confirmed the plan will go on.[58]\\r\\nThe UEFA Refereeing Unit is broken down into five experience-based categories. A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.[59]\\r\\nIn co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed and/or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.[59]\\r\\nSince 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness. Today, UEFA Champions League referees are required to pass a fitness test even to be considered at the international level.[59]\\r\\nEach year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. Any team that wins the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall wins the right to retain a full-sized replica of the trophy (UEFA retains the original at all times). Six clubs have earned this honour: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan, Liverpool and Barcelona.[60] Since then instead the club which wins three years in a row or five overall receives a conmemorative badge to wear permanently on their uniform.\\r\\nThe current trophy is 74?cm (29?in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11?kg (24?lb). It was designed by J?rg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs.\\r\\nAs of the 2012ÿ13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[61]\\r\\nAs of 2018ÿ19, the fixed amount of prize money paid to the clubs is as follows:[62]\\r\\nThis means that at best, a club can earn ?82,450,000 of prize money under this structure, not counting shares of the qualifying rounds, play-off round and/or the market pool.\\r\\nA large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \\"market pool\\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each country. For the 2014ÿ15 season, Juventus, who were the runners-up, earned nearly ?89.1?million in total, of which ?30.9?million was prize money, compared with the ?61.0?million earned by Barcelona, who won the tournament and were awarded ?36.4?million in prize money.[63]\\r\\nLike the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[64]\\r\\nFrom the 2012ÿ13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knock-out participant stadiums, including the final stage. From the 2015ÿ16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[65]\\r\\nThe tournament's current main sponsors are:[66]\\r\\nAdidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, the Adidas Finale, and referee uniform.[74] Hublot is also a secondary sponsor as the official fourth official board of the competition. [75]\\r\\nIndividual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only one sponsorship is permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer. Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[76]\\r\\nIf clubs play a match in a country where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French sides Auxerre and Strasbourg in the 1996ÿ97 Champions League and the UEFA Cup, respectively, Rangers players wore the logo of Center Parcs instead of McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[77]\\r\\nThe competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[78] The 2013 final was the most watched final to date, drawing 360?million television viewers.[1]\\r\\nThe table below does not include goals scored in the qualification stage of the competition.\\r\\nThe table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition.

In chronological order, the Reds have played their home games in the Bank Street Grounds, League Park, the Palace of the Fans, Redland Field (later known as Crosley Field), and Riverfront Stadium (later known as Cinergy Field).[1] Since 2003, the Reds have played their home games at Great American Ball Park.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been sixty-one different managers in the team's franchise history: four while it was known as the Cincinnati Red Stockings (1882ÿ1889), four while it was known as the Cincinnati Redlegs (1953ÿ1958) and the other fifty-three under the Cincinnati Reds (1882ÿ1952, 1959ÿpresent).

This is traditionally dated between 1050 and 930 BCE. On the succession of Solomon's son, Rehoboam, around 930 BCE, the biblical account reports that the country split into two kingdoms; the Kingdom of Israel (including the cities of Shechem and Samaria) in the north and the Kingdom of Judah (containing Jerusalem) in the south.\\r\\nModern historians are divided on the historicity of the United Monarchy as described in the Bible.[5] There is little extrabiblical evidence of a United Kingdom of Judah and Israel in the 10th century BCE.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to standard source criticism, a number of distinct source texts were spliced together to produce the current books of Samuel.[8] The most prominent in the early parts of the first book are the pro-monarchical source and the anti-monarchical source. In identifying these two sources, two separate accounts can be reconstructed. The anti-monarchical source describes Samuel to have thoroughly routed the Philistines, yet begrudgingly accepting that the people demanded a ruler, and thus appointing Saul by cleromancy.\\r\\nThe pro-monarchical source describes the divinely appointed birth of Saul (a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel instead), and his later leading of an army to victory over the Ammonites, which resulted in the people clamouring for him to lead them against the Philistines, whereupon he is appointed king.[9]\\r\\nTextual critics also point to disparities in the account of David's rise to power as indicative of separate threads being merged later to create a golden age of a united monarchy. David is thought by scholars to have been a ruler in Judah while Israel, comparatively immense and highly developed, continued unfettered. Modern archaeology also supports this view.[6]\\r\\nMost scholars believe the Books of Samuel exhibit too many anachronisms to have been a contemporary account. For example, there is mention of later armor (1 Samuel 17:4ÿ7, 38ÿ39; 25:13), use of camels (1 Samuel 30:17), cavalry (as distinct from chariotry) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard this conquest as legendary in origin, particularly given the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples. Most scholars believe that Samuel was compiled in the 8th century BCE (rather than the 10th century where most of the events described take place) based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in Deuteronomy. This gap in historical record is characteristic of the Late Bronze Age collapse; cultural memories of times before the disaster often became embellished as stories of a \\"lost golden age\\", e.g. the Trojan Epic Cycle.\\r\\nAccording to the Book of Judges, before the united monarchy Israelite tribes lived as a confederation under ad hoc charismatic leaders called Judges. Abimelech was the first judge to be declared king by the men of Shechem and the house of Millo,[10] and reigned over Israel for three years before he was killed during the Battle of Thebez.[11]\\r\\nAccording to the biblical account, the united monarchy was formed when there was a large popular expression in favour of introducing a king to rule over the decentralised Israelite confederacy. Increasing pressure from the Philistines and other neighboring peoples is said by the Bible to have forced the Israelites to unite as a more singular state when Samuel anointed Saul from the tribe of Benjamin as the first king. The Bible treats the notion of kingship as having been an anathema at the time, it being seen as one man put in a position of reverence and power, which in their faith was reserved for God.\\r\\nAccording to the Second Book of Samuel, due to his disobedience to God, Saul's reign was curtailed and his kingdom given to another dynasty. The Masoretic Text says that Saul ruled for only two years.[12] The Bible portrays Saul as having died in battle against the Philistines.\\r\\nDavid and Saul had earlier become bitter enemies, at least from Saul's point of view, although the sources describe Jonathan, Saul's son, and Michal, Saul's daughter, as assisting David to escape Saul, ultimately leading to a brief reconciliation before Saul's death.\\r\\nSaul's heir, Ishbaal, took over rulership of Israel but, according to Samuel, ruled for only two years before he was assassinated. David, who had become king of Judah only, ended the conspiracy, and was appointed king of Israel in Ishbaal's place. A number of textual critics and biblical scholars have suggested that David was actually responsible for the assassination, and David's innocence was a later invention to legitimize his actions.[13]\\r\\nIsrael rebels, according to Samuel, and appoints David's son Absalom as their new king. The Bible then describes Israel as taking over Judah and ultimately forcing David into exile east of the Jordan. According to the increasing majority of archaeologists, this isn't so much a case of rebellion by Israel against a mighty kingdom, but more a case of Israel re-asserting its authority over a poor, rural, sparsely populated, backwater.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis section of the biblical text, and the bulk of the remainder of the Books of Samuel, is thought by textual critics to belong to a single large source known as the Court History of David. Although reflecting the political bias of the later kingdom of Judah after Israel's destruction, the source is somewhat more neutral than the pro and anti monarchical sources that form earlier parts of the text. Israel and Judah are portrayed in this source as quite distinct kingdoms.\\r\\nEventually, according to the Book of Samuel, David launches a counter-attack, and wins, although with the loss of Absalom. After having retaken Judah, as well as asserted control over Israel, David returns to the west of the Jordan, although he continues to suffer a number of rebellions by Israel, successfully suppressing each one.\\r\\nAccording to the biblical account, it was David who, following a civil war with Saul, created a strong and unified Israelite monarchy, reigning c. 1000ÿ961 BCE.[14] Solomon, David's successor, maintained the unified monarchy, c. 961ÿ922.[14]\\r\\nDavid, the Second King of Israel, established Jerusalem as its national capital in 1006 BCE.[15] Before then, Hebron had been the capital of David's Judah and Mahanaim of Ish-baal's Israel, and before that Gibeah had been the capital of the United Monarchy under Saul. Earlier parts of the Bible indicate that Shiloh had been seen as the national capital; which, from an archaeological standpoint, is considered plausible, as far as it being the religious capital.\\r\\nIn the biblical account, David finally succeeds in truly unifying Judah and Israel. Some modern archaeologists believe there was a continued and uninterrupted existence of two distinct cultures and geographic entities, one being Judah, the other Israel, and if there was a political union it possibly had no practical effect on the relationship between the two nations.[6]\\r\\nDavid embarked on successful military campaigns against Judah's and Israel's enemies, and defeated nearby regional entities such as the Philistines, thus creating secure borders. Israel grew from Kingdom to Empire, and its sphere of influence ÿ militarily and politically ÿ in the Middle East expanded greatly, controlling a number of weaker client states like Philistia, Moab, Edom and Ammon, with a number of Aramaean city-states (Aram-Zobah and Aram-Damascus) becoming vassal states;[16] the imperial border stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Desert, from the Red Sea to the Euphrates River. Some modern archaeologists believe that the area under the control of Judah and Israel in this era, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not exceed 34,000 square kilometres (13,000 sq mi); of these, the kingdom of Israel encompassed about 24,000 square kilometres (9,300?sq?mi).[citation needed]\\r\\nDavid was succeeded on his death by his son, Solomon, who obtained the kingdom in a somewhat disreputable manner from the rival claimant, his elder brother Adonijah, whom he later had killed. Living up to his name (peace), the rule of Solomon was one in which the nation knew unprecedented peace.\\r\\nUnder Solomon, the United Monarchy experienced a period of peace and prosperity, and cultural development. Much public building took place, including the First Temple in Jerusalem.\\r\\nDavid and Solomon are both portrayed by the Bible as having entered into strong alliances with the King of Tyre. In return for ceding land to Tyre, David and Solomon are said to have received a number of master craftsmen, skilled labourers, money, jewels, cedar, and other goods. David's Palace and Solomon's Temple are described as having been built with the assistance of these Tyrian assets, as well as to designs given by architects from Tyre.\\r\\nSolomon is said to have rebuilt a number of major cities, including Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer; these have been excavated and some scholars attributed elements of the archaeological remains, such as six chambered gates and ashlar palaces, to this building programme. However, later excavation teams at Meggido have made it clear that these structures are from different and later time periods. Yigael Yadin subsequently concluded that the stables that were once believed to have served the vast collection of horses that Solomon is believed to have kept, were actually built by King Ahab in the 9th century BCE.[17]\\r\\nFollowing Solomon's death in c. 926 BCE, tensions between the northern part of Israel containing the ten northern tribes, and the southern section dominated by Jerusalem and the southern tribes reached boiling point. When Solomon's successor Rehoboam dealt tactlessly with economic complaints of the northern tribes, in about 930 BCE (there are differences of opinion as to the actual year) the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah split into two kingdoms: the northern Kingdom of Israel, which included the cities of Shechem and Samaria, and the southern Kingdom of Judah, which contained Jerusalem; with most of the non-Israelite provinces achieving independence.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Israel (or Northern Kingdom, or Samaria) existed as an independent state until 722 BCE when it was conquered by the Assyrian Empire, while the Kingdom of Judah (or Southern Kingdom) existed as an independent state until 586 BCE when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\\r\\nMany alternative chronologies have been suggested, and there is no ultimate consensus between the different factions and scholarly disciplines concerned with this period, as to when it began or when it ended.[18][19][20]\\r\\nMost historians follow either of the older chronologies established by William F. Albright or Edwin R. Thiele, or the newer chronology of Gershon Galil, all of which are shown below. All dates are BCE. Thiele's chronology generally corresponds with Galil's chronology below with a difference of at most one year.[21]\\r\\nHouse of Saul\\r\\nHouse of David\\r\\nThe question of the existence of archeological evidence for the united monarchy is debated in contemporary scholarship. It is generally accepted that a \\"House of David\\" existed but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development. According to Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman, authors of The Bible Unearthed, the idea of a united monarchy is not accurate history but rather \\"creative expressions of a powerful religious reform movement,\\" possibly \\"based on certain historical kernels.\\"[6] Although in a later book Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were real kings of Judah about the 10th century B.C, they cite that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel is about 890 B.C, while for that of Judah is about 750 B.C.[22] This is supported by Tubb, who argues that the United Monarchy is a created Golden Age written during the Exile.[23] He accepts the historicity of David and Solomon but cautions that \\"They must be seen, however, as local folk heroes and not as rulers of international status.\\"[23]\\r\\nKuhrt reviews the general lack of archaeological evidence for the United Monarchy and concludes: \\"there are no royal inscriptions from the time of the United Monarchy (indeed very little written material altogether), and not a single contemporary reference to either David or Solomon.... Against this must be set the evidence for substantial development and growth at several sites, which is plausibly related to the tenth century.\\"[7] Kenneth Kitchen reaches a similar conclusion in his review of the evidence, arguing that \\"the physical archaeology of tenth-century Canaan is consistent with the former existence of a unified state on its terrain\\".[24]\\r\\nExcavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, an Iron Age site located in Judah, found an urbanized settlement radio-carbon dated well before scholars such as Finklestein suggest urbanization began in Judah, supporting existence of a Judahite kingdom. The Israel Antiquities Authority stated: \\"The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.\\"[25]\\r\\nIn August 2015, Israeli archaeologists discovered massive fortifications in the ruins of the ancient city of Gath, the supposed birthplace of Goliath. The size of the fortifications show Gath to be a very large city in the 10th century BCE, perhaps the largest in Canaan at the time. The professor leading the dig, Aren Maeir, estimated that Gath was as much as four times the size of contemporary Jerusalem, casting doubt that David's kingdom could have been as powerful as described in the Bible.[26]\\r\\n\\"The name ... signifies the people composed of [Jacob's] descendants (the 'children of Israel'), being applied (a) to the whole people (including Judah) ...

It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\\r\\nConstructed from 1887ÿ89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91?million people ascended it in 2015.\\r\\nThe tower is 324 metres (1,063?ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410?ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17?ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second-tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\\r\\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276?m (906?ft) above the ground ÿ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des tablissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[4] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \\"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\\".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\\r\\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socit des Ingnieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise,\\r\\nNot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[6]\\r\\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grvy was re-elected as president of France and douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300?m (980?ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[6] (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\\r\\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[7]\\r\\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \\"Committee of Three Hundred\\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \\"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:\\r\\nWe, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection  of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower  To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years  we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.[8]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \\"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\\"[9] These criticisms were also dealt with by douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,[10] \\"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\\r\\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \\"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\\"[11]\\r\\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[12] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[13]\\r\\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.[14] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.\\r\\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[15] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2?m (6.6?ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15?m (49?ft) long and 6?m (20?ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22?m (72?ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6?m (20?ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\\r\\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10?cm (4?in) in diameter and 7.5?m (25?ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[17] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 0.1?mm (0.0039?in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5?million rivets.[15]\\r\\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \\"Eiffel Suicide!\\" and \\"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\\" appeared in the tabloid press.[18] At this stage, a small \\"creeper\\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.[15] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[15] only one person died thanks to Eiffel's stringent safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens.\\r\\nThe start of the erection of the metalwork.\\r\\n7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\\r\\n20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\\r\\n15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\\r\\n21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\\r\\n26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\\r\\n15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola.\\r\\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[19]\\r\\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.[20] Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around 3.9?m (12?ft 10?in) diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.[20]\\r\\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[21] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\\r\\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67?m (41?ft 7?in) long and 96.5?cm (38.0?in) in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of 10.83?m (35?ft 6?in): this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\\r\\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Lon Edoux. A pair of 81?m (266?ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[22]\\r\\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.[12] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustr, completed the ascent. At 2:35?pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[23]\\r\\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[24] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[25] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\\r\\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.\\r\\nOn the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made. There was also a patisserie.\\r\\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse (\\"truly curious\\").[26]\\r\\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[24] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[27] Edison signed the guestbook with this message:\\r\\nTo M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\\r\\nEiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit.\\r\\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[28]\\r\\nFor the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[21] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.\\r\\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[29]\\r\\nMany innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[30] Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 metres) to demonstrate his parachute design.[31] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War?I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[32] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citro?n adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[citation needed] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[33]\\r\\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \\"sold\\" the tower for scrap metal.[34] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[35] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[36] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[37] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[38]\\r\\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[39] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[40] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[41] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[42] On 25 June, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[39]\\r\\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[43] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Andr Malraux.[44] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[45]\\r\\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[46]\\r\\nIn 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant.[citation needed] The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[45] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.\\r\\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[47] In 1987, A.J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[48] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Herv Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower.[49] Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor its \\"Countdown to the Year 2000\\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. Fireworks were set off all over it. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[50]\\r\\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium On 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[51]\\r\\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[52] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7?million visitors since 2003.[53] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[54] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[55]\\r\\nThe puddled iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons,[56] and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100?tons.[57] As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300?tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410?ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25?cm (2.46?in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8?tons per cubic metre.[58] Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324?m x 125?m x 125?m) would contain 6,200?tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18?cm (7?in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[59]\\r\\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team ÿ experienced bridge builders ÿ understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:\\r\\nIs it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony?  Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be  will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[60]\\r\\nHe used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[61] All parts of the tower were over-designed to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[62] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[61]\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9?centimetres (3.5?in) in the wind.[63]\\r\\nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurantsone French, one Russian and one Flemishand an \\"Anglo-American Bar\\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. A promenade 2.6-metre (8?ft 6?in) wide ran around the outside of the first level. At the top, there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.[64]\\r\\nIn May 2016, an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in Paris in June. The apartment has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a lounge, and views of Paris landmarks including the Seine, the Sacre Coeur, and the Arc de Triomphe.[65]\\r\\nThe arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.[citation needed]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \\"invocation of science\\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986ÿ87 by the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, a company operating the tower.[66]\\r\\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to perfectly complement the Parisian sky.[67] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \\"Eiffel Tower Brown\\".[68]\\r\\nThe only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.[69]\\r\\nOne of the great Hollywood movie clichs is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.[citation needed]\\r\\nMaintenance of the tower includes applying 60?tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.[51]\\r\\nThe nearest Paris Mtro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[70] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Ina.\\r\\nMore than 250?million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[3] In 2015, there were 6.91?million visitors.[71] The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.[72] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues.[73] Tickets can be purchased online to avoid the long queues.\\r\\nThe tower has two restaurants: Le 58 Tour Eiffel on the first level, and Le Jules Verne, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It is run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse[74] and owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne. Additionally, there is a champagne bar at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nAs one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1?metres (518?ft) tall.[75] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[76]\\r\\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[77]\\r\\nIn 2011, the TV show Pricing the Priceless on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480?million to build.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[79] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nA television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7?m (61.4?ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3?m (17.4?ft), giving the current height of 324?m (1,063?ft).[51] Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.\\r\\nThe tower and its image have long been in the public domain.[80] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \\"original visual creation\\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[81] The Socit d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[82] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[83][84]\\r\\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SNTE), Stphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \\"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\\".[85] SNTE made over ?1?million from copyright fees in 2002.[86] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[80]\\r\\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,[87] a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out.[88] The tower has lost its standing both as the world's tallest structure and the world's tallest lattice tower but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France.","input":"How long was the eiffel tower the tallest building in the world?"},{"output":"Sergeant","context":"In the US military, a squad leader or squad commander is a Non-Commissioned Officer who leads a squad of typically 9 Soldiers (US Army: squad leader and two fireteams of 4 men each) or 13 Marines (US Marine Corps: squad leader and three fireteams of 4 men each) in a rifle squad, or 3 to 8 men in a crew-served weapons squad.

After screen tests with co-star Kristoff St. John and casting director Marnie Saitta, Khalil was given the part.[3] In 2005 (after portraying the character for three years) Khalil left the series, citing stress as the reason for her departure.[4] The producers tried unsuccessfully to convince Khalil to stay, and recast her role with Sherwood.[5] Sherwood said that while the character Lily was the same, she and Khalil were not the same actress so it would be \\"a little different\\".[6] Although she replaced a popular actress, Sherwood said she felt no anxiety over the recasting because Khalil chose to leave the part.[7][8]\\r\\nAfter leaving the series, Khalil and the producers began discussing her possible return.[4] In 2006 she agreed to come back, and Sherwood was released from her contract.[4][5][9] Former executive producer and head writer Lynn Marie Latham said she was happy with the casting change; she was impressed by Khalil's work, saying that she is a \\"brilliant actress\\". Latham noted that Sherwood did a \\"fine job\\" as the character, but \\"shows generally prefer to have original players back when they can get them\\".[4][5] On her MySpace blog, Sherwood said she felt negativity from others on the set of the soap opera before her replacement; she was not told the reason for her firing, which she thought neither right nor fair.[9] Khalil stated in 2007 that her return was a difficult decision to make, but was \\"the best decision ever\\".[3]\\r\\nOn August 21, 2012, The Young and the Restless put out a casting call for the role of \\"Sally Tate\\", and the character description lead to speculation that it was a recast for Lily Winters and Khalil was exiting the soap.[10] On August 22, Khalil's official website confirmed that she was leaving the show due to a contract dispute and her contract was set to expire in late-September.[11] On August 23, 2012, Khalil gave an interview to MSN Entertainment in which she expressed her desire to remain on the show. Saying that she hoped she and the show could come to a mutual agreement but the show wasn't interested in negotiating with her.[12] Upon learning of her impending exit, fans of Khalil began a letter write-in, snail mail, e-mail and phone call campaign in support of her remaining on the show.[13] Fan outcry lead the show to rethink recasting the role with newly-appointed executive producer Jill Farren Phelps later saying that negotiations with Khalil had resumed and she \\"didn't yet know\\" how that would work out.[14][15] On September 6, 2012 a plane carrying a banner stating \\"Y&R Fans Want Christel Khalil as Lily Ashby\\" was flown over CBS Television City in support of Khalil.[16] Fans did a similar campaign in spring 2011 when Khalil's co-star Daniel Goddard was let go from the soap.[17] In late September, newly-appointed head writer Josh Griffith confirmed in an interview with TV Guide that contract negotiations had been resolved and Khalil would remain in the role.[18][19]\\r\\nIn 2002, when Lily was rapidly aged to a teenager, the character was designed as an \\"angst-ridden\\" heroine who struggled with \\"trauma\\";[20][21] she was also described as strong, rebellious, and sassy.[21][22] Khalil said that Lily \\"doesn't take anybody's crap\\" and \\"she's her own person\\".[21][23] Sherwood was said to have brought a \\"fire\\" to the role, and was told to use it only when necessary. She described Lily as \\"a lot like her mother\\": \\"It makes sense. She spent a lot of time with her mother growing up and she's seen how her mother reacts to certain situations when there is a problem or a dilemma.\\"[7] When Khalil returned to the role she felt that Lily had changed \\"a great deal\\" since she last played her;[4] she was more immature and although it was more fun, it was \\"definitely different\\".[2]\\r\\nIn 2009, Soap Opera Digest said that Khalil and Lily had evolved from a \\"teen star\\" into a \\"leading lady\\". Khalil described her happiness with her character's evolution, with more adult storylines and having to \\"deal with things like losing a baby or breaking off her engagement [to Cane]\\".[24] During her marital problems with Cane, Khalil described Lily as a \\"doormat\\" and \\"hopeless romantic\\", saying that her \\"daddy issues\\" were part of that.[25]\\r\\nOne of Lily's first storylines centered around her manipulation by internet predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who gives her the sexually-transmitted disease chlamydia.[20][21][26] Khalil taped public service announcements related to the story, and considered the plot one of her favorites:[26] \\"How many soaps have really covered that? The meeting on the Internet, getting an STD, it was really great stuff.\\"[2] Lily was next involved in a Romeo and Juliet-inspired romance (attracting a significant fan following) with Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), Kevin's friend.[27] Lily was said to have brought out a new side to Daniel's character, \\"taming\\" him.[28] When Khalil left the show, former head writer John F. Smith promised the character's recast would \\"bring an entirely new level\\" to Lily and Daniel's romance.[29] They fell in love and were married; the pair's popularity continued with Sherwood in the role.[30] Sherwood gave Lily more feistiness, although the character was never written as timid. Sherwood's interpretation drew comparisons to Lily's mother, Drucilla; that \\"fire\\" was brought into Daniel and Lily's relationship. Sherwood said that \\"Dru can be a little dramatic\\", and when Lily faces an issue with Daniel \\"she's not going to remain calm, she's going to do what she saw her mother do\\".[7] The actress praised the pair's storyline for not focusing on the different races of the characters.[30] Khalil was surprised by the advancement of Lily and Daniel's storyline when she returned, particularly the characters' marriage.[2] The plot ended with a social issue: Daniel's addiction to pornography.[20][31][32] Graziadei said, \\"My initial conflict was that Daniel has had so many problems with his wife that I couldn't figure out why he'd be doing this\\", and was concerned that Daniel might be seen as \\"lecherous and creepy\\". The pair tried to work through Daniel's addiction, but it ended their marriage.[33]\\r\\nLily was later written into a romance with Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) intertwined with a modeling career.[20] The couple was designed as star-crossed true loves,[34][35] and the relationship was said to add further growth to Lily's character.[36] Khalil said that Lily had been in \\"kind of an immature relationship\\" and she thought being with a \\"real man\\" would make Lily grow up and \\"start thinking about her life and situation in a different way\\" and \\"would change Lily for the better\\".[36] Goddard compared the romance to Lady Chatterley's Lover, as both characters grew and learned from the relationship.[37] Storylines for the lovers included the characters' age gap, a miscarriage and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller).[38][39] In the love-rectangle story, Chloe deceives Cane into thinking they conceived a child.[40][41] Goddard said he liked the storyline because of its originality. Love triangles and questioned paternity occur frequently in soap operas, but he felt that Maria Arena Bell made the plots fresh.[34][42] Khalil said that she \\"loved\\" the storyline and the actors in it;[43] she thought it \\"was a possibility\\" for Lily and Cane to have a happy ending, and Lily \\"can see the hope, and they can adapt and love each other in a more mature and honest way\\".[44] In 2009, the pair were married. For their wedding, Lily wore the dress her mother Drucilla (Victoria Rowell) wore at her 1995 wedding to Neil.[45][46][47] Rowell's dress was altered, at Khalil's request; she said it was an \\"old-fashioned, a typical '90s-style gown\\", and she \\"didn't really like it\\".[46] Khalil spoke with Bell and the head of the wardrobe department about updating the dress. Bell agreed; there were \\"little details\\" about the original dress she wanted to keep, and it became \\"a really beautiful dress\\".[46][47]\\r\\nIn 2010, Global BC said Lily was the love of Cane's life.[48] The following year, she divorced him after his continued lies about his faked death. However, she eventually discovered that Cane was trying to protect her and they remarried.[49] Khalil said that she never lost faith in the pair reuniting, since their romance is \\"so popular\\": \\"No matter what happens, they'll always get through it.\\"[50] Goddard noted that their relationship \\"had come full circle\\" and \\"was being done well\\".[49] About Cane and Lily's second wedding, Goddard said that Cane and Lily have \\"certainly had a lot of ups and downs\\" but he thought their fans \\"stayed true and they have expressed their desire for what they want to see\\".[49] He thought a wedding of \\"this caliber\\" would make their fans \\"very, very happy and that is what this is about\\".[49]\\r\\nLily was born into a paternity storyline, with brothers Neil or Malcolm Winters her father.[51] Her mother, Drucilla, had been dating Neil but slept with Malcolm (thinking he was Neil when she was groggy from medication).[52] The storyline continued unresolved for several years, with Neil believing he was Lily's father.[51][53] In 2006, former co-head writer Jack Smith decided to resolve Lily's paternity by revealing that Malcolm was her father.[53][54] About the storyline, Smith said:\\r\\nWell, if you think about it as a storyteller the potential for interesting drama is much more interesting if Malcolm is the biological father and not Neil. If Neil was the biological father, the whole sub textual romantic potential between Drucilla and Malcolm fades away. The relationship between Lily and Malcolm becomes your normal, traditional uncle/niece relationship. The relationship between Neil and Lily becomes your typical father/daughter relationship. But if Malcolm is the biological father then, wow! You've got the potential for years to come for fireworks.[54]\\r\\nIn 2009, former head writer Maria Arena Bell developed a storyline about ovarian cancer for Lily.[26] Bell said that the way Lily's struggle was playing out \\"is very much how it would play out in real life\\": \\"There's days where you feel exhausted and you feel powerless...It helps that on our writing team, we have one writer who's currently suffering from breast cancer, who put a lot of her own heart and soul into this story. I myself am a survivor [of] two different cancers.\\"[55] Khalil filmed a public-service announcement for CBS Cares about ovarian cancer and those affected by the disease.[26][56] Lily shaves her head, requiring Khalil to wear hats, scarves, a bald cap and wigs.[57][58][59] The wigs were shorter than the actress' real hair because the writers wanted to make sure the audience knew they were wigs.[59] In 2010 Lily went into remission, and has since been cancer-free.\\r\\nIn 2002, Lily is a rebellious teenager. After living in Paris, her mother Drucilla (Victoria Rowell) moves her back to the United States after she sprayed graffiti in the city. Drucilla hopes that Lilys father, Neil (Kristoff St. John), will reason with her; however, they end up helping him deal with his alcoholism. Lilys parents reunite and plan to remarryto her dismay, since she wanted her mother to be with Wesley Carter (Ben Watkins). Lily comes to terms with their relationship, becoming friends with Colleen Carlton (Lyndsy Fonseca). In 2004 Lily is victimized by Internet predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who rapes her and gives her a sexually-transmitted disease. She forgives him after he saves her from another predator who is trying to rape her, but the situation was staged by Daniel Romalotti (Michael Grazaidei) to make Kevin look like a hero. Lily and Daniel begin dating, to their parents dismay. In 2006 they marry, and soon afterwards Lily discovers her biological father is her uncle Malcolm (Shemar Moore); this strains her relationship with her mother. They reconcile before Drucilla is presumed dead after falling off a cliff during an argument with Daniels mother, Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford). Lily discovers that Daniel has been hiding a pornography addiction which, despite counseling, ends their marriage. Lily is then attracted to Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), but they hesitate to begin a relationship due to their age difference. They eventually begin dating, despite disapproval from Neil.\\r\\nChloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) deceives Cane into believing he fathered her child; however, the childs biological father is Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Cane's relationship with Lily is interrupted, but they become engaged when the truth about the childs paternity is revealed and marry in February 2009. They briefly separate when Canes true identity is revealed, but are reunited when Lily is diagnosed with ovarian cancer (and mourns the death of her best friend, Colleen). During her hysterectomy, two of her eggs are preserved; Cane and Lily want to have children, with Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford) their surrogate mother. She gives birth to twins, Charlie and Mattie Ashby, in June 2010. Soon afterwards Lily goes into remission; an Australian (Blake Joseph) arrives in Genoa City and blackmails Cane, followed by his father Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) in December 2010. Colin is later engaged to Jill Abbott (Jess Walton), and Cane is shot to death by Blake as he tries to stop their wedding. After Canes death Lily sees hallucinations of him in the afterlife, leading her family to suggest therapy. After her hallucination leaves footprints in the snow Lily realizes that Cane is alive, having faked his death; his twin brother, Caleb, was the one who died. Lily feels betrayed and decides to divorce Cane, but later realizes that the story surrounding his faked death was to protect her. They decide to remarry in February 2012 and work at Jabot Cosmetics, where Lily develops an attraction to Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams) which makes Cane jealous. Lily and Tyler share a kiss, but she turns him down and returns to Cane.\\r\\nAfterward, Cane hires an assistant at Chancellor Industries, Hilary Curtis (Mishael Morgan), whom Jill and then Lily become suspicious of. Meanwhile, an unknown blogger is targeting the Winters family online, with photos of Hilary kissing Cane as well as the two of them in a hotel room. After a private investigation, the Winters figure out Hilary is the blogger (as she blames Neil for her mother's death years prior) just as Hilary attempts to drug Cane. She is fired from Chancellor Industries and shunned by the family. After recovering their marriage, Cane and Lily agree to become the new managers of the Genoa City Athletic Club after her brother Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) buys it.\\r\\nKhalil as Winters has grown in popularity among viewers, who voted her onto \\"Top Actress\\" lists in publications such as Soap Opera Digest, Soaps In Depth and Soap Opera Update.[23][61][62][63][64][65] Critics have also praised Khalil for her portrayal; Soap Opera Digest named her performer of the week during Lily's internet-predator storyline, citing the subtlety of her performance.[66] Mark McGarry of Soap Opera Weekly named the actress outstanding performer of the week on February 28, 2005,[67] praising Khalil's \\"remarkable range\\".[67] CBS Soaps In Depth said Sherwood \\"got off to a slow start\\", but praised her work during the revelation that Lily's husband Daniel was responsible for her attempted rape by Alex.[5] Khalil's return in 2006 was greeted positively by viewers.[2][4]\\r\\nLily's cancer storyline was praised by critics and viewers.[68][69][70][71] Janet Di Lauro of Soap Opera Weekly praised the storyline for highlighting Neil and Lily's relationship, saying that they \\"are one of the most effective and heartfelt father-daughter combos in daytime. Kristoff St. John and Christel Khalil share a chemistry that lets the viewers feel Neil's pain when Lily is hurting, and relate to his anger when she has been wronged.\\"[72] Di Lauro criticized the writers for placing a young character such as Lily into so many traumatic stories, including the cancer and hysterectomy.[72] Soap Opera Digest made the cancer story its editor's choice;[73] Di Lauro praised Khalil for her performance during the death of Lily's best friend Colleen Carlton (Tammin Sursok),[74] calling Lily and Colleen's final scenes \\"a bona-fide tearjerker\\" and \\"one of the most touching scenes to air\\" during Colleen's death:[75] \\"Lily could have easily fallen apart and chastised Colleen for leaving her during her house of need. Instead, she held her head high and gave Colleen a proper sendoff... It was as if Lily was gathering strength from Colleen, even as Colleen let go.\\"[75]\\r\\nLily's relationships with Daniel and Cane were listed among Soaps In Depth's 100 Greatest Soap Opera Couples.[76][77] The Daniel-and-Lily storyline attracted viewer support for both Khalil and Sherwood,[7][8][29] and the magazine called the scene when Daniel and Lily make love after his acquittal for the death of Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes) one of the top three moments of 2005.[29] Roscoe Born, who played Tom Fisher, praised their storyline: \\"It really brought the two families into so much conflict, and I thought they were very believable as young lovers. They were very passionate, and at the same time, really evoked that feeling of first love.\\"[29] When Lily and Daniel's marriage ended, fans of the couple were saddened.[20]\\r\\nLily's romance with Cane first received a mixed response; viewers were divided on the couple because of the age difference between the characters.[20][78] Khalil said that she was sure there were going to be people \\"who will always feel\\" that Cane is too old for Lily, but there are others \\"who just don't care about the age difference\\": \\"You can't please everyone. You just have to do your best with the storyline and hope that people will like it.\\"[20] Soap Opera Digest gave the couple a thumbs-up: \\"On paper, a Cane-and-Lily pairing shouldn't work. They've both just left marriages (to Amber and Daniel, though Cane's wasn't legal), their exes are living together, and Cane is older than Lily. Yet, the adorable Aussie and the cute coed make a charming match.\\"[79] The magazine praised the couple because they united the core families, the Winters and the Chancellors.[79] Soap Opera Weekly considered their Valentine's Day surprise in 2008 \\"a hit\\".[80]\\r\\nMichael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps called Cane and Lily as \\"one of daytime's most popular couples\\", and their story with Billy and Chloe \\"one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs\\".[34] Mallory Harlen of Soap Opera Digest praised the quadrangle for adding another layer to Lily: \\"The always prim, always perfect Lily reminded me way too much of Christine Blair...in a bad way. But being a woman scorned really worked for her; her new found feistiness is completely fitting for Drucilla's daughter.\\"[81] Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada criticized the couple; he thought they had no chemistry and wanted Cane \\"in the big leagues and not with little girls\\", but conceded that they had \\"a very vocal, and loyal fanbase\\".[82] Soap Opera Update named Cane and Lily the best couple on The Young and the Restless in 2008,[61] and viewers voted them into top-couple polls in soap-opera magazines.[23][61][62][63][64][65]\\r\\nKhalil received two nominations for Outstanding Younger Actress at the 2004 and 2006 Daytime Emmy Awards,[1][2][5] and two Young Artist Award nominations for Leading Young Actress in 2003 and 2004.[83][84][85] Khalil and Sherwood received NAACP Award nominations for Lead Actress in a Daytime Drama Series in 2007.[86] The following year Khalil won the award, receiving another nomination in 2009.[34][83] She earned a third Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Younger Actress in 2010, for the episode when Lily learns she has cancer.[87][88] In 2012 Khalil received another NAACP Award nomination,[89] winning her first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in the role after four nominations.[90]","input":"When were cain and lily's twins born?"},{"output":"at CBS Studio Center on Radford Avenue in Studio City in the San Fernando Valley","context":"The Wild Wild West is an American weird western television series that ran on the CBS television network for four seasons (104 episodes) from September 17, 1965, to April 4, 1969. Two television movies were made with the original cast in 1979 and 1980, and the series was adapted for a motion picture in 1999.\\r\\nDeveloped at a time when the television western was losing ground to the spy genre, this show was conceived by its creator, Michael Garrison, as \\"James Bond on horseback.\\"[1] Set during the administration of President Ulysses Grant (1869ÿ77), the series followed Secret Service agents James West (Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) as they solved crimes, protected the President, and foiled the plans of megalomaniacal villains to take over all or part of the United States.\\r\\nThe show featured a number of fantasy elements, such as the technologically advanced devices used by the agents and their adversaries. The combination of the Victorian era time-frame and the use of Verne-esque technology has inspired some to give the show credit as being one of the more \\"visible\\" origins of the steampunk subculture. These elements were accentuated even more in the 1999 movie adaptation.\\r\\nDespite high ratings, the series was cancelled near the end of its fourth season as a concession to Congress over television violence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wild Wild West told the story of two Secret Service agents: the fearless and handsome James T. West (played by Robert Conrad), and Artemus Gordon (played by Ross Martin), a brilliant gadgeteer and master of disguise. Their unending mission was to protect President Ulysses S. Grant and the United States from all manner of dangerous threats. The agents traveled in luxury aboard their own train, the Wanderer, equipped with everything from a stable car to a laboratory. James West had served as an intelligence and cavalry officer in the US Civil War on the staff of Ulysses Grant;[2] his \\"cover,\\" at least in the pilot episode, is that of \\"a dandy, a high-roller from the East.\\" Thereafter, however, there is no pretense, and his reputation as the foremost Secret Service agent often precedes him. According to the TV movies, West retires from the Service by 1880 and lives on a ranch in Mexico. Gordon, who was a captain in the Civil War, had also been in show business. When he retires in 1880 he returns to performing as the head of a Shakespeare traveling players troupe.\\r\\nThe show incorporated classic Western elements with an espionage thriller, science fiction/alternate history ideas (in a similar vein to what would later be called steampunk), in one case horror (\\"The Night of the Man Eating House\\") and plenty of humor. In the tradition of James Bond, there were always beautiful women, clever gadgets, and delusional arch-enemies with half-insane plots to take over the country or the world.\\r\\nThe title of each episode begins with \\"The Night\\" (except for the first-season episode \\"Night of the Casual Killer\\", which omitted the definite article \\"The\\"). This followed other idiosyncratic naming conventions established by shows like Rawhide, where each episode title began with \\"Incident at\\" or \\"Incident of,\\" and The Man from U.N.C.L.E., where episodes were titled \\"The (Blank) Affair.\\"\\r\\nRobert Conrad starred as James West. Before The Wild Wild West, Conrad played private eye Tom Lopaka in ABC's Hawaiian Eye for four seasons, 1959-63. Conrad claimed to be the 17th actor to test for the role of James West. (Rory Calhoun was initially announced for the part.) Conrad performed nearly all of his own stunts on The Wild Wild West. \\"For the first few episodes we tried stuntmen,\\" Conrad explained, \\"but the setup time slowed production down, so I volunteered. Things started moving quicker when I took the jumps and the spills. We started meeting the budget.\\"[3] Early on he was doubled by Louie Elias or Chuck O'Brien.\\r\\nOn January 24, 1968, however, during filming of \\"The Night of the Fugitives\\", Conrad fell 12?ft (3.7?m) from a chandelier onto a concrete floor and suffered a concussion.[4] As a result, production of the series (then near the end of its third season) ended two weeks early. Conrad spent weeks in the hospital, and had a long convalescence slowed by constant dizziness. The episode was eventually completed and aired during the fourth season, with footage of the fall left in. Conrad later told Percy Shain of the Boston Globe, \\"I have the whole scene on film. It's a constant reminder to be careful. It also bolstered my determination to make this my last year with the series. Four seasons are enough of this sort of thing.\\"[5]\\r\\nArtemus Gordon was played by Ross Martin. Prior to The Wild Wild West, Martin co-starred in the CBS series Mr. Lucky from 1959 to 1960, portraying Mr. Lucky's sidekick, Andamo. The series was created by Blake Edwards, who also cast Martin in his films Experiment in Terror (1962) and The Great Race (1964).\\r\\nMartin once called his role as Artemus Gordon \\"a show-off's showcase\\" because it allowed him to portray over 100 different characters during the course of the series, and perform dozens of different dialects. Martin sketched his ideas for his characterizations and worked with the makeup artists to execute the final look. Martin told Percy Shain of the Boston Globe, \\"In the three years of the show, I have run a wider gamut than even those acknowledged masters of disguise, Paul Muni and Lon Chaney. Sometimes I feel like a one man repertory company. I think I've proven to myself and to the industry that I am the No. 1 character lead in films today.\\" The industry acknowledged Martin's work with an Emmy nomination in 1969.\\r\\nMartin broke his leg in a fourth-season episode, \\"The Night of the Avaricious Actuary\\". He dropped a rifle, stepped on it, and his foot rolled over it. Martin told Percy Shain of the Boston Globe, \\"In the scene where I was hurt, my stand-in tried to finish it. When the shell ejected from the rifle, it caught him in the eye and burned it. We still haven't finished that scene. It will have to wait until I can move around again.\\"[5]\\r\\nA few weeks later, after completing \\"The Night of Fire and Brimstone\\", Martin suffered a heart attack on August 17, 1968. (This was exactly two years after Michael Garrison died.) Martin's character was replaced temporarily by other agents played by Charles Aidman (four episodes), Alan Hale, Jr. and William Schallert. Aidman said the producers had promised to rewrite the scripts for his new character, but this simply amounted to scratching out the name \\"Artemus Gordon\\" and penciling in \\"Jeremy Pike\\" (his character's name).[1] Pat Paulsen is frequently thought of as a Martin substitute, but he in fact appeared in one of Aidman's episodes, and his character would have been present even if Martin appeared.\\r\\nThe show's most memorable recurring arch-villain was Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless, a brilliant but petulant and megalomaniacal dwarf portrayed by Michael Dunn. Like Professor Moriarty for Sherlock Holmes, Loveless provided West and Gordon with a worthy adversary, whose plans could be foiled but who resisted all attempts to capture him and bring him to justice. Initially he had two constant companions: the huge Voltaire, played by Richard Kiel; and the beautiful Antoinette, played by Dunn's real-life singing partner, Phoebe Dorin. Voltaire disappeared without explanation after his third episode (although Richard Kiel returned in a different role in \\"The Night of the Simian Terror\\"), and Antoinette after her sixth. According to the TV movie The Wild Wild West Revisited, Loveless eventually dies in 1880 from ulcers, brought on by the frustration of having his plans consistently foiled by West and Gordon. (His son, played by Paul Williams, subsequently seeks revenge on the agents.)\\r\\nThough several actors appeared in multiple villainous roles, only one other character had a second encounter with West and Gordon: Count Manzeppi (played flamboyantly by Victor Buono, who played another, different villain in the pilot), a diabolical genius of \\"black magic\\" and crime, wholike Dr. Lovelesshad an escape plan at the end. (Buono eventually returned in More Wild Wild West as \\"Dr. Henry Messenger\\", a parody of Henry Kissinger, who ends up both handcuffed and turning invisible with the villainous Paradine.)\\r\\nAgnes Moorehead won an Emmy for her role as Emma Valentine in \\"The Night of The Vicious Valentine\\". Some of the other villains were portrayed by Leslie Nielsen, Martin Landau, Burgess Meredith, Boris Karloff, Ida Lupino, Carroll O'Connor, Ricardo Montalban, Robert Duvall, Ed Asner, and Harvey Korman.\\r\\nWhile the show's writers created their fair share of villains, they frequently started with the nefarious, stylized inventions of these madmen (or madwomen) and then wrote the episodes to capitalize on these devices. Henry Sharp, the series' story consultant, would sketch the preliminaries of the designs (eccentrically numbering every sketch \\"fig. 37\\"), and give the sketch to a writer, who would build a story around it.[6] Episodes were also inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells, and Jules Verne.\\r\\nIn 1954, Michael Garrison and Gregory Ratoff purchased the film rights to Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, for $600. CBS bought the TV rights for $1,000, and on October 21, 1954 broadcast an hour-long adaptation on its Climax! series, with Barry Nelson playing American agent Jimmy Bond and Peter Lorre playing the villain, Le Chiffre. CBS also approached Fleming about developing a Bond TV series. (Fleming later contributed ideas to NBC's The Man From U.N.C.L.E.)\\r\\nIn 1955 Ratoff and Garrison bought the rights to the novel in perpetuity for an additional $6,000. They pitched the idea for a film to 20th Century Fox, but studio turned them down. After Ratoff died in 1960, his widow and Garrison sold the film rights to Charles K. Feldman for $75,000. Feldman eventually produced the spoof Casino Royale in 1967. By then, Garrison and CBS had brought a James Bond to television in a unique way.\\r\\nThe pilot episode, \\"The Night of the Inferno\\", was produced by Garrison and, according to Robert Conrad, cost $685,000.[7] The episode was scripted by Gilbert Ralston, who had written for numerous episodic TV series in the 1950s and 1960s. In a later deposition, Ralston explained that he was approached by Michael Garrison, who \\"said he had an idea for a series, good commercial idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a western hero and a James Bond type together in the same show.\\"[8] Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the format, the story outline and nine drafts of the pilot script that was the basis for the television series. It was his idea, for example, to have a secret agent named Jim West who would perform secret missions for President Ulysses S. Grant. (Ralston later sued Warner Bros. over the 1999 motion picture Wild Wild West based on the series.)\\r\\nAs indicated by Robert Conrad on his DVD commentary, the show went through several changes in producers in its first season. This was apparently due to conflicts between the network and Garrison, who had no experience producing for television and had trouble staying on budget. At first, Ben Brady was named producer, but he was shifted to Rawhide, which had its own crisis when star Eric Fleming quit at the end of the 1964-65 season. (That series lasted for another thirteen episodes before it was cancelled by CBS.)\\r\\nThe network then hired Collier Young.[9] In an interview, Young said he saw the series as The Rogues set in 1870. (The Rogues, which he had produced, was about con men who swindled swindlers, much like the 1970s series Switch.) Young also claimed to have added the wry second \\"Wild\\" to the series title, which had been simply \\"The Wild West\\" in its early stages of production.[10] Young lasted three episodes (2ÿ4). His shows featured a butler named Tennyson who traveled with West and Gordon, but since the episodes were not broadcast in production order, the character popped up at different times during the first season. Conrad was not sorry to see Young go: \\"I don't mind. All that guy did creatively was put the second 'wild' in the title. CBS did the right thing.\\"[11]\\r\\nYoung's replacement, Fred Freiberger, returned the series to its original concept. It was on his watch that writer John Kneubuhl, inspired by a magazine article on Michael Dunn, created the arch-villain Dr. Miguelito Loveless. Phoebe Dorin, who played Loveless' assistant, Antoinette, recalled: \\"Michael Garrison came to see [our] nightclub act when he was in New York. Garrison said to himself, 'Michael Dunn would make the most extraordinary villain. People have never seen anything like him before, and he's a fabulous little actor and he's funny as hell.' And, Garrison felt, if Michael Dunn sang on every show, with the girl, it would be an extraordinary running villain. He came backstage and he told us who he was and he said he was going to do a television show called The Wild Wild West and we would be called. We thought, 'Yeah, yeah, we've heard all that before.' But he did call us and the show was a fantastic success. And that's how it started, because he saw the nightclub act.\\"[12] Loveless was introduced in the show's sixth produced, but third televised episode, \\"The Night the Wizard Shook The Earth.\\" The character became an immediate hit and Dunn was contracted to appear in four episodes per season. Because of health problems, Dunn could only appear in 10 episodes instead of 16.\\r\\nAfter ten episodes (5ÿ14), Freiberger and executive producer Michael Garrison were, according to Variety, \\"unceremoniously dumped,\\" reputedly due to a behind-the-scenes power struggle. Garrison was replaced by Phillip Leacock, the executive producer of Gunsmoke, and Frieberger was supplanted by John Mantley, an associate producer on Gunsmoke. The exchange stunned both cast and crew. Garrison, who owned 40% of The Wild Wild West, knew nothing about the changes and hadn't been consulted. He turned the matter over to his attorneys. Freiberger said, \\"I was fired for accomplishing what I had been hired to do. I was hired to pull the show together when it was in chaos.\\"[13] Conrad said, \\"I was totally shocked by it. Let's face it, the show is healthy. I think Fred Freiberger is totally correct in his concept of the show. It's an administrative change, for what reason I don't know.\\"[13]\\r\\nMantley produced seven (15ÿ21) episodes then returned to his former position on Gunsmoke, and Gene L. Coon took over as associate producer. By then, Garrison's conflict with CBS was resolved and he returned to the executive producer role. Coon, however, left after six episodes (22ÿ27) to write First to Fight (1967), a Warner Bros. film about the Marines. Garrison produced the last episode of season one and the initial episodes of season two.[14]\\r\\nGarrison's return was much to the relief of Ross Martin, who once revealed that he was so disenchanted during the first season that he tried to quit three times. He explained that Garrison \\"saw the show as a Bond spoof laid in 1870, and we all knew where we stood. Each new producer tried to put his stamp on the show and I had a terrible struggle. I fought them line by line in every script. They knew they couldn't change the James West role very much, but it was open season on Artemus Gordon because they had never seen anything like him before.\\"[15]\\r\\nOn August 17, 1966, however, during production of the new season's ninth episode, \\"The Night of the Ready-Made Corpse\\", Garrison fell down a flight of stairs in his home, fractured his skull, and died. CBS brought in Bruce Lansbury, brother of actress Angela Lansbury, to produce the show for the remainder of its run. In the early 1960s Lansbury had been in charge of daytime shows at CBS Television City in Hollywood, then vice president of programming in New York. When he was tapped for The Wild Wild West, Lansbury was working with his twin brother, Edgar, producing legitimate theater on Broadway.\\r\\nThe first season's episodes were filmed in black and white, and they were darker in tone. Cinematographer Ted Voightlander was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on one of these episodes, \\"The Night of the Howling Light.\\" Subsequent seasons were filmed in color, and the show became noticeably campier.\\r\\nThe Wild Wild West was filmed at CBS Studio Center on Radford Avenue in Studio City in the San Fernando Valley. The 70-acre lot was formerly the home of Republic Studios, which specialized in low-budget films including Westerns starring Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and Saturday morning serials (which The Wild Wild West appropriately echoed). CBS had a wall-to-wall lease on the lot starting in May 1963, and produced Gunsmoke and Rawhide there, as well as Gilligan's Island. The network bought the lot from Republic in February 1967, for $9.5 million. Beginning in 1971, MTM Enterprises (headed by actress Mary Tyler Moore and her then-husband, Grant Tinker) became the Studio Center's primary tenant. In the mid-1980s the western streets and sets were replaced with new sound stages and urban facades, including the New York streets seen in Seinfeld. In 1995 the lagoon set that was originally constructed for Gilligan's Island was paved over to create a parking lot.[16]\\r\\nAmong iconic locations used for filming were Bronson Canyon (\\"Night of the Returning Dead\\" S02E05) and Vasquez Rocks (\\"Night of the Cadre\\" S02E26).\\r\\nFor the pilot episode, \\"The Night of the Inferno\\", the producers used Sierra Railroad No. 3, a 4-6-0 locomotive that was, fittingly, an anachronism: Sierra No. 3 was built in 1891, fifteen to twenty years after the series was set. Footage of this train, with a 5 replacing the 3 on its number plate, was shot in Jamestown, California. Best known for its role as the Hooterville Cannonball in the CBS series Petticoat Junction, Sierra No. 3 probably appeared in more films and TV shows than any other locomotive in history. It was built by the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works in Paterson, New Jersey.\\r\\nWhen The Wild Wild West went into series production, however, an entirely different train was employed. The locomotive, a 4-4-0 named the Inyo, was built in 1875 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia.[17] Originally a wood-burner, the Inyo was converted to oil in 1910. The Inyo, as well as the express car and the passenger car, originally served the Virginia and Truckee Railroad in Nevada. They were among V&T cars sold to Paramount Pictures in 1937ÿ38. The Inyo appears in numerous films including High, Wide, and Handsome (1938), Union Pacific (1939), The Marx Brothers' Go West (1940), Meet Me in St. Louis, (1944), Red River (1948), Disney's The Great Locomotive Chase (1956) and McLintock! (1963). For The Wild Wild West, Inyo's original number plate was temporarily changed from No. 22 to No. 8 so the train footage could be flopped horizontally without the number appearing reversed. Footage of the Inyo in motion and idling was shot around Menifee, California, and reused in virtually every episode. (Stock footage of Sierra No. 3 occasionally resurfaced as well.)\\r\\nThese trains were used only for exterior shots. The luxurious interior of the passenger car was constructed on Stage 6 at CBS Studio Center. (Neither Stage 6 or the western streets still exist.) Designed by art director Albert Heschong,[18] the set reportedly cost $35,000 in 1965 (approximately $250,000 in 2011 dollars).[19] The interior was redesigned when the show switched to color for the 1966-67 season.\\r\\nThe train interior was also used in at least one episode of Gunsmoke (\\"Death Train,\\" aired January 27, 1967), and in at least two episodes of The Big Valley (\\"Last Train to the Fair,\\" aired April 27, 1966, and \\"Days of Wrath,\\" aired January 8, 1968). All three series were filmed at CBS Studio Center and shared other exterior and interior sets. Additionally, the interior was used for an episode of Get Smart (\\"The King Lives?\\", aired January 6, 1968) and the short-lived Barbary Coast (\\"Funny Money,\\" aired September 8, 1975).\\r\\nAfter her run on The Wild Wild West, the Inyo participated in the Golden Spike Centennial at Promontory, Utah, in 1969. The following year it appeared as a replica of the Central Pacific's \\"Jupiter\\" locomotive at the Golden Spike National Historical Site. The State of Nevada purchased the Inyo in 1974; it was restored to 1895 vintage, including a wider smoke stack and a new pilot (cow catcher) without a drop coupler. The Inyo is still operational and displayed at the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City. The express car (No. 21) and passenger car (No. 4) are also at the museum.\\r\\nAnother veteran V&T locomotive, the Reno (built in 1872 by Baldwin), was used in the two The Wild Wild West TV movies.[20] The Reno, which resembles the Inyo, is located at Old Tucson Studios.\\r\\nThe 1999 Wild Wild West motion picture used the Baltimore & Ohio 4-4-0 No. 25, one of the oldest operating steam locomotives in the U.S. Built in 1856 at the Mason Machine Works in Taunton, Massachusetts, it was later renamed The William Mason in honor of its manufacturer. For its role as \\"The Wanderer\\" in the motion picture, the engine was sent to the steam shops at the Strasburg Railroad for restoration and repainting. The locomotive is brought out for the B&O Train Museum in Baltimore's \\"Steam Days\\".\\r\\nThe Inyo and The William Mason both appeared in the Disney film The Great Locomotive Chase (1956).\\r\\nThe Wild Wild West featured numerous, often anachronistic, gadgets. Some were recurring devices, such as James' sleeve gun or breakaway derringer hidden in his left and right boot heels. Others appeared in only a single episode.\\r\\nMost of these gadgets are concealed in West's garments:\\r\\nAboard the train:\\r\\n- Clockwork-powered lock-picking device used by Artie\\r\\nOther gadgets:\\r\\nThe villains often used equally creative gadgets, including:\\r\\nThe main title theme was written by Richard Markowitz, who previously composed the theme for the TV series The Rebel. He was brought in after the producers rejected two attempts by film composer Dimitri Tiomkin.\\r\\nIn an interview by Susan Kesler (for her book, The Wild Wild West: The Series) included in the first season DVD boxed set, Markowitz recalled that the original Tiomkin theme \\"was very, kind of, traditional, it just seemed wrong.\\" Markowitz explained his own approach: \\"By combining jazz with Americana, I think that's what nailed it. That took it away from the serious kind of thing that Tiomkin was trying to do... What I did essentially was write two themes: the rhythmic, contemporary theme, Fender bass and brushes, that vamp, for the cartoon effects and for West's getting himself out of trouble, and the heraldic western outdoor theme over that, so that the two worked together.\\"\\r\\nSession musicians who played on the theme were Tommy Morgan (harmonica); Bud Shank, Ronnie Lang, Plas Johnson, and Gene Cipriano (woodwinds); Vince DeRosa and Henry Sigismonti (French Horns); Uan Rasey, Ollie Mitchell, and Tony Terran (trumpets); Dick Nash, Lloyd Ulyate, Chauncey Welsch, Kenny Shroyer (trombones). Tommy Tedesco and Bill Pitman (guitars); Carol Kaye (Fender bass); Joe Porcaro (brushes); Gene Estes, Larry Bunker, and Emil Richards (timpani, percussion).\\r\\nMarkowitz, however, was never credited for his theme in any episode; it is believed[by whom?] that this was due to legal difficulties between CBS and Tiomkin over the rejection of the latter's work. Markowitz did receive \\"music composed and conducted by\\" credits for episodes he'd scored (such as \\"The Night of the Bars of Hell\\" and \\"The Night of the Raven\\") or where he supplied the majority of tracked-in cues (for example in \\"The Night of the Grand Emir\\" and \\"The Night of the Gypsy Peril\\"). He finally received \\"theme by\\" credit on both of the TV movies, which were scored by Jeff Alexander rather than Markowitz (few personnel from the series were involved with the TV movies).\\r\\nThe animated title sequence was another unique element of the series. Created by Michael Garrison Productions and DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, it was directed by Isadore \\"Friz\\" Freleng and animated by Ken Mundie,[24] who designed the titles for the film The Great Race and the TV series Secret Agent, Rawhide, and Death Valley Days.\\r\\nThe screen was divided into four corner panels surrounding a narrow central panel that contained a cartoon \\"hero\\". The Hero, who looked more like a traditional cowboy than either West or Gordon, encounters clich western characters and situations in each of the panels. In the three seasons shot in color, the overall backdrop was an abstracted wash of the flag of the United States, with the upper left panel colored blue and the others containing horizontal red stripes.\\r\\nThe original animation sequence is:\\r\\nThis teaser part of the show was incorporated into The History Channel's Wild West Tech (2003ÿ5).\\r\\nEach episode had four acts. At the end of each act, the scene, usually a cliffhanger moment, would freeze, and a sketch or photograph of the scene faded in to replace the cartoon art in one of the four corner panels. The style of freeze-frame art changed over the course of the series. In all first-season episodes other than the pilot, the panels were live-action stills made to evoke 19th-century engravings. In season two (the first in color) the scenes dissolved to tinted stills; from \\"The Night of the Flying Pie Plate\\" on, however, the panels were home to Warhol-like serigraphs of the freeze-frames. The end credits were displayed over each episode's unique mosaic except in the final season, when a standardized design was used (curiously, in this design the bank robber is unconscious, the cardsharp has no card and the lady is on the ground, but the sixshooter in the upper left-hand panel has returned). The freeze-frame graphics were shot at a facility called Format Animation.[citation needed] The pilot is the only episode in which the center panel of the Hero is replaced by a sketch of the final scene of an act; in the third act he is replaced by the villainous General Cassinello (Nehemiah Persoff).\\r\\nDuring the first season, the series title \\"The Wild Wild West\\" was set in the font Barnum,[25] which resembles the newer font P.T. Barnum. In subsequent seasons, the title appeared in a hand-drawn version of the font Dolphin (which resembles newer fonts called Zebrawood, Circus, and Rodeo Clown). Robert Conrad's name was also set in this font. Ross Martin's name was set in the font Bracelet (which resembles newer fonts named Tuscan Ornate and Romantiques). All episode titles, writer and director credits, guest cast and crew credits were set in Barnum. During commercial breaks, the title \\"The Wild Wild West\\" also appeared in Barnum.\\r\\nThe series is generally set during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, 1869ÿ77; occasional episodes indicate a more precise date:\\r\\nSome episodes were violent for their time, and that, rather than low ratings, ultimately was the series' downfall (citation?). In addition to gunplay, there were usually two fight sequences per episode. These were choreographed by Whitey Hughes and performed by Conrad and a stock company of stuntmen, including Red West, Dick Cangey, and Bob Herron (who doubled for Ross Martin).\\r\\nAfter he suffered a concussion filming \\"The Night of the Fugitives,\\" the network insisted that Conrad defer to a double. (His chair on the set was newly inscribed: \\"Robert Conrad, ex-stuntman, retired by CBS, Jan. 24, 1968.\\") \\"[W]hen I came back for the fourth season I was limited to what I could do for insurance reasons,\\" Conrad explained. \\"So I agreed and gradually I did all the fights but couldn't do anything five feet off the ground and of course that went out the window.\\"[26] He was doubled by Jimmy George. Often, George would start a stunt, such as a high fall or a dive through a window, then land behind boxes or off camera, where Conrad was concealed and waiting to seamlessly complete the action. This same ploy was sometimes used by Ross Martin and Bob Herron.\\r\\nIt was hazardous work. Hughes recalled, \\"We had a lot of crashes. We used to say, 'Roll the cameras and call the ambulances.'\\" Conrad recalled in 1994, \\"The injuries started at the top. Robert Conrad: 6-inch fracture of the skull, high temporal concussion, partial paralysis. Ross Martin: broken leg. A broken skull for Red West. Broken leg for Jimmy George. Broken arm for Jack Skelly. And Michael Dunn: head injury and a spinal sprain. He did his own stunts. And on and on.\\"[27]\\r\\nFollowing the 1968 assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, President Lyndon Johnson created the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. One of the questions it tackled was whether violence on television was a contributing factor to violence in American society. (This also included graphic news coverage of the Vietnam War.) The television networks, anticipating these allegations, moved to curtail violence on their entertainment programs before the start of the 1968-69 season.[28] Television reporter Cynthia Lowrey, in an article published in August 1968, wrote that The Wild Wild West \\"is one of the action series being watched by network censors for scenes of excessive violence, even if the violence is all in fun.\\"[29]\\r\\nHowever, despite a CBS mandate to tone down the mayhem, \\"The Night of the Egyptian Queen\\" (aired November 15, 1968) contains perhaps the series' most ferocious barroom brawl. A later memo attached to the shooting script of \\"The Night of Miguelito's Revenge\\" (aired December 13, 1968) reads: \\"Note to Directors: The producer respectfully asks that no violent acts be shot which are not depicted in the script or discussed beforehand.  Most particularly stay away from gratuitous ad-libs, such as slaps, pointing of firearms or other weapons at characters (especially in close quarters), kicks and the use of furniture and other objects in fight scenes.\\" Strict limits were placed on the number of so-called \\"acts of violence\\" in the last episodes of the season (and thus the series). James West rarely wears a gun, and rather than the usual fisticuffs, fight sequences involved tossing, tackling or body blocking the villains.\\r\\nIn December 1968, executives from ABC, CBS and NBC appeared before the President's Commission. The most caustic of the commissioners, Rep. Hale Boggs (D-La.), decried what he called \\"the Saturday morning theme of children's cartoon shows\\" that permit \\"the good guy to do anything in the name of justice.\\" He also indicted CBS for featuring sadism in its primetime programing (The Wild Wild West was subsequently identified as one example). The Congressman did, however, commend CBS for a 25% decline in violence programming in prime time compared to the other two networks.[30]\\r\\nThree months later, in March 1969, Sen. John O. Pastore (D-R.I.) called the same network presidents before his Senate communications subcommittee for a public scolding on the same subject. At Pastore's insistence, the networks promised tighter industry self-censorship, and the Surgeon General began a $1 million study on the effects of television. Congresss concern was shared by the public: in a nationwide poll, 67.5% of 1,554 Americans agreed with the hypothesis that TV and movie violence prompted violence in real life.[31]\\r\\nAdditionally, the National Association for Better Broadcasting (NABB), in a report eventually issued in November 1969, rated The Wild Wild West \\"as one of the most violent series on television.\\"[32]\\r\\nAfter being excoriated by two committees, the networks scrambled to expunge violence from their programming. The Wild Wild West received its cancellation notice in mid-February, even before Pastores committee convened.[33] Producer Bruce Lansbury always claimed that \\"It was a sacrificial lamb  It went off with a 32 or 33 share which in those days was virtually break-even, but it always won its time period.\\"[34] This is confirmed by an article by Associated Press reporter Joseph Mohbat: \\"Shows like ABC's 'Outcasts' and NBC's 'Outsider', which depended heavily on violence, were scrapped. CBS killed 'The Wild, Wild West' despite high ratings, because of criticism. It was seen by the network as a gesture of good intentions.\\"[35] The networks played it safe thereafter: of the 22 new television shows that debuted in the fall of 1969, not one was a western or detective drama; 14 were comedy or variety series.[36]\\r\\nConrad denounced Pastore for many years, but in other interviews he admitted that it probably was time to cancel the series because he felt that he and the stunt men were pushing their luck. He also felt the role had hurt his craft. \\"In so many roles I was a tough guy and I never advanced much,\\" Conrad explained. \\"Wild Wild West was action adventure. I jumped off roofs and spent all my time with the stuntmen instead of other actors. I thought that's what the role demanded. That role had no dimension other than what it wasa caricature of a performance. It was a comic strip character.\\"[37]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1970, CBS reran several episodes of The Wild Wild West on Mondays at 10 p.m. as a summer replacement for the Carol Burnett Show. These episodes were \\"The Night of the Bleak Island\\" (aired July 6); \\"The Night of the Big Blackmail\\" (July 13); \\"The Night of the Kraken\\" (July 20); \\"The Night of the Diva\\" (July 27); \\"The Night of the Simian Terror\\" (August 3); \\"The Night of the Bubbling Death\\" (August 11); \\"The Night of the Returning Dead\\" (August 17); \\"The Night of the Falcon\\" (August 24); \\"The Night of the Underground Terror\\" (August 31); and \\"The Night of the Sedgewick Curse\\" (September 7). Curiously, none of these featured Dr. Loveless.\\r\\nTV critic Lawrence Laurent wrote, \\"The return of Wild Wild West even for a summer re-run isn't surprising. CBS-TV was never really very eager to cancel this series, since over a four-year run that began in 1965 the Wild Wild West had been a solid winner in the ratings. Cancellation came mainly because CBS officials were concerned about the criticism over televised violence and to a lesser degree because Robert Conrad had grown slightly weary of the role of James West. Ever since last fall's ratings started rolling in, CBS has wished that it had kept Wild Wild West. None of the replacements have done nearly as well and, as a result, all of the Friday programs suffered.\\"[38]\\r\\nThat fall, CBS put the program into syndication, giving it new life on local stations across the country. This further antagonized the anti-violence lobby, since the program was now broadcast weekdays and often after school. One group, The Foundation to Improve Television (FIT), filed a suit on November 12, 1970, to prevent WTOP in Washington, D.C., from airing The Wild Wild West weekday afternoons at 4 pm.[39] The suit was brought in Washington, D.C., specifically to gain government and media attention. The suit said the series \\"contains fictionalized violence and horror harmful to the mental health and well-being of minor children\\", and should not air before 9 pm. WTOP's vice president and general manager, John R. Corporan, was quoted as saying, \\"Since programs directed specifically at children are broadcast in the late afternoon by three other TV stations, it is our purpose to counter-program with programming not directed specifically at children.\\" US District Court Judge John J. Sirica, who later presided over the trial of the Watergate burglars and ordered US President Richard Nixon to turn over White House recordings, dismissed the lawsuit in January 1971, referring FIT to take their complaint to the FCC.[40] FIT appealed, but a year and a half later the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the district court decision dismissing the suit on the grounds that FIT had not exhausted the administrative remedies available to them. By then, WTOP had stopped broadcasting the series altogether.[41] At that time, the show was in reruns on about 57 other local stations across the country, including WOR in New York and WFLD in Chicago.\\r\\nIn October 1973 the Los Angeles-based National Association for Better Broadcasting (NABB) reached a landmark agreement with KTTV, a local station, to purge 42 violent cartoon programs, including Mighty Mouse, Magilla Gorilla, Speed Racer, and Gigantor. Additionally, the NABB cited 81 syndicated live-action shows that may have a detrimental influence on some children who are exposed to such programming without parental guidance or perspective when they are telecast before 8:30 p.m. This list included The Wild Wild West, The Avengers, Batman, Man from UNCLE, Roy Rogers, Wanted Dead or Alive, and The Lone Ranger. In Los Angeles, such shows opened with a cautionary announcement: Parents  we wish to advise that because of violence or other possible harmful elements, certain portions of the following program may not be suitable for young children. The NABB hoped to use the cartoon ban and warning announcement as a model for similar agreements with other local stations.[42]\\r\\nBy then The Wild Wild West was running on 99 local stations.[43] Its ongoing popularity throughout the 1970s prompted two television movies, The Wild Wild West Revisited (1979) and More Wild Wild West (1980) (see below). By the spring of 1985 the original series was still carried on 74 local stations.[44]\\r\\nIn the late 1980s the series was still seen on local stations in Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, among other cities. Significantly, WGN (Chicago), which carried the show at 10 a.m. on Sundays, became available nationally through cable television.\\r\\nIn 1994, The Wild Wild West began running on Saturdays at 10 a.m. on Turner Network Television (TNT), which preferred the color episodes to the black and white shows. The series was dropped from WGN soon after. Hallmark Channel aired the series in 2005 as part of its slate of Saturday afternoon Westerns but dropped it after only a few weeks. In 2011 the series began running weekdays and/or weekends on MeTV, then Sundays on the Heroes and Icons digital channel. In 2016 The Wild Wild West returned to MeTV on Saturday afternoons. On January 1, 2018, MeTV began running the series weekday afternoons again, starting with second season (color) episodes. It also airs in the United Kingdom (as of 2015) on the Horror Channel on Sky channel 319, Virgin channel 149, Freeview channel 70 and Freesat channel 138.\\r\\nConrad and Martin reunited for two television movies, The Wild Wild West Revisited (aired May 9, 1979) and More Wild Wild West (aired October 7ÿ8, 1980). Revisited introduced Paul Williams as Miguelito Loveless Jr., the son of the agents' nemesis. (Michael Dunn, who played Dr. Loveless in the original show, had died in 1973.) Loveless planned to substitute clones for the crowned heads of Europe and the President of the United States. (This plot is similar to the second-season episode \\"The Night of the Brain\\".)\\r\\nMost of the exterior filming took place at Old Tucson Studios where there were still many \\"Old West\\" buildings and a functioning steam train and tracks. Interiors were shot at CBS Studio Center. Ross Martin said, \\"We worked on a lot of the same sets at the studio, including the interiors of the old train. We used the same guns and gimmicks and wardrobes?ÿ  with the waistlines let out a little bit. The script, unlike the old shows, is played strictly for comedy. It calls for us to be ten years older than when we were last seen. There are a lot more laughs than adventure.\\"[45]\\r\\nMore Wild Wild West was initially conceived as a rematch between the agents and Miguelito Jr., but Williams was unavailable for the film; his character was changed to Albert Paradine II and played by Jonathan Wintersthis explains why the story begins with various clones of Paradine being murdered (the first film ends with Loveless having cloned himself and placed the doubles around the world). Paradine planned world conquest using a formula for invisibility (recalling the first-season episode \\"The Night of the Burning Diamond\\").\\r\\nBoth TV films were campier than the TV series, although Conrad and Martin played their roles straight. Both films were directed by veteran comedy Western director Burt Kennedy and written by William Bowers (in the latter case with Tony Kayden, from a story by Bowers); neither Kennedy nor Bowers worked on the original series. The Wild Wild West Revisited takes the agents to a town called Wagon Gap. This was a nod to the Abbott and Costello film, The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap (1947), which was based on a treatment by Bowers and D. D. Beauchamp of a short story by Beauchamp.[46]\\r\\nConrad once revealed that CBS intended to do yearly TV revivals of The Wild Wild West.[47] Variety, in its review of the first TV movie, concurred: \\"A couple of more movies in this vein, sensibly spaced, could work in the future.\\" [48] Ross Martin's death in 1981, however, put an end to the idea.\\r\\nConrad was later quoted in Cinefantastique about these films: \\"We all got along fine with each other when we did these, but I wasn't happy with them only because CBS imposed a lot of restrictions on us. They never came up to the level of what we had done before.\\"\\r\\nThe first season of The Wild Wild West was released on DVD in North America on June 6, 2006 by CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment). Although it was touted as a special 40th anniversary edition, it appeared 41 years after the show's 1965 debut. Robert Conrad recorded audio introductions for all 28 first-season episodes, plus a commentary track for the pilot. The set also featured audio interviews by Susan Kesler (for her book, The Wild Wild West: The Series), and 1970s era footage of Conrad and Martin on a daytime talk show. The second season was released on DVD on March 20, 2007; the third season was released on November 20, 2007; and the fourth and final season was released on March 18, 2008. None of the later season sets contained bonus material. A 27-disc complete series set was released on November 4, 2008.[49] It contains all 104 episodes of the series as well as both reunion telefilms.\\r\\nOn May 12, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment released a repackaged version of the complete series set, at a lower price, but did not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series set.[50] On June 13, 2016, the bonus disc was released as a standalone item.\\r\\nIn France, where the series (known locally as Les Mystres de l'Ouest) was a big hit, all four seasons were released in a DVD boxed set before their US release. The French set, released by TF1 Video, includes many of the extras on the US season one set, and many others. \\"The Night of the Inferno\\" is presented twice?ÿ as a regular episode in English with Conrad's audio commentary, and in a French-dubbed version. All of the episodes are presented in English with French subtitles, and several episode titles differ in translation from the original English titles. For example, \\"The Night of the Gypsy Peril\\", \\"The Night of the Simian Terror\\" and \\"The Night of Jack O'Diamonds\\" respectively translate as \\"The Night of the White Elephant\\", \\"The Night of the Beast\\" and \\"The Night of the Thoroughbred\\". Both TV movies are included as extras, but only in French-dubbed versions. The set also features a 1999 interview with Robert Conrad at the Mirande Country Music Festival in France.\\r\\nThe series spawned several merchandising spin-offs, including a seven-issue comic book series by Gold Key Comics, and a paperback novel, Richard Wormser's The Wild Wild West, published in 1966 by Signet (ISBN?0-451-02836-8), which adapted the episode \\"The Night of the Double-Edged Knife\\".\\r\\nIn 1988, Arnett Press published The Wild Wild West: The Series by Susan E. Kesler (ISBN?0-929360-00-1), a thorough production history and episode guide.\\r\\nIn 1998, Berkeley Books published three novels by author Robert Vaughan?ÿ  The Wild Wild West (ISBN?0-425-16372-5), The Night of the Death Train (ISBN?0-425-16449-7), and The Night of the Assassin (ISBN?0-425-16517-5).\\r\\nIn 1990, Millennium Publications produced a four-part comic book series (\\"The Night of the Iron Tyrants\\") scripted by Mark Ellis with art by Darryl Banks. A sequel to the TV series, it involved Dr. Loveless in a conspiracy to assassinate President Grant and the President of Brazil and put the Knights of the Golden Circle into power. The characters of Voltaire and Antoinette were prominent here, despite their respective early departures from Dr. Loveless' side in the original program. A review from the Mile High Comics site states: \\"This mini-series perfectly captures the fun mixture of western and spy action that marked the ground-breaking 1960s TV series.\\" The storyline of the comics mini-series was optioned for motion picture development.\\r\\nIn the 75th volume of the French comic book series Lucky Luke (L'Homme de Washington), published in 2008, both James West and Artemus Gordon have a minor guest appearance, albeit the names have been changed to \\"James East\\" and \\"Artmius Gin\\".\\r\\nWhen Robert Conrad hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC (January 23, 1982), he appeared in a parody of The Wild Wild West. President Lincoln states his famous quip that, if General U.S. Grant is a drunk, he should send whatever he's drinking to his other less successful generals. Lincoln dispatches West and Gordon (Joe Piscopo) to find out what Grant drinks. They discover that Grant is held captive by Velvet Jones (Eddie Murphy).\\r\\nOn July 11, 2017, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 4-disc set of music from the series, featuring Richard Markowitz's theme, episode scores by Markowitz, Robert Drasnin, Dave Grusin, Richard Shores, Harry Geller, Walter Scharf, Jack Pleis and Fred Steiner, and Dimitri Tiomkin's unused theme music.[51]\\r\\nIn January 1992, Variety reported that Warner Bros. was planning a theatrical version of The Wild Wild West directed by Richard Donner, written by Shane Black, and starring Mel Gibson as James West (Donner directed three episodes of the original series). Finally, in 1999, a theatrical motion picture loosely based on the series was released as Wild Wild West (without the definite article used in the series title). Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, the film made substantial changes to the characters of the series, reimagining James West as a black man (played by Will Smith), and Artemus Gordon (played by Kevin Kline) as egotistical and bitterly competitive with West. Additionally, significant changes were made to Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh in the film). No longer a dwarf, he was portrayed as a double amputee confined to a steam-powered wheelchair (similar to that employed by the villain in \\"The Night of the Brain\\"). Loveless' first name was changed from Miguelito to Arliss, and he was given the motive of a bitter Southerner who sought revenge on the North after the Civil War.\\r\\nRobert Conrad reportedly was offered the role of President Grant, but turned it down. He was outspoken in his criticism of the new film, now little more than a comedic Will Smith showcase with virtually no relationship to the action-adventure series. In a New York Post interview (July 3, 1999), Conrad stated that he disliked the movie and that contractually he was owed a share of money on merchandising that he was not paid. He had a long-standing feud with producer Jon Peters, which may have colored his opinion. He was offended at the racial aspects of the film, as well as the casting of Branagh as a double amputee, rather than a little-person actor, in the role of Loveless.\\r\\nConrad took special delight in accepting the Razzie Awards for the motion picture in 1999. It was awarded Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Original Song.\\r\\nIn 2009, Will Smith apologized publicly to Conrad while doing promotion for Seven Pounds:\\r\\nI made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better. ... No, it's funny because I could never understand why Robert Conrad was so upset with Wild Wild West. And now I get it. It's like, 'That's my baby! I put my blood, sweat and tears into that!' So I'm going to apologize to Mr. Conrad for that because I didn't realize. I was young and immature. So much pain and joy went into [my series] The Fresh Prince that my greatest desire would be that it's left alone.\\r\\nAs with many television series, The Wild Wild West had several merchandise tie-ins during its run. These are listed below.[52]\\r\\nOn October 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly's website reported that Ron Moore and Naren Shankar were developing a remake of The Wild Wild West for television,[53] but the project apparently stalled. In December 2013, Moore told Wired, \\"Wild Wild West and Star Trek were two of my great loves. I watched both in syndication in the 70s. Wild Wild West was really interesting, that combination of genresa Western and secret agent, and they dabbled in the occult and paranormal. I really wanted to do a new version for CBS. I still think its a great property. Someday I hope to go back to it.\\"[54]\\r\\nA new fan-produced webseries, Back to the Wild Wild West, began production in November 2011, but apparently has stalled.[55]","input":"Where was wild wild west tv show filmed?"},{"output":"September 2014","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2014, Ebola virus cases in the United States occurred due to four laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (commonly known as \\"Ebola\\") in the United States.[3] Eleven cases have been reported, including these four cases and seven cases medically evacuated from other countries; the first was reported in September 2014.[4] Nine of the people contracted the disease outside the US and traveled into the country, either as regular airline passengers or as medical evacuees; of those nine, two died. Two people have contracted Ebola in the United States. Both were nurses who treated an Ebola patient; both have recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 30, 2014, the CDC announced that Thomas Eric Duncan, a reportedly 42-year-old (later corrected by CDC reports as a 45-year-old[5]) Liberian national visiting the United States from Liberia, had been diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas, Texas.[6][7]\\r\\nDuncan, who had been visiting family in Dallas, was treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.[8][9] By October 4, Duncan's condition had deteriorated from \\"serious but stable\\" to \\"critical\\".[10] On October 8, Duncan died of Ebola.[11]The other three cases diagnosed in the United States as of  October?2014[update] were:\\r\\n\\r\\nHundreds of people were tested or monitored for potential Ebola virus infection,[15] but the two nurses were the only confirmed cases of locally transmitted Ebola. Public health experts and the Obama administration opposed instituting a travel ban on Ebola endemic areas, stating that it would be ineffective and would paradoxically worsen the situation.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one both contracted and died of Ebola virus disease while in the United States. No new cases have been diagnosed in the United States since Craig Spencer was released from a New York City hospital on November 11, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Eric Duncan was from Monrovia, Liberia, to date the country hit hardest by the Ebola virus epidemic.[17] Duncan worked as a personal driver for the general manager of Safeway Cargo, a FedEx contractor in Liberia.[18] According to manager Henry Brunson, Duncan had abruptly quit his job on September 4, 2014, giving no reason.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 15, 2014, the family of Marthalene Williams, who later died of Ebola virus disease, could not call an ambulance to transfer the pregnant Williams to a hospital. Duncan, their tenant, helped to transfer Williams by taxi to an Ebola treatment ward in Monrovia. Duncan rode in the taxi to the treatment ward with Williams, her father and her brother.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 19, Duncan went to Monrovia Airport, where, according to Liberian officials, Duncan lied about his history of contact with the disease on an airport questionnaire before boarding a Brussels Airlines flight to Brussels. In Brussels, Duncan boarded United Airlines Flight 951  to Washington Dulles Airport.[21] From Dulles, he boarded United Airlines Flight 822 to Dallas/Fort Worth. He arrived in Dallas at 7:01?p.m. CDT[22] on September 20, 2014,[8][9] and stayed with his partner and her five children, who lived in the Fair Oaks apartment complex in the Vickery Meadow neighborhood of Dallas.[23][24] Vickery Meadow, the neighborhood in Dallas where Duncan resided, has a large African immigrant population and is Dallas's densest neighborhood.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuncan began experiencing symptoms on September 24, 2014, and arrived at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital emergency room at 10:37 p.m. on September 25.[26] At 11:36 p.m., a triage nurse asked Duncan about his symptoms, and Duncan reported feeling \\"abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea and headache (new onset).\\"[26] The nurse recorded a fever of 100.1?F (37.8?C), but did not inquire as to his travel history as this was not triage protocol at the time.[26] At 12:05 a.m., Duncan was admitted into a treatment area room where the on-duty physician accessed the electronic health record (EHR). The physician noted nasal congestion, a runny nose, and abdominal tenderness. Duncan was given paracetamol (acetaminophen) at 1:24 a.m.[26] CT scan results came back noting \\"no acute disease\\" for the abdominal and pelvic areas and \\"unremarkable\\" for the head.[26] Lab results returned showing slightly low white blood cells, low platelets, increased creatinine, and elevated levels of the liver enzyme AST.[26][27] His temperature was noted at 103.0?F (39.4?C) at 3:02 a.m. and 101.2?F (38.4?C) at 3:32 a.m. Duncan was diagnosed with sinusitis and abdominal pain and sent home at 3:37 a.m. with a prescription for antibiotics, which are not effective for treating viral diseases.[26][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuncan's condition worsened, and he was transported on September 28 to the same Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital emergency room by ambulance.[29][30] Duncan arrived in the emergency room at 10:07 a.m., experiencing diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.[31] Within fifteen minutes, a doctor noted that Duncan had recently come from Liberia and needed to be tested for Ebola. The doctor described following \\"strict C.D.C. protocol\\" including wearing a mask, gown, and gloves. At 12:58 p.m., the doctor called the CDC directly. By 9:40 p.m., Duncan was experiencing explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting.[31] At 8:28 a.m. the next morning, the doctor noted that Duncan \\"appeared to be deteriorating.\\" By 11:32 a.m., Duncan was suffering from fatigue severe enough to prevent him from using the bedside toilet.[31] Later that day, Duncan was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) after all other patients had been evacuated. The next day, September 30, Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease after a positive test result.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuncan's diagnosis was publicly confirmed during a CDC news conference the same day.[32][33] That evening, Duncan reported feeling better and requested to watch a movie. The following morning, Duncan was breathing rapidly and complaining of \\"pain all over\\".[31] By the afternoon, however, he was able to eat, and the doctor noted that he was feeling better. The next day, October 3, Duncan again reported feeling abdominal pain. That evening, the hospital contacted Chimerix, a biotechnology company developing Brincidofovir to combat the disease. The next day, Duncan's organs were failing, and he was intubated to help him breathe. In the afternoon, the hospital began administering Brincidofovir.[34][35] Nurses Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson continued to care for Duncan around the clock. On October 7, the hospital reported that Duncan's condition was improving.[36] However, Duncan died at 7:51 a.m. on October 8, becoming the first person to die in the United States of Ebola virus disease and the index patient for the later infections of nurses Pham and Vinson.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 5, the CDC announced it had lost track of a homeless man who had been in the same ambulance as Duncan. They announced efforts were underway to find the man and place him in a comfortable and compassionate monitoring environment. Later that day, the CDC announced that the man had been found and was being monitored.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to 100 people may have had contact with those who had direct contact with Duncan after he showed symptoms. Health officials later monitored 50 low- and 10 high-risk contacts, the high-risk contacts being Duncan's close family members and three ambulance workers who took him to the hospital.[40] Everyone who came into contact with Duncan was being monitored daily to watch for symptoms of the virus,[41] until October 20, when health officials removed 43 out of the 48 initial contacts of Thomas Duncan from isolation.[42]  On November 7, 2014, Dallas was officially declared \\"Ebola free\\" after 177 monitored people cleared the 21 day threshold without becoming ill.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 2, Liberian authorities said they could prosecute Duncan if he returned because before flying he had filled out a form in which he had falsely stated he had not come into contact with an Ebola case.[44] Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation she was angry with Duncan for what he had done, especially given how much the United States was doing to help tackle the crisis: \\"One of our compatriots didn't take due care, and so, he's gone there and in a way put some Americans in a state of fear, and put them at some risk, and so I feel very saddened by that and very angry with him.The fact that he knew (he might be a carrier) and he left the country is unpardonable, quite frankly.\\"[45]\\r\\nBefore his death, Duncan brazenly claimed that he did not know at the time of boarding the flight that he had been exposed to Ebola; he said he believed the woman he helped was having a miscarriage, which contradicts corroborated accounts from family members who also helped transport the woman to an Ebola ward.[46][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuncan's family said the care Duncan received was at best \\"incompetent\\" and at worst \\"racially motivated\\".[47] Family members threatened legal action against the hospital where Duncan received treatment.[48] In response, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital issued a statement, \\"Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.\\"[49] The hospital spent an estimated $500,000 on Duncan's treatment. He had no health insurance.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficials at Texas Presbyterian Hospital have said the hospital has become like a \\"ghost town\\" as patients have canceled scheduled surgeries and those seeking emergency care have avoided the emergency room.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reaction to the care and treatment of Thomas Duncan, and the subsequent transmission to two of the nurses on his care team, have caused several hospitals to question the extent to which they are obligated to treat Ebola patients. Discussions on curtailing treatment are underway at Geisinger Health System, which operates hospitals in Pennsylvania, and Intermountain Healthcare, which runs facilities in Utah, according to their spokesmen. Their concern surrounds the reality that understaffed and poorly equipped hospitals performing invasive procedures, like renal dialysis and intubation, both of which Duncan received at Texas Presbyterian, could put staff at too much risk for contracting the virus. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta also used renal dialysis in treating patients at their biocontainment unit, but no health care workers became infected.[52] In October 2014 Vickery Meadow residents stated that people were discriminating against them because of the incident.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of October 10, Nina Pham, a 26-year-old nurse who had treated Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, reported a low-grade fever and was placed in isolation. On October 11, she tested positive for Ebola virus, becoming the first person to contract the virus in the U.S. On October 12, the CDC confirmed the positive test results.[12]  Hospital officials said Pham had worn the recommended protective gear when treating Duncan on his second visit to the hospital and had \\"extensive contact\\" with him on \\"multiple occasions\\". Pham was in stable condition as of October 12.[12][54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 16, Pham was transferred to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.[56] On October 24, the NIH declared Pham free of the Ebola virus.[57] That day Pham traveled to the White House where she met with President Obama.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, initially blamed a breach in protocol for the infection.[59] The hospital's chief clinical officer, Dr. Dan Varga, said all staff had followed CDC recommendations. Bonnie Costello of National Nurses United said, \\"You don't scapegoat and blame when you have a disease outbreak. We have a system failure. That is what we have to correct.\\"[60] Frieden later spoke to \\"clarify\\" that he had not found \\"fault with the hospital or the healthcare worker\\".[61] National Nurses United criticized the hospital for its lack of Ebola protocols and for guidelines that were \\"constantly changing\\".[62] Briana Aguirre, a nurse who had cared for Nina Pham, criticized the hospital in an appearance on NBC's Today Show. Aguirre said that she and others had not received proper training or personal protective equipment, and that the hospital had not provided consistent protocols for handling potential Ebola patients into the second week of the crisis.[63] A report indicated that healthcare workers did not wear hazmat suits until Duncan's test results confirmed his infection due to Ebola, two days after his admission to the hospital.[64] Frieden later said that the CDC could have been more aggressive in the management and control of the virus at the hospital.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 2, 2015 The New York Times reported that Pham filed a suit against Texas Health Resources, her hospital's parent company, accusing it of \\"negligence, fraud and invasion of privacy\\".[66] Pham was described as still suffering from numerous physical and psychological problems, listing lack of proper training as the reason for her illness.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 14, a second nurse at the same hospital, identified as 29-year-old Amber Vinson,[67] reported a fever. Amber Joy Vinson[68] was among the nurses who had provided treatment for Duncan. Vinson was isolated within 90 minutes of reporting the fever. By the next day, Vinson had tested positive for Ebola virus.[69] On October 13, Vinson had flown Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas, after spending the weekend in Tallmadge and Akron, Ohio. Vinson had an elevated temperature of 99.5?F (37.5?C) before boarding the 138-passenger jet, according to public health officials. Vinson had flown to Cleveland from Dallas on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 on October 10.[70] Flight crew members from Flight 1142 were put on paid leave for 21 days.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a press conference, CDC Director Tom Frieden stated she should not have traveled since she was one of the health care workers known to have had exposure to Duncan.[72] Passengers of both flights were asked to contact the CDC as a precautionary measure.[73][74][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was later discovered that the CDC had, in fact, given Vinson permission to board a commercial flight to Cleveland.[76] Before her trip back to Dallas, she spoke to Dallas County Health Department and called the CDC several times to report her 99.5?F (37.5?C) temperature before boarding her flight. A CDC employee who took her call checked a CDC chart, noted that Vinson's temperature was not a true fever ÿ a temperature of 100.4?F (38.0?C) or higher ÿ which the CDC deemed as \\"high risk\\", and let her board the commercial flight.[77][78] On October 19, Vinson's family released a statement detailing her government-approved travel clearances and announcing that they had hired a Washington, DC, attorney, Billy Martin.[79] As a precaution, sixteen people[80] in Ohio who had had contact with Vinson were voluntarily quarantined.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 15, Vinson was transferred to the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.[81] Seven days later, Vinson was declared Ebola free by Emory University Hospital.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  October?15, 2014[update], there were 76 Texas Presbyterian Hospital health care workers being monitored because they had had some level of contact with Thomas Duncan.[83] On October 16, after learning that Vinson had traveled on a plane before her Ebola diagnosis, the Texas Department of State Health Services advised all health care workers exposed to Duncan to avoid travel and public places until 21 days after their last known exposure.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 23, Craig Spencer,[14] a physician who treated Ebola patients in West Africa, tested positive for Ebola at Bellevue Hospital Center after having a 100.3?F (37.9?C) fever. Officials said he was hospitalized with fever, nausea, pain, and fatigue.[85] He had flown to New York City from Guinea within the previous ten days,[86] and contacted the city's Department of Health and Doctors without Borders after showing symptoms.[87][88] Spencer traveled to Guinea to treat Ebola victims on September 16 and returned on October 16. Spencer had been self-monitoring for symptoms of the disease, and began to feel sluggish on October 21, but did not show any symptoms for two days.[89] His case was the first to be diagnosed in New York.[90] The city was trying to find people who may have been in contact with Spencer between October 21ÿ23.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 22, the day before he had symptoms, Spencer rode the New York City Subway, walked on the High Line park, went to a bowling alley and a restaurant in Brooklyn, took an Uber cab to his home in Manhattan, and took a 3-mile (4.8?km) jog in Harlem near where he lived.[91][92] Three other people who were with Spencer in the previous few days were quarantined as well.[93] Spencer's apartment and the bowling alley he went to were cleaned by hazmat company Bio Recovery Corporation.[94][95] Health officials stated it was unlikely that Spencer could have transmitted the disease through subway poles, hand railings, or via bowling balls.[96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York hospitals, health-workers, and officials had conducted weeks of drills and training in preparation for Craig Spencer. Upon arrival at the hospital, he was put in a specially designed isolation center for treatment. Not many details about the treatment were given, except that he participated in decisions relating to his medical care.[98] On October 25, the New York Post reported that an anonymous source had said that nurses at Bellevue had been calling in sick to avoid having to care for Spencer. A hospital spokesperson denied there was a sick out.[99] On November 1, his condition was upgraded to \\"stable\\",[100] and on November 7 the hospital announced he was free of Ebola.[101] Spencer was released from the hospital on November 11.[102] He was cheered and applauded by medical staff members, and hugged by the Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio as he walked out of the hospital. The Mayor also declared: \\"New York City is Ebola free\\".[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of Spencer's Ebola case, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), has proposed an Ebola fund in an omnibus bill to be considered in fiscal year 2015. Schumer said the funds are needed to compensate New York City, as well as other cities treating Ebola patients, in the same way the federal government covers communities that suffer after a natural disaster. Schumer said Craig Spencer's care at Bellevue Hospital involved around 100 health care workers. In addition, the city's health department has established a 24-hour-a-day operation involving 500 staffers to keep track of the approximately 300 persons from West Africa hot spots who arrive in New York every day.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa was over in June 2016, seven Americans had been evacuated to the U.S. for treatment after contracting Ebola virus while working with medical teams trying to stop the epidemic.[104]\\r\\nKent Brantly, a physician and medical director in Liberia for the aid group Samaritan's Purse, and co-worker Nancy Writebol were infected in July 2014, while working in Monrovia.[105][106][107] Both were flown to the United States at the beginning of August via the CDC's Aeromedical Biological Containment System for further treatment in Atlanta's Emory University Hospital.[108] On August 21, Brantly and Writebol recovered and were discharged.[109] Brantly has since donated blood to three others with Ebola (Sacra, Mukpo and Pham).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 4, a Massachusetts physician, Rick Sacra, was airlifted from Liberia to be treated in Omaha, Nebraska at the Nebraska Medical Center. Working for Serving In Mission (SIM), he was the third U.S. missionary to contract Ebola.[110] He thinks he probably contracted Ebola while performing a caesarean section on a patient who had not been diagnosed with the disease. While in hospital, Sacra received a blood transfusion from Brantly, who had recently recovered from the disease. On September 25, Sacra was declared Ebola-free and released from the hospital.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 9, the fourth U.S. citizen who contracted the Ebola virus arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for treatment. On October 16, he released a statement saying he has improved and expects to be discharged in the near future. The doctor was identified as Dr. Ian Crozier, and according to the hospital the sickest patient treated.[112][113][114] He was scheduled to receive a blood or serum transfusion from a British man who had recently recovered from the disease.[115] In addition, on September 21, a CDC employee, who showed no symptoms of the disease, was flown back to the United States as a preventative measure after low-risk exposure with a healthcare worker; he posed no risks to his family or the United States, and he is not known to have died.[116] On September 28, a fourth American doctor was admitted to National Institutes of Health hospital.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 2, NBC News photojournalist Ashoka Mukpo, covering the outbreak in Liberia, tested positive for Ebola after showing symptoms.[118] Four other members of the NBC team, including physician Nancy Snyderman, were being closely monitored for symptoms.[119] Mukpo was evacuated on October 6 to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for treatment in their isolation unit.[104] On October 21, Mukpo was declared Ebola-free and allowed to return to his home in Rhode Island.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nA government official in Sierra Leone announced on November 13, that a doctor from Sierra Leone, a permanent resident of the United States married to a U.S. citizen, would be transported to the Nebraska Medical Center for treatment for Ebola.[121][122] The doctor, identified later as Dr. Martin Salia, became symptomatic while in Sierra Leone. His initial Ebola test came back negative, but his symptoms persisted. He attempted to treat his symptoms, which included vomiting and diarrhea, believing he had malaria. A second test for Ebola came back positive. His family have expressed concern that the delay in diagnosis might impact his recovery.[123] Dr. Salia arrived at Eppley Airfield in Omaha on November 15, and was transported to the Nebraska Medical Center. According to the team that assisted in the transport, he was critically ill and considered to be the sickest patient to be evacuated, but stable enough to fly.[124] On November 17, Dr. Salia died from the disease. Dr. Philip Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit at Nebraska Medical Center, said Salia's disease was already \\"extremely advanced\\" by the time he arrived in Omaha. By then, Salia's kidneys had failed and he was in acute respiratory distress. Salia's treatment included a blood plasma transfusion from an Ebola survivor, as well as the experimental drug ZMapp. Dr. Salia had been working as a general surgeon in Freetown, Sierra Leone when he fell ill. It was not clear when or where he had had contact with Ebola patients.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nA U.S. clinician contracted Ebola while working in Port Loko, Sierra Leone. He collapsed in the hospital and colleagues who assisted him are being monitored for exposure. He was diagnosed with Ebola on March 10, 2015 and medically evacuated to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland on March 13.[126] His condition was downgraded from serious to critical on March 16.[127] The ten exposed colleagues were flown back to the U.S., going into isolation near the Ebola-rated hospitals at Nebraska, Georgia, and Maryland.[128] On March 26, 2015, the NIH upgraded the medically evacuated health worker being treated in Bethesda from critical to serious. A further 16 volunteers are being monitored for possible exposure.[129] On April 9, 2015, the clinician was upgraded to good condition and discharged.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. military released plans to send up to 4,000 troops to West Africa to establish treatment centers starting September 29. The troops are tasked with building modular hospitals known as Expeditionary Medical Support Systems (EMEDS). Plans included building a 25-bed hospital for health care workers and 17 treatment centers with 100 beds each in Liberia.[131] By the end of September 2014 150 military personnel were helping USAID in the capital, Monrovia.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno ordered on October 27 a 21-day quarantine of all soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance. Up to 12 soldiers have been quarantined so far in a U.S. base in Italy.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2007, US hospitals have relied on CDC infection control protocols to contain Ebola virus disease. Until October 20, 2014, the CDC guidelines allowed hospitals wide latitude to select gear based on interaction between healthcare workers and patients and on the mode of transmission of the disease being handled. The guidelines suggested gowns with \\"full coverage of the arms and body front, from neck to the mid-thigh or below, will ensure that clothing and exposed upper body areas are protected\\", and additionally recommend masks and goggles.[134][135]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome infection control experts[who?] said that many American hospitals improperly trained their personnel to handle Ebola cases because they were following federal guidelines that were too lax. US officials abruptly changed their guidelines on October 14. The New York Times stated that this was an effective acknowledgment that there were problems with the procedures for protecting health care workers. Sean Kaufman, who oversaw infection control at Emory University Hospital while it treated Ebola patients, has said the previous CDC guidelines were \\"absolutely irresponsible and dead wrong\\". Kaufman called to warn the agency about its lax guidelines but, according to Kaufman, They kind of blew me off.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Doctors Without Borders representative, whose organization has been treating Ebola patients in Africa, criticized a CDC poster for lax guidelines on containing Ebola, saying, It doesn't say anywhere that its for Ebola. I was surprised that it was only one set of gloves, and the rest bare hands. It seems to be for general cases of infectious disease.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national nursing union National Nurses United criticized the CDC for making the guidelines voluntary. There were complaints at the Texas hospital that healthcare professionals had to use tape to cover their exposed necks.[136] According to Frieden, the CDC is appointing a hospital site manager to oversee Ebola containment efforts and are making \\"intensive efforts\\" to retrain and supervise staff.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 14, the WHO reported that 125 contacts in the United States were being traced and monitored.[137] On October 20, the CDC updated its guidance on Personal Protective Equipment with new detailed instructions that include specifying that no skin should be exposed and adding extensive instructions for donning and doffing the equipment.[138] On October 20 CDC updated its guidance to add clarification that Ebola may spread through wet droplets such as sneezes.[139][140][141]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid-October 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Ron Klain as the \\"Ebola response coordinator\\" of the United States. Klain is a lawyer who previously served as Joe Biden's and Al Gore's chief of staff.[142] Klain has no medical or health care experience.[143] After previous criticism, Obama said, \\"It may make sense for us to have one person ... so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we're crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's going forward\\". Klain will report to White House Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco and National Security Advisor Susan Rice.[144][145][146][147] Klain will not coordinate with hospitals and the United States Public Health Service, as this is the responsibility of Nicole Lurie, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR).[148] President Barack Obama attempted to calm public fears by hugging nurse Nina Pham who had been cured of Ebola.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Obama announced the formation of rapid response teams to travel to hospitals with newly diagnosed patients. A second set of teams will prep hospitals in cities deemed most likely to see an Ebola virus case. Three of those teams are already operating. In announcing the formation of the teams, President Obama explained, \\"We want a rapid response team, a SWAT team essentially, from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible, hopefully within 24 hours, so that they are taking the local hospital step by step through what needs to be done. The CDC has developed two sets of teams, identified by the acronyms CERT (CDC Ebola Response Team) and FAST (Facility Assessment and Support Teams). The CERTs have 10 to 20 people each, who can be sent to a hospital with a suspected and/or laboratory confirmed Ebola virus case. The teams are drawn from 100 CDC workers and others. The FAST teams assist hospitals that have indicated they are willing to take on Ebola cases.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in October 2014, U.S. government officials began questioning airplane passengers and screening them for fever at five U.S. airports:  John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, O'Hare International Airport in Illinois, Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, and HartsfieldÿJackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia.[151]  Combined, these airports receive more than 94% of passengers from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the three countries most affected by Ebola.[151][152]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough no plans have been announced for other airports, screening in the U.S. represents a second layer of protection since passengers are already being screened upon exiting these three countries. However, the risk can never be totally eliminated.[153]  On October 21, the Department of Homeland Security announced that all passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea will be required to fly into one of these five airports.[154] On October 23, the CDC announced that all passengers from these countries would receive 21-day monitoring.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nA physician with the WHO, Aileen Marty, who had spent 31 days in Nigeria, criticized the complete lack of screening for Ebola on her recent return to the United States through Miami International Airport on October 12.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have also been calls by congressional leaders, including U.S. Representative Ed Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and U.S. Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, to suspend issuing visas to travelers from the affected West African countries, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.[156][157]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 7, Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy signed an order authorizing the mandatory quarantine for 21 days of anyone, even if asymptomatic, who had direct contact with Ebola patients.[158][159] Nine people were quarantined on October 22, in accordance with the Connecticut order.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a joint news conference on October 24, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced that they were imposing a mandatory 21-day quarantine on all air travelers returning to New York and New Jersey from West Africa who have had contact with Ebola patients. In explaining the move from the CDC's voluntary quarantine to a state ordered mandatory one, Cuomo cited the case of Dr. Spencer. \\"In a region like this, you go out three times, you ride the subway, you ride the bus, you could affect hundreds of people.\\" Cuomo praised Spencer's work but stated, \\"He's a doctor and even he didn't follow the voluntary quarantine. Let's be honest.\\"[161][162]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernors Cuomo and Christie stated that their two states needed to go beyond the federal CDC guidelines. Cuomo said Dr. Spencer's activity in the days before his diagnosis showed the guidelines, which includes urging health care workers and others who have had contact with Ebola patients to voluntarily quarantine themselves, were not enough.[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate on October 26, Governor Cuomo modified the state's quarantine procedure, stating that people entering New York who have had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will be quarantined in their homes for the 21 days, with twice daily checks to ensure their health has not changed and that they are complying with the order, and would receive some compensation for lost wages, if any.[163] President Obama and his staff had been attempting to persuade New York Governor Cuomo, New Jersey Governor Christie, and the government of Illinois[164] to reverse their mandatory quarantines.[163]\\r\\n\\r\\nIllinois Governor Pat Quinn issued a similar quarantine authorization the same day as New York and New Jersey initially did, with Florida Governor Rick Scott on October 25, authorizing mandatory twice daily monitoring for 21 days of people identified as coming from countries affected by Ebola.[165][166] Illinois health officials later said that only people at high risk of Ebola exposure, such as not wearing protective gear near Ebola patients, will be quarantined.[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nPennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia have all authorized mandatory twice daily health monitoring and/or temperature reporting for 21 days for people exposed to people with Ebola. Virginia has also implemented mandatory twice daily temperature reporting and daily monitoring from health authorities, but has also authorized mandatory quarantine for higher risk patients.[168][169] California mandated a 21-day quarantine for all health workers who have had contact with Ebola patients.[170]\\r\\n\\r\\nKaci Hickox, an American nurse who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone became the first person placed under the new mandatory quarantine rules on her arrival at Newark Liberty International Airport, in New Jersey. A low-accuracy (forehead) thermometer indicated Hickox developed a fever on Friday night and was taken to University Hospital in Newark. She later tested negative for the Ebola virus but remained quarantined in a medical tent. Hickox and Doctors Without Borders criticized the condition of the quarantine in a tent with a bed and a portable toilet, but without shower facility.[171] Hickox expressed that it was inhumane.[172] The hospital responded that they tried their best to accommodate Hickox by allowing her to have computer access, cell phone, reading materials, and providing take-out food and drink.[173] On October 27, after being symptom free for an additional 24-hour period, testing negative for Ebola, and after the state's quarantine policy was relaxed the night before,[163] Hickox was released from quarantine in New Jersey.[174] She has filed suit.[175]\\r\\n\\r\\nHickox was escorted out of New Jersey and into Maine the following day by a private convoy of SUVs.[176] Maine Governor Paul LePage announced he was joining with his state's health department in seeking legal authority to enforce the quarantine after Hickox announced she would not comply with the isolation protocols in Maine. She left her house on October 29 and October 30.[177] The governor said: \\"She's violated every promise she's made so far, so I can't trust her. I don't trust her.\\"[178] A Maine judge ruled against a mandatory quarantine on October 31, but required Hickox to comply with \\"direct active monitoring,\\" to coordinate her travel with Maine health officials, and to notify health officials if she develops symptoms of Ebola.[179]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 29, Texas Governor Rick Perry announced that a Texas nurse returning from Sierra Leone where she treated Ebola patients, had agreed to self-quarantine at her Austin home for 21 days and undergo frequent monitoring from state health officials. The nurse was not named to protect her privacy. Governor Perry said she agreed to the self-quarantine despite not having any symptoms of Ebola virus. Texas health officials met the nurse after she landed at AustinÿBergstrom International Airport. Perry spoke with the nurse over the phone to thank her for working to fight Ebola. \\"In Texas, we have a great tradition of welcoming our heroes back home, and this heroic individual deserves our appreciation, our compassion and our utmost respect,\\" he said in a statement. \\"The tremendous work that she and so many other health care workers are doing in West Africa is making life better for those in afflicted countries and helps protect the rest of the world from the spread of this terrible disease; they are doing vitally important work that makes us all proud.\\"[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno also ordered on October 27 a 21-day quarantine of all soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance in Liberia. Up to 12 soldiers have been quarantined so far in a U.S. base in Italy.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 13, President Obama issued a memorandum that protects contractors hired by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) from liability should they import Ebola virus into the United States. \\"This authority may be exercised solely for the purpose of holding harmless and indemnifying contractors with respect to claims, losses, or damage arising out of or resulting from exposure, in the course of performance of the contracts, to Ebola,\\" the memorandum stated.[182][183]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were numerous overreactions to the perceived threat of an ebola outbreak, particularly on the part of school officials. On October 16, a building housing two schools in the Solon City School District near Cleveland, Ohio, was closed for a single day of disinfection procedures after finding that a staff member may have been on the aircraft that Amber Vinson used on a previous flight.[184] Another school in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District was disinfected overnight due to similar concerns but remained open. In both cases, affected staff were sent home until cleared by health officials. School officials said that they had been assured by city health officials that there was no risk and that  the disinfection was \\"strictly precautionary\\".[185] Three schools in the Belton Independent School District in Belton, Texas, were also closed. Infectious disease experts considered these closures to be an overreaction and were concerned that it would frighten the public into believing that Ebola is a greater danger than it actually is.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hazlehurst, Mississippi, in response to numerous parents keeping their children from attending school, a principal at Hazlehurst Middle School, agreed to take personal vacation time after he had traveled to Zambia, a country with no current Ebola cases and 3,000 miles away from West Africa.[187][188]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States has the capacity to isolate and manage 11 patients in four specialized biocontainment units. These include the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center in Missoula, Montana and Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.[118][191][192][193]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is as yet no FDA-approved medication or vaccine. The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has stated that the scientific community is still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented.[194] There is no cure or specific treatment that is currently approved.[195] However, survival is improved by early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment. Treatment is primarily supportive in nature.[196] A number of experimental treatments are being considered for use in the context of this outbreak, and are currently or will soon undergo clinical trials.[197][198]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late August 2014, both Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol became the first people to be given the experimental drug ZMapp. They both recovered, but there was no confirmation or proof that the drug was a factor.[199] A Spanish priest with Ebola had taken ZMapp but died afterward.[200] Up until that time, ZMapp had only been tested on primates and looked promising, causing no serious side effects and protecting the animals from infection.[201] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $150,000 to help Amgen increase its production, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has asked a number of centers to also increase production.[202]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been at least two promising treatments for those already infected. The first is Brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral drug, which was given to Duncan, Mukpo, and Spencer.[203]\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment using a transfusion of plasma from Ebola survivors, a form of passive immunotherapy,[204] since it contains antibodies able to fight the virus, has been used with apparent success on a number of patients.[201] Survivor Kent Brantly donated his blood to Rick Sacra, Ashoka Mukpo and nurse Nina Pham.[205][206] The World Health Organization (WHO) has made it a priority to try the treatment, and has been telling affected countries how to do it.[207]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade before 2014, but none has yet been approved for clinical use in humans.[208] Several promising vaccine candidates have been shown to protect nonhuman primates (usually macaques) against lethal infection, and some are now going through the clinical trial process.[209][210]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late October 2014, Canada planned to ship 800 vials of an experimental vaccine to the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, the drug having been licensed by NewLink Genetics Corporation, of Iowa. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline also announced it had expedited research and development of a vaccine, which, if successful, could be available in 2015.[211] Although it's still unknown which ones will be approved, WHO hopes to have millions of vaccine doses ready sometime in 2015, and expects that five more experimental vaccines will start being tested in March 2015.[212]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2014, Navarro College, a two-year public school located in Texas, received media attention for admission rejection letters sent to two prospective students from Nigeria. The letters informed the applicants that the college was \\"not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases.\\"[213] On October 16, Navarro's Vice-President Dewayne Gragg issued a statement confirming that there had indeed been a decision to \\"postpone our recruitment in those nations that the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. State Department have identified as at risk.\\"[214] Nigeria's outbreak was among the least severe in West Africa and was considered over by the WHO on 20 October; the Nigerian health ministry had previously announced on 22 September that there were no confirmed cases of Ebola within the country.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2014, the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University withdrew an invitation it had extended to Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist Michel du Cille because he'd returned three weeks earlier from covering the Ebola outbreak in Liberia.[215][216] In October 2014, Case Western Reserve University withdrew their speaking invitation to Dr. Richard E. Besser, chief health editor at ABC News and former director of the Centers for Disease Control. Besser had recently returned from a trip to Liberia.[216][217][218]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 17, Harvard University imposed limits on travel to Ebola-affected countries (Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia) for its students, staff, and faculty.  All travel to these countries is \\"strongly discourage[d]\\", and such travel as part of a Harvard program requires approval from the provost.[219]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 25, CDC allowed state and local officials to set tighter control policies and Barbara Reynolds, a CDC spokeswoman released a statement saying \\"we will consider any measures that we believe have the potential to make the American people safer\\".[220] On November 1, Ohio tightened restrictions on people travelling to Western African countries impacted by Ebola.[221]Time Magazine's 2014 Person of the Year issue honored health professionals dedicated to fighting Ebola, including Kent Brantly.[222]","input":"When did ebola first come to the us?"},{"output":"Sonia Maria Sotomayor","context":"","input":"Who is the first hispanic supreme court justice?"},{"output":"Internet newspaper","context":"HuffPost (formerly The Huffington Post and sometimes abbreviated HuffPo)[2] is a politically liberal[3]?American news and opinion website and blog that now has both localized and international editions.

A U.S. visa only serves as a preliminary permission given to the alien to travel to the United States and to seek admission to the United States at a designated port of entry. The final admission to the United States in a particular status and for a particular period of time is made at the port of entry by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. For aliens entering the U.S. in a nonimmigrant visa status these details are recorded by the CBP officer on the alien's Form I-94 (Form I-94W for citizens of the Visa Waiver Program countries entering the U.S. for short visits), which serves as the official document authorizing the alien's stay in the United States in a particular non-immigrant visa status and for a particular period of time.[6] 50,000 additional visas are available each year under the visa lottery program.

Even though travelers might not require a passport to enter a certain country, they will require a valid passport booklet (booklet only, U.S. Passport Card not accepted) when attempting to depart the U.S. in order to satisfy the U.S. immigration authorities.[8] Exemptions to this requirement to hold a valid passport booklet include:\\r\\nFour Countries and Bermuda have visa exemption access to the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including three that are linked with Compacts of Free Association.[9] Citizens of these jurisdictions are generally not required to apply for visas or pre-approval registrations prior to arrival.\\r\\nCitizens of the following countries, linked with the U.S. by the Compacts of Free Association, do not require a visa to enter, reside, study, and work indefinitely in the United States:\\r\\nCurrently, 38 countries have been selected by the US government for inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program and their citizens do not need to acquire a US visa (but are required to get an electronic authorization if arriving by air or cruise ship[18]) to visit the United States, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands:[19]\\r\\nCancelled:\\r\\nVisitors may stay for 90 days in the United States which also includes the time spent in Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, or the islands in the Caribbean if the arrival was through the United States.\\r\\nThe Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) is not a visa. Rather, obtaining a travel authorization from ESTA is a prerequisite to travelling by air or sea to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program.[23] ESTA authorization, once obtained, is valid for two years unless during that time the person obtains a new passport or his/her answers to any of the eligibility questions change.[24] VWP does not apply if a passenger is not arriving on an approved air or sea carrier.\\r\\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security extended the scope of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act. As of January 2016[update], visa waivers do not apply where a person has previously traveled to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen on or after 1 March 2011 or for those who remain nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria in addition to the nationality that would otherwise entitle them to a visa waiver. Instead, they are now required to go through the process to obtain a visa.[25] Certain categories such as diplomats, military, journalists, humanitarian workers or legitimate businessmen may have their visa requirement waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security.[26]\\r\\nCitizens of the following country can travel without obtaining a visa for the United States only under certain conditions:\\r\\nBritish Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs) by virtue of their connection to one of the following territories may elect to travel with their British citizen passports with valid ESTA, or can alternatively use their BOTC passports to enter the U.S. in certain circumstances.\\r\\nAlthough the visa policy of the U.S. also applies to the U.S. territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in general, both territories have additional visa waiver programs for certain nationalities.[34][35] The GuamÿCNMI Visa Waiver Program, first enacted in October 1988 and periodically amended, permits nationals from twelve countries in Asia, Europe and Oceania to enter the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam as tourists for up to 45 days without the need of obtaining a U.S. visa or an ESTA. A parole agreement enacted in 2009 provides two more countries visa-free access to the territories for 45 days:[36][37][38][39][40]\\r\\n1 - under a separate parole agreement.\\r\\n2 - for the Northern Mariana Islands only.\\r\\n3 - Must present a valid Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card on arrival.\\r\\n4 - for holders of Taiwanese passports with a National ID number. Must present a valid Taiwanese national identity card on arrival. Must travel on a nonstop flight from Taiwan.\\r\\n5 - for holders of British Citizen and British National (Overseas) passports only. British Nationals (Overseas) must present a valid Hong Kong permanent identity card on arrival in order to be eligible for the waiver.\\r\\nTravelers with B-1/B-2 visa or ESTA are admitted to the territories in accordance with the terms of ESTA or visa.\\r\\nTravelers utilizing the program or the parole are required to complete an I-736 form, hold a machine-readable passport and nonrefundable return ticket, and are not permitted to travel onwards to the contiguous United States. Because of special visa categories for the Northern Mariana Islands foreign workers, traveling between Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands still requires a full immigration inspection, and all visitors departing Guam or Northern Mariana Islands are inspected regardless of final destination.[41]\\r\\nU.S. visa policy does not apply to the territory of American Samoa, as it has its own entry requirements and maintains control of its own borders. Hence, neither a U.S. visa nor an ESTA can be used to enter American Samoa. U.S. nationals may enter and remain indefinitely; nationals of countries in the American Samoa Entry Permit Waiver Program may enter with an \\"OK to board\\", issued electronically, for visits not exceeding 30 days; nationals of other countries require an entry permit. The \\"OK to board\\" or entry permit cannot be obtained from a U.S. diplomatic mission, but from the Attorney General's Office of American Samoa.[42][43]\\r\\nGovernment sources disagree on the exact list of countries in the American Samoa Entry Permit Waiver Program. One source has the same list as the U.S. Visa Waiver Program but does not include Canada,[42] while another source includes Canada but excludes Ireland.[43]\\r\\nTo obtain an \\"OK to board\\", travelers must send a copy of their passport (valid for at least 6 months after planned departure from American Samoa) and a copy of their round-trip or onward ticket by email to the Attorney General's Office of American Samoa, at least 48 hours before travel. They must also pay a fee of 20 USD, before travel or on arrival.[42][43]\\r\\nTo obtain an entry permit, travelers must have a local sponsor, who must provide either a deed of private land or signatures of the sa'o (head chief) and pulenu'u (village mayor) for communal land. Travelers must also provide a round-trip or onward ticket, clearances from the High Court of American Samoa, Lyndon B. Johnson Tropical Medical Center in Pago Pago, Department of Homeland Security of American Samoa, police and health clearances from the country of origin, and pay a fee of 40 USD. The application for an entry permit must be made at least 30 days before travel. Nationals of Samoa may apply for 7-day, 14-day or 30-day permits.[44]\\r\\nResidents of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in Russia who are members of the indigenous population do not require a visa to visit Alaska if they have relatives (blood relatives, members of the same tribe, native people who have similar language and cultural heritage) in Alaska. Entry points are in Gambell and Nome.[45]\\r\\nIndividuals must be invited by a relative in Alaska, must notify local authorities at least ten days before traveling to Alaska, and must leave Alaska within 90 days.[45]\\r\\nThe agreement establishing this policy was signed by Russia and the United States on 23 September 1989. The United States made it effective as of 17 July 2015.[45]\\r\\nFollowing the expiration of the Executive Order 13780 on September 24, 2017, President Donald Trump signed a presidential proclamation suspending the issuance of visas to nationals of certain countries:[46]\\r\\nThe proclamination was scheduled to go into effect on 18 October 2017. However, on 17 October 2017, federal judge Derrick Watson of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii granted a Temporary Restraining Order to all sections of the Presidential Proclamation except for the sections targeting North Korea and Venezuela.[47] A day later, judge Theodore D. Chuang of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a preliminary injunction to \\"individuals with a bona fide relationship with an individual or entity in the United States\\" of all nationalities affected.[48]\\r\\nTherefore, from 18 October 2017, nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen may continue to apply for U.S. visas, while nationals of North Korea and Venezuela affected by the proclamation may also apply for visas if they have \\"a bona fide relationship with an individual or entity in the United States\\".[49]\\r\\nThe restrictions for Chad, North Korea and Venezuela were originally scheduled to come into effect on 18 October 2017, while the other countries were subject to the same terms of Executive Order 13780 until that date.[49]\\r\\nThe suspension does not apply to lawful permanent residents of the United States, holders of existing visas, dual nationals traveling on a passport of a non-designated country, diplomats and persons granted asylum by the United States.[50]\\r\\nWaivers may be issued by a consular or CBP officer where denying entry would cause undue hardship, would not pose a threat to the national security and public safety, and would be in the national interest.\\r\\nEffective September 13, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the State Department would stop issuing certain visas at its consular offices in the following countries due to the lack of cooperation on removal matters:[51]\\r\\nIn addition, on 29 September 2017, the U.S. halted processing of all visas except family reunification visas at its embassy in Havana, Cuba.[52] However, nationals of Cuba may still apply for visas at other U.S. embassies or consulates.[53]\\r\\nOn March 6, 2017, President Donald Trump signed a new executive order to suspend the issuance of visas to nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The policy was originally intended to be in effect on March 16, 2017,[54][55] but was postponed to June 29, 2017.\\r\\nBased on the newly issued memorandum, only individuals applying for B, C-1, C-3, D, or I visas were affected by the ban. Persons applying for visas belonging to another category (such as F, H, J or M visas) would not be affected. Individuals applying under the affected categories could still apply for a waiver which would be determined on a case-by-case basis.[56] For immigrant visa applicants, only those without a \\"bona-fide relationship\\" were affected, including those applying under the self-petitioning categories without a U.S. job offer and winners of diversity visas without a bona-fide connection to the U.S. Other categories, including family-based beneficiaries and employment-based applicants who already had jobs or job offers in the U.S., were not affected.[56]\\r\\nThe following individuals were not affected by the executive order and remained eligible to apply for visas or admission into the United States:[57]\\r\\nThe executive order superseded the previous one, and existing visas were no longer considered as revoked.[54]\\r\\nNationals of the six countries could still secure a visa if the consular officer was satisfied that they qualified for a waiver. Under the Supreme Court certiorari, waivers could be granted to persons who:[56]\\r\\nOn March 15, 2017, Federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland issued temporary injunction orders against the executive order, suspending the visa ban hours before it went into effect. The judges cited that the ban violated the Establishment Clause of the first amendment of the U.S. constitution. Trump announced that he intended to take it \\"as far as it needs to go\\", hinting that the injunction would be challenged at the Supreme Court of the United States.[58] On March 30, 2017, the temporary injunction order issued by the federal judge in Hawaii was converted into a preliminary injunction order, suspending the executive order indefinitely.[59] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and the government's request to stay the injunction, allowing the order to take effect for those without a \\"bona fide\\" relationship with a U.S. entity.[60] The implementation began at 8 p.m. Eastern Time on June 29, 2017.[61]\\r\\nA presidential executive order signed on 27 January 2017 introduced an entry ban for the nationals of certain countries for a period of 90 days, which expired on 27 April 2017. The executive order banned entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants travelling on passports issued by countries that were mentioned under the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015:[62][63]\\r\\nState Sponsors of Terrorism:\\r\\nCountries of Particular concern (designated by the Obama administration):\\r\\nThe order exempted diplomats and members of international organizations (such as the United Nations) from the ban.[64] U.S. diplomatic missions would not conduct interviews or process existing visa applications for holders of passports of these country until the ban was lifted.[65] However, Iraqi nationals who were applying for Special Immigrant Visas would be processed as normal.[64][66][67][68]\\r\\nThe guideline of the executive order later clarified that the ban applied to holders of any kind of U.S. immigrant or nonimmigrant visas from these countries except the following:[64]\\r\\nSeveral lawsuits were filed, challenging the executive order across the country. Federal senior judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington James Robart issued a temporary restraining order on the enforcement of the executive order 13769 in the case State of Washington v. Donald J. Trump on February 3, 2017. From February 4, 2017, the ban was de facto lifted and nationals of all designated countries were allowed to enter the United States.[66][67]\\r\\nThe executive order was superseded by another which also banned the ability to acquire visas for nationals of all above countries except Iraq.\\r\\nVisits to the United States Minor Outlying Islands ÿ Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, Wake Island and Navassa Island ÿ are severely restricted. Most of the islands are closed off, and prospective visitors require special permits, usually from the US army.[69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84]\\r\\nApplicants for visitor visas must show that they qualify under provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The presumption in the law is that every nonimmigrant visa applicant (except certain employment-related applicants, who are exempt) is an intending immigrant unless otherwise proven. Therefore, applicants for most nonimmigrant visas must overcome this presumption by demonstrating that:\\r\\nAll visit, business, transit, student, and exchange visitor visa applicants must pay a US$160 application fee (up from $140 as of April 2012) to a US Consulate in order to be interviewed by a Consular Officer who will determine if the applicant is qualified to receive a visa to travel to the U.S (additionally, the officer may also ask the United States Department of State for a Security Advisory Opinion, which can take several weeks to resolve). The application fee is increased to $190 for most work visas (up from $150 as of April 2012) and can be even higher for certain categories. If the applicant is rejected, the application fee is not refunded. Amongst the items included in the qualification decision are financial independence, adequate employment, material assets and a lack of a criminal record in the applicant's native country.\\r\\nIn fiscal 2016 most B-1,2 visas were issued to the nationals of the following countries (listed over 40,000 visas):[85]\\r\\nIn fiscal 2014 most reasons to refuse a visa were cited as \\"failure to establish entitlement to nonimmigrant status\\", \\"incompatible application\\" (most overcome), \\"unlawful presence\\", \\"misrepresentation\\", \\"criminal convictions\\", \\"smugglers\\" and \\"controlled substance violators\\". Smaller number of applications were rejected for \\"physical or mental disorder\\", \\"prostitution\\", \\"espionage\\", \\"terrorist activities\\", \\"falsely claiming citizenship\\" and other grounds for refusal including \\"presidential proclamation\\", \\"money laundering\\", \\"communicable disease\\" and \\"commission of acts of torture or extrajudicial killings\\".[88]\\r\\nHighest number of non-immigrant admissions for tourists and for business purposes into the United States in fiscal year 2014 and 2015 was from the following countries (listed over 700,000 admissions):[89][90]\\r\\n\\"A\\" visas are issued to representatives of a foreign government traveling to the United States to engage in official activities for that government. \\"A\\" visas are granted to foreign government ambassadors, ministers, diplomats, as well as other foreign government officials or employees traveling on official business (A-1 Visa). Certain foreign officials require an A visa regardless of the purpose of their trip. The A visa is also granted to immediate family members of such foreign government officials, defined as \\"the principal applicant's spouse and unmarried sons and daughters of any age who are not members of some other household and who will reside regularly in the household of the principal alien\\" (A-2 Visa) and which \\"may also include close relatives of the principal alien or spouse who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption who are not members of some other household; who will reside regularly in the household of the principal alien; and who are recognized as dependents by the sending government (A-3 Visa).[94]\\r\\nThe most common non-immigrant visa is the multiple-purpose B-1/B-2 visa, also known as the \\"visa for temporary visitors for business or pleasure.\\" Visa applicants sometimes receive either a B-1 (temporary visitor for business) or a B-2 (temporary visitor for pleasure) visa, if their reason for travel is specific enough that the consular officer does not feel they qualify for combined B-1/B-2 status.[95] Holders may also attend short non-credit courses. Mexican citizens are eligible for Border Crossing Cards.[96] Generally, the most important factors in judging an applicants chances of approval for a B1 business visa are as follows: Long term job or well documented successful business; and Documented consistent high level of income.[97]\\r\\nFrom November 29, 2016, all holders of Chinese passports who also hold 10-year B visas are required to enroll in the Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS) before travelling to the United States. This requirement may be extended to other nationalities in the future.[98][99]\\r\\nThe Adjusted Refusal Rate is based on the refusal rate of B visa applications. B visas are adjudicated based on applicant interviews; the interviews generally last between 60 and 90 seconds.[106] Due to time constraints, adjudicators profile applicants.[106] Certain demographics, such as young adults, those who are single and/or unemployed, almost never receive visas.[106] Adjudicators are evaluated on how fast they carry out interviews, not the quality of adjudication decisions.[107] The validity of B visa decisions is not evaluated.[107]\\r\\nTo qualify for the Visa Waiver Program, a country must have had a nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of less than 3% for the previous year or an average of no more than 2% over the past two fiscal years with neither year going above 2.5%.[108] In addition, the country must provide visa-free access to United States citizens and has to be either an independent country or a dependency of a VWP country (which has precluded Hong Kong and Macau from participating in the program.) (Until 4 April 2016, Argentina charged $160 to U.S. citizens to enter.)\\r\\nIn the table below, eligible countries are in bold, with their flag depicted and linked to their relevant individual article on Wikipedia. The Adjusted Visa Refusal Rate for B visas were as follows:\\r\\nA number of visitors overstay the maximum period of allowed stay on their B-1/B-2 status after entered the U.S. on their B-1/B-2 visas.

The only reason to enter the United States must be for transit purposes. A subtype C-2 visa is issued to diplomats transiting to and from the Headquarters of the United Nations and is limited to the vicinity of New York City. A subtype C-3 visa is issued to diplomats and their dependents transiting to and from their posted country.[121]\\r\\nD visa is issued to crew members of sea-vessels and international airlines in the United States. This includes commercial airline pilots and flight attendants, captain, engineer, or deckhand of a sea vessel, service staff on a cruise ship and trainees on board a training vessel. Usually a combination of a C-1 visa and D visa is required.[122]\\r\\nTreaty Trader (E-1 visa) and Treaty Investor (E-2 visa) visas are issued to citizens of countries that have signed treaties of commerce and navigation with the United States.[123] They are issued to individuals working in businesses engaged in substantial international trade or to investors (and their employees) who have made a 'substantial investment' in a business in the United States.[124] The variant visa issued only to citizens of Australia is the E-3 visa (E-3D visa is issued to spouse or child of E-3 visa holder and E-3R to a returning E-3 holder).[125]\\r\\nThese visas are issued for foreign students enrolled at accredited US institutions. F-1 visas are for full-time students, F2 visas are for spouses and children of F-1 visa holders and F-3 visas are for \\"border commuters\\" who reside in their country of origin while attending school in the United States.[126] They are managed through SEVIS.[127]\\r\\nThe G visas are issued to diplomats, government officials, and employees who will work for international organizations in the United States. The international organization must be officially designated as such.[128] The G-1 visa is issued to permanent mission members; the G-2 visa is issued to representatives of a recognized government traveling temporarily to attend meetings of a designated international organization; the G-3 visa is issued to persons who represent a non-recognized government; the G-4 visa is for those who are taking up an appointment; and the G-5 visa is issued to personal employees or domestic workers of G1ÿG4 visa holders.[129] G1ÿG4 visas are also issued to immediate family members of the principal visa holder, if they meet certain criteria.[130]\\r\\nOfficials who work for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization require a NATO visa. The NATO-1 visa is issued to permanent representatives of NATO and their staff members, NATO-2 visa is issued to a representative of member state to NATO or its subsidiary bodies, advisor or technical expert of the NATO delegation visiting the United States, a member of the NATO military forces component or a staff member of the NATO representative, NATO-3 visa is issued to official clerical staff accompanying the representative of a NATO member state, NATO-4 visa is issued to foreign national recognized as a NATO official, NATO-5 visa is issued to a foreign national recognized as a NATO expert and NATO-6 visa is issued to a member of the civilian component of the NATO. All NATO visas are issued to immediate family members as well. NATO-7 visas are issued to personal employees or domestic workers of a NATO-1 ÿ NATO-6 visa holders.[130]\\r\\nH visas are issued to temporary workers in the United States.\\r\\nThe discontinued H-1A and H-1C visas existed during periods when the US experienced a shortage of nurses existed from 1989. The H-1A classification was created by the Nursing Relief Act of 1989 and ended in 1995. The H-1C visa was created by the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Area Act of 1999 and expired in 2005. Currently nurses must apply for H-1B visas.[131]\\r\\nThe H-1B classification is for professional-level jobs that require a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a specific academic field. In addition, the employee must have the degree or the equivalence of such a degree through education and experience. There is a required wage, which is at least equal to the wage paid by the employer to similarly qualified workers or a prevailing wage for such positions in the geographic regions where the jobs are located. This visa also covers fashion models of distinguished merit and ability.[132][133] H-1B1 visa is the variant issued to citizens of Singapore and Chile.\\r\\nThe H-2A visa allows a foreign national entry into the US for temporary or seasonal agricultural work for eligible employers under certain conditions (seasonal job, no available US workers).[134]\\r\\nThe H-2B visa allows a foreign national entry into the US for temporary or seasonal non-agricultural work for eligible employers under certain conditions (seasonal job, no available US workers).[135]\\r\\nThe H-3 visa is available to those foreign nationals looking to \\"receive training in any field of endeavor, other than graduate medical education or training, that is not available in the foreign nationals home country\\" or \\" participate in a special education exchange visitor training program that provides for practical training and experience in the education of children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.\\".[136]\\r\\nH-4 visa is issued to immediate family members of H visa holders.

The purpose of the Act is to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges. The Exchange Visitor Program is administered by the Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. In carrying out the responsibilities of the Exchange Visitor Program, the Department designates public and private entities to act as exchange sponsors. Spouses and dependents of J-1 exchange visitors are issued a J-2 visa.[140]\\r\\nExchange visa categories are:\\r\\nExchange Visitor Pilot Programs exist for citizens of Australia,[155] Ireland,[156] New Zealand[157] and South Korea.[158]\\r\\nA K-1 visa is a visa issued to the fianc or fiance of a United States citizen to enter the United States. A K-1 visa requires a foreigner to marry his or her U.S. citizen petitioner within 90 days of entry, or depart the United States. Once the couple marries, the foreign citizen can adjust status to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States (Green Card holder).[159] K-2 visa is issued to unmarried children under the age of 21.[160] Foreign same-sex partners of United States citizens are currently recognized by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and accordingly can be sponsored for K-1 visas and for permanent resident status.[161]\\r\\nK-3/K-4 visas are issued to foreign spouses and children of US citizens.[162]\\r\\nThe L-1 classification is for international transferees who have worked for a related organization abroad for at least one continuous year in the past three years and who will be coming to the United States to work in an executive or managerial (L-1A) or specialized knowledge capacity (L-1B).[163] L-2 visa is issued to dependent spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age of qualified L-1 visa holders.\\r\\nThe M-1 visa is a type of student visa reserved for vocational and technical schools. Students in M-1 status may not work on or off campus while studying, and they may not change their status to F-1. The M-2 visa permits the spouse and minor children of an M-1 vocational student to accompany him or her to the United States.[126]\\r\\nO visa is a classification of non-immigrant temporary worker visa granted to an alien \\"who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics (O-1A visa), or who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and has been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements,\\" (O-1B visa) and to certain assistants (O-2 visa) and immediate family members of such aliens (O-3 visa).[164]\\r\\nP visas are issued to individuals or team athletes, or member of an entertainment group including persons providing essential support services (P-1 visa), artists or entertainers (individual or group) under a reciprocal exchange program (P-2 visa) and artists or entertainers (individual or group) visiting to perform, teach or coach under a program that is culturally unique.[165] P-4 visas are issued to spouses, or children under the age of 21, of a P-1, P-2, or P-3 alien and who is accompanying, or following to join.\\r\\nQ visa is issued to participants in an international cultural exchange program.[165]\\r\\nR-1 visa is issued to temporary religious workers.

There is a limit of 200 S visas a year.[168] A law enforcement agency can then submit an application for resident alien status i.e., a green card on behalf of the witness or informant once the individual has completed the terms and conditions of his or her S visa.[169]\\r\\nNAFTA Professional (TN) visa allows citizens of Canada and Mexico whose profession is on the NAFTA list[170] and who must hold a bachelor's degree to work in the United States on a prearranged job. Canadian citizens usually do not require a visa to work under the TN status (unless they live outside Canada with non-Canadian family members) while Mexican citizens require a TN visa. Spouse and dependent children of a TN professional can be admitted into the United States in the TD status.[171]\\r\\nU-1 visa is a nonimmigrant visa which is set aside for victims of crimes (and their immediate family members) who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement and government officials in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity.[172] Subtypes of this visa are U-2 issued to spouses of U-1, U-3 issued to children of U-1, U-4 issued to parents of U-1 under the age of 21 and U-5 issued to unmarried siblings under the age of 18 of U-1 who is under 21.\\r\\nT-1 visa is issued to victims of severe forms of human trafficking.

It allows permanent residents to achieve family unity with their spouses and children while the immigration process takes its course. It was created by the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act of 2000.[174] The Act is to relieve those who applied for immigrant visas on or before December 21, 2000. Practically, the V visa is currently not available to spouses and minor children of LPRs who have applied after December 21, 2000.[175]\\r\\nAll US visa types and subtypes are listed below:[176][177]\\r\\n(subgroup numerical limit)\\r\\n[179][180][181]\\r\\n* Persons with H-1B visas, H-4 visas (as immediate family members of H-1B visa holders), K visas, L visas, and V visas are permitted to have dual intent under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Federal regulations also appear to recognize dual intent O visas, P visas, and E visas.\\r\\nThe concept of dual intent visa is to grant legal status to certain types of visa applicants when they are in the process of applying for a visa with the intent to obtain a permanent residency/green card. There are a certain number of U.S. visa categories that grant permission for dual intent, or to get a temporary visa status while having an intention to get a green card and stay permanently in the United States of America[citation needed].\\r\\nMost visas are named after the paragraph of the Code of Federal Regulations that established the visa.[182]\\r\\nSection 221(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act defined several classes of aliens ineligible to receive visas.\\r\\nGrounds for denial may include, but are not limited to:\\r\\nSection 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (also cited as 8 United States Code  1184(b))[183] states that most aliens must be presumed to be intending to remain in the US, until and unless they are able to show that they are entitled to non-immigrant status. This means there are two sides to a 214(b) denial. Either\\r\\nAn example of a denial based upon the first ground would be an applicant for an F-1 student visa who the consular officer felt was secretly intending to remain in the US permanently.\\r\\nAn example of a denial based upon the second ground would be an H-1B applicant who couldnt prove he possessed the equivalent of a US bachelors degree in a specialty fieldsuch an equivalency being a requirement for obtaining an H-1B visa.\\r\\nIn order to thereafter obtain a visa applicants are recommended to objectively evaluate their situation, see in what way they fell short of the visa requirements, and then reapply.[184]\\r\\nIn 2005, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (then Chief Minister of Gujarat) was denied a diplomatic visa to the United States. In addition, the B-1/B-2 visa that had previously been granted to him was also revoked, under a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act which makes any foreign government official who was responsible or \\"directly carried out, at any time, particularly severe violations of religious freedom\\" ineligible for the visa.[185] Modi is the only person ever denied a visa to the U.S. under this provision.[186]\\r\\nThere are cases when a US visa has been granted to aliens who were technically ineligible. Japanese mafia (yakuza) leader Tadamasa Goto and three others were issued visas for travel between 2000 and 2004 to undergo liver transplant surgery at UCLA Medical Center.[187] The FBI had aided the men in the visa application process hoping that they would provide information regarding yakuza activities in the US.[187]\\r\\n1 British Overseas Territories. 2 Open border with Schengen Area. 3 Russia is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.

Though the language in some of Act 746 had created confusion over the legalities of open and concealed carry without a permit with some state officials and law enforcement it has since been amended to correct these confusions and goes on to describe the specific instances and places where it is legal to carry a weapon and in no way legally overrides the law of a license required for conceal carry in the state.\\r\\nBackground on the confusion that surrounded Act 746:\\r\\nWhile Constitutional gun rights advocates and most law enforcement agencies have tried to argue that Act 746 legalizes open and concealed carry in Arkansas without a permit, Attorney General Dustin McDaniel at the time, issued a non-binding opinion on July 8, 2013 stating that Act 746 applies only to persons who are carrying firearms while \\"on a journey across or through Arkansas,\\" that open carry remains illegal and that a valid permit is still required for concealed carry for those who are not traveling across Arkansas. In his opinion written to State Senator Eddie Joe Williams, Attorney General McDaniel defined a journey as \\"travel beyond one's county of residence,\\" but further stated it would be ultimately up to the discretion of law enforcement officials and county prosecutors as to whether or not persons carrying without a valid permit would be arrested and prosecuted.[5] The Arkansas Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on this issue.\\r\\nAs of August 2015 Attorney General Leslie Rutledge has also issued a non-binding opinion that open carry is legal while not affecting concealed carry, a concealed carry license is still required. Her opinion can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040540/http://ag.arkansas.gov/opinions/docs/2015-064.html with the following extracts noted:\\r\\nOpinions on open carry:\\r\\nIn my opinion, Act 746s amendments to  5-73-120 mean that (1) the statute only criminalizes a persons possess[ing] a handgun on or about his or her person, in a vehicle occupied by the person, or otherwise readily available for use if he or she simultaneously has the intent to attempt to unlawfully employ the handgunas a weapon against a person, and (2) this unlawful intent may not be presumed simply because that person possesses a loaded handgun.\\r\\nOpinions on Concealed Carry:\\r\\nNothing in Act 746,  5-73-120(a), or this opinion is intended to suggest a person may carry a concealed handgun in public without a properly issued concealed-carry license. In fact, except during a journey, it is likely that the Arkansas Supreme Court would allow the presumption that a person who has flouted the concealed-carry licensing scheme in Arkansas law by possessing a concealed handgun without a concealed-carry license has the requisite unlawful intent for a violation of  5-73-120(a).\\r\\nPoint 4 requires additional explanation. In my opinion, a person may not lawfully carry a concealed handgun in public without a properly issued concealed-carry license. I believe this necessarily follows from the concealed-carry licensing scheme that predates Act 746 and that, in my opinion, was unaffected by Act 746. The licensing requirement is recognized in the concealed handgun exception under  5-73-120:\\r\\nAttorney General Leslie Rutledge has also stated that open carry may generate reasonable suspicion for an officer to stop and briefly detain a person.[6]\\r\\n[A]ny person who carries a handgun should be aware that a law enforcement officer might lawfully inquire into that persons purpose. Determining culpability or potential culpability under Ark. Code Ann.  5-73-120 is initially a matter for law enforcement following guidelines that routinely apply when investigating a misdemeanor involving the danger of forcible injury to persons. A law enforcement officer may stop and detain any person reasonably suspected of violating  5-73-120 if necessary to identify the person or determine the lawfulness of his or her conduct.\\r\\nWhether an officer has reasonable suspicion will depend upon a number of circumstance-specific factors. Some of these factors are recounted in Ark. Code Ann.  16-81-203 (Repl. 2005), including: (1) the demeanor of the suspect; (2) the gait and manner of the suspect; (3) any information received from third persons; and (4) the suspects proximity to known criminal conduct. While merely possessing a loaded handgun completely on its own is not enough for reasonable suspicion of a violation of  5-73-120(a), possessing a loaded handgun in combination with just one additional factor may, depending on the circumstances, be enough to create reasonable suspicion of intent to unlawfully employ the handgun as a weapon (and thus reasonable suspicion of a violation of  5-73-120(a)).\\r\\n Opinion No. 2015-064 by Attorney General Leslie Rutledge\\r\\nDespite these non-binding opinions, most local courts have thrown out or dropped the charges on carrying a weapon. One case was ruled guilty in a lower court in Bald Knob. The defendant appealed and the court dismissed the case potentially setting a precedent that open carry is legal.[7][8] Regardless of what some state or law enforcement officials' views are on Act 746, most agencies and citizens agree with sponsors of the Act, that Arkansas is a Constitutional Carry state. Since this is not clearly in law currently, one should still proceed with reasonable caution. checking with the most recent and relevant local and state laws as well as the relevant legal agencies before attempting to legally carry the weapon.\\r\\nArkansas Attorney General Opinion No. 2015-064 Retrieved 10 December 2016","input":"What is the concealed carry law in arkansas?"},{"output":"East St. Paul Curling Club","context":"The 2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Canada's national women's curling championship, was held from January 27ÿFebruary 4, 2018 at the South Okanagan Events Centre in Penticton, British Columbia.

Missouri was the last battleship commissioned by the United States and is best remembered as the site of the surrender of the Empire of Japan which ended World War II.\\r\\nMissouri was ordered in 1940 and commissioned in June 1944. In the Pacific Theater of World War II she fought in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and shelled the Japanese home islands, and she fought in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. She was decommissioned in 1955 into the United States Navy reserve fleets (the \\"Mothball Fleet\\"), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan, and provided fire support during Operation Desert Storm in January/February 1991.\\r\\nMissouri received a total of 11 battle stars for service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf, and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992 after serving a total of 16 years of active service, but remained on the Naval Vessel Register until her name was struck in January 1995. In 1998, she was donated to the USS Missouri Memorial Association and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMissouri was one of the Iowa-class \\"fast battleship\\" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair. She was laid down at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 6 January 1941, launched on 29 January 1944 and commissioned on 11 June with Captain William Callaghan in command. The ship was the third of the Iowa class, but the fourth and final Iowa-class ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy.[1][2][3][4] The ship was christened at her launching by Mary Margaret Truman, daughter of Harry S. Truman, then a United States Senator from Missouri.[5]\\r\\nMissouri's main battery consisted of nine 16?in (406?mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns, which could fire 2,700?lb (1,200?kg) armor-piercing shells some 20?mi (32.2?km). Her secondary battery consisted of twenty 5?in (127?mm)/38 cal guns in twin turrets, with a range of about 10?mi (16?km). With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain air superiority came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers; to this end, Missouri was fitted with an array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes. When reactivated in 1984 Missouri had her 20?mm and 40?mm AA guns removed, and was outfitted with Phalanx CIWS mounts for protection against enemy missiles and aircraft, and Armored Box Launchers and Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire Tomahawk missiles and Harpoon missiles, respectively.[6] Missouri and her sister ship Wisconsin were fitted with thicker traverse bulkhead armor, 14.5 inches (368?mm), compared to 11.3 inches (287?mm) in the first two ships of her class, the Iowa and New Jersey.[7]\\r\\nMissouri was the last U.S. battleship to be completed.[2][8] Wisconsin, the highest-numbered U.S. battleship built, was completed before Missouri; BB-65 to BB-71 were ordered but cancelled.\\r\\nAfter trials off New York and shakedown and battle practice in the Chesapeake Bay, Missouri departed Norfolk, Virginia on 11 November 1944, transited the Panama Canal on 18 November and steamed to San Francisco for final fitting out as fleet flagship. She stood out of San Francisco Bay on 14 December and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 24 December 1944. She departed Hawaii on 2 January 1945 and arrived in Ulithi, West Caroline Islands on 13 January. There she was temporary headquarters ship for Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher. The battleship put to sea on 27 January to serve in the screen of the Lexington carrier task group of Mitscher's TF 58, and on 16 February the task force's aircraft carriers launched the first naval air strikes against Japan since the famed Doolittle raid, which had been launched from the carrier Hornet in April 1942.[5]\\r\\nMissouri then steamed with the carriers to Iwo Jima where her main guns provided direct and continuous support to the invasion landings begun on 19 February. After TF 58 returned to Ulithi on 5 March, Missouri was assigned to the Yorktown carrier task group. On 14 March, Missouri departed Ulithi in the screen of the fast carriers and steamed to the Japanese mainland. During strikes against targets along the coast of the Inland Sea of Japan beginning on 18 March, Missouri shot down four Japanese aircraft.[5]\\r\\nRaids against airfields and naval bases near the Inland Sea and southwestern Honsh continued. When the carrier Franklin incurred battle damage, the Missouri's carrier task group provided cover for the Franklin's retirement toward Ulithi until 22 March, then set course for pre-invasion strikes and bombardment of Okinawa.[5]\\r\\nMissouri joined the fast battleships of TF 58 in bombarding the southeast coast of Okinawa on 24 March, an action intended to draw enemy strength from the west coast beaches that would be the actual site of invasion landings. Missouri rejoined the screen of the carriers as Marine and Army units stormed the shores of Okinawa on the morning of 1 April. An attack by Japanese forces was repulsed successfully.[5]\\r\\nOn 11 April, a low-flying kamikaze Zero, although fired upon, crashed on Missouri's starboard side, just below her main deck level. The starboard wing of the plane was thrown far forward, starting a gasoline fire at 5?in (127?mm) Gun Mount No. 3. The battleship suffered only superficial damage, and the fire was brought quickly under control.[5] The remains of the pilot were recovered on board the ship just aft of one of the 40?mm gun tubs. Although crewmen wanted to hose the remains over the deck, Captain Callaghan decided that the young Japanese pilot had done his job to the best of his ability, and with honor, so he should be given a military funeral. The following day he was buried at sea with military honors.[9]\\r\\nAbout 23:05 on 17 April, Missouri detected an enemy submarine 12?mi (19?km) from her formation. Her report set off a hunter-killer operation by the light carrier Bataan and four destroyers, which sank the Japanese submarine I-56.[5]\\r\\nMissouri was detached from the carrier task force off Okinawa on 5 May and sailed for Ulithi. During the Okinawa campaign she had shot down five enemy planes, assisted in the destruction of six others, and scored one probable kill. She helped repel 12 daylight attacks of enemy raiders and fought off four night attacks on her carrier task group. Her shore bombardment destroyed several gun emplacements and many other military, governmental, and industrial structures.[5]\\r\\nMissouri arrived at Ulithi on 9 May and then proceeded to Apra Harbor, Guam, arriving on 18 May.[5] That afternoon Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., Commander Third Fleet, brought his staff from cruiser Louisville onto the Missouri.[10] She passed out of the harbor on 21 May, and by 27 May was again conducting shore bombardment against Japanese positions on Okinawa. Missouri led the 3rd Fleet in strikes on airfields and installations on Kysh on 2ÿ3 June. She rode out a fierce storm on 5 and 6 June. Some topside fittings were smashed, but Missouri suffered no major damage. Her fleet again struck Kysh on 8 June, then hit hard in a coordinated air-surface bombardment before retiring towards Leyte. She arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte on 13 June, after almost three months of continuous operations in support of the Okinawa campaign.[5]\\r\\nHere she rejoined the powerful 3rd Fleet in strikes at the heart of Japan from within its home waters. The fleet set a northerly course on 8 July to approach the Japanese main island, Honsh. Raids took Tokyo by surprise on 10 July, followed by more devastation at the juncture of Honsh and Hokkaid, the second-largest Japanese island, on 13ÿ14 July. For the first time, naval gunfire destroyed a major installation within the home islands when Missouri joined in a shore bombardment on 15 July that severely damaged the Nihon Steel Co. and the Wanishi Ironworks at Muroran, Hokkaido.[5]\\r\\nDuring the nights of 17 and 18 July, Missouri bombarded industrial targets in Honsh. Inland Sea aerial strikes continued through 25 July, and Missouri guarded the carriers as they attacked the Japanese home islands.[5]\\r\\nStrikes on Hokkaid and northern Honsh resumed on 9 August, the day the second atomic bomb was dropped.[5]\\r\\nAfter the Japanese agreed to surrender, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser of the Royal Navy, the Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, boarded Missouri on 16 August and conferred the honour of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire upon Admiral Halsey. Missouri transferred a landing party of 200 officers and men to the battleship Iowa for temporary duty with the initial occupation force for Tokyo on 21 August. Missouri herself entered Tokyo Bay early on 29 August to prepare for the signing by Japan of the official instrument of surrender.[5]\\r\\nHigh-ranking military officials of all the Allied Powers were received on board on 2 September, including Chinese General Hsu Yung-Ch'ang, British Admiral-of-the-Fleet Sir Bruce Fraser, Soviet Lieutenant-General Kuzma Nikolaevich Derevyanko, Australian General Sir Thomas Blamey, Canadian Colonel Lawrence Moore Cosgrave, French Gnral d'Arme Philippe Leclerc de Hautecloque, Dutch Vice Admiral Conrad Emil Lambert Helfrich, and New Zealand Air Vice Marshal Leonard M. Isitt.\\r\\nFleet Admiral Chester Nimitz boarded shortly after 0800, and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allies, came on board at 0843. The Japanese representatives, headed by Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, arrived at 0856. At 0902, General MacArthur stepped before a battery of microphones and opened the 23-minute surrender ceremony to the waiting world by stating,[5] \\"It is my earnest hopeindeed the hope of all mankindthat from this solemn occasion a better world shall emerge out of the blood and carnage of the past, a world founded upon faith and understanding, a world dedicated to the dignity of man and the fulfillment of his most cherished wish for freedom, tolerance, and justice.\\"[11]\\r\\nDuring the surrender ceremony, the deck of Missouri was decorated with a 31-star American flag that had been taken ashore by Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 after his squadron of \\"Black Ships\\" sailed into Tokyo Bay to force the opening of Japan's ports to foreign trade. This flag was actually displayed with the reverse side showing, i.e., stars in the upper right corner: the historic flag was so fragile that the conservator at the Naval Academy Museum had sewn a protective linen backing to one side to help secure the fabric from deteriorating, leaving its \\"wrong side\\" visible. The flag was displayed in a wood-framed case secured to the bulkhead overlooking the surrender ceremony.[12] Another U.S. flag was raised and flown during the occasion, a flag that some sources have indicated was in fact that flag which had flown over the U.S. Capitol on 7 December 1941. This is not true; it was a flag taken from the ship's stock, according to Missouri's commanding officer, Captain Stuart \\"Sunshine\\" Murray, and it was \\"...just a plain ordinary GI-issue flag\\".[13]\\r\\nBy 09:30 the Japanese emissaries had departed. In the afternoon of 5 September, Admiral Halsey transferred his flag to the battleship South Dakota, and early the next day Missouri departed Tokyo Bay. As part of the ongoing Operation Magic Carpet she received homeward bound passengers at Guam, then sailed unescorted for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 20 September and flew Admiral Nimitz's flag on the afternoon of 28 September for a reception.[5]\\r\\nThe next day, Missouri departed Pearl Harbor bound for the eastern seaboard of the United States. She reached New York City on 23 October and hoisted the flag of Atlantic Fleet commander Admiral Jonas Ingram. Four days later, Missouri boomed out a 21-gun salute as President Truman boarded for Navy Day ceremonies.[5]\\r\\nAfter an overhaul in the New York Naval Shipyard and a training cruise to Cuba, Missouri returned to New York. During the afternoon of 21 March 1946, she received the remains of the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Mnir Ertegn. She departed on 22 March for Gibraltar, and on 5 April anchored in the Bosphorus off Istanbul. She rendered full honors, including the firing of 19-gun salutes during the transfer of the remains of the late ambassador and again during the funeral ashore.[5]\\r\\nMissouri departed Istanbul on 9 April and entered Phaleron Bay, Piraeus, Greece, the following day for an overwhelming welcome by Greek government officials and anti-communist citizens. Greece had become the scene of a civil war between the communist World War II resistance movement and the returning Greek government-in-exile. The United States saw this as an important test case for its new doctrine of containment of the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pushing for concessions in the Dodecanese to be included in the peace treaty with Italy and for access through the Dardanelles strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The voyage of Missouri to the eastern Mediterranean symbolized America's strategic commitment to the region. News media proclaimed her a symbol of U.S. interest in preserving both nations' independence.[5]\\r\\nMissouri departed Piraeus on 26 April, touching at Algiers and Tangiers before arriving at Norfolk on 9 May. She departed for Culebra Island on 12 May to join Admiral Mitscher's 8th Fleet in the Navy's first large-scale postwar Atlantic training maneuvers. The battleship returned to New York City on 27 May, and spent the next year steaming Atlantic coastal waters north to the Davis Strait and south to the Caribbean on various Atlantic command training exercises.[5] On 13 December, during a target practice exercise in the North Atlantic, a star shell accidentally struck the battleship, but without causing injuries.[14]\\r\\nMissouri arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 30 August 1947 for the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Hemisphere Peace and Security. President Truman boarded on 2 September to celebrate the signing of the Rio Treaty, which broadened the Monroe Doctrine by stipulating that an attack on any one of the signatory American countries would be considered an attack on all.[5]\\r\\nThe Truman family boarded Missouri on 7 September 1947 to return to the United States and disembarked at Norfolk on 19 September. Her overhaul in New Yorkwhich lasted from 23 September to 10 March 1948was followed by refresher training at Guantanamo Bay. The summer of 1948 was devoted to midshipman and reserve training cruises. Also in 1948, the Big Mo became the first battleship to host a helicopter detachment, operating two Sikorsky HO3S-1 machines for utility and rescue work.[15] The battleship departed Norfolk on 1 November 1948 for a second three-week Arctic cold-weather training cruise to the Davis Strait. During the next two years, Missouri participated in Atlantic command exercises from the New England coast to the Caribbean, alternated with two midshipman summer training cruises. She was overhauled at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 23 September 1949 to 17 January 1950.[5]\\r\\nThroughout the latter half of the 1940s, the various service branches of the United States had been reducing their inventories from their World War II levels. For the Navy, this resulted in several vessels of various types being decommissioned and either sold for scrap or placed in one of the various United States Navy reserve fleets scattered along the East and West Coast of the United States. As part of this contraction, three of the Iowa-class battleships had been de-activated and decommissioned; however, President Truman refused to allow Missouri to be decommissioned. Against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter Margaret Truman.[16][17]\\r\\nThen the only U.S. battleship in commission, Missouri was proceeding seaward on a training mission from Hampton Roads early on 17 January 1950 when she ran aground 1.6?mi (2.6?km) from Thimble Shoal Light, near Old Point Comfort. She hit shoal water a distance of three ship-lengths from the main channel. Lifted some 7 feet (2.1?m) above waterline, she stuck hard and fast.[5] With the aid of tugboats, pontoons, and a rising tide, she was refloated on 1 February 1950 and repaired.[5]\\r\\nIn 1950, the Korean War broke out, prompting the United States to intervene in the name of the United Nations. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck,[18] but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula.[5]\\r\\nMissouri arrived just west of Kysh on 14 September, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Allan Edward Smith. The first American battleship to reach Korean waters, she bombarded Samchok on 15 September 1950 in an attempt to divert troops and attention from the Incheon landings. This was the first time since World War II that Missouri had fired her guns in anger, and in company with the cruiser Helena and two destroyers, she helped prepare the way for the U.S. Eighth Army offensive.[5]\\r\\nMissouri arrived at Incheon on 19 September, and on 10 October became flagship of Rear Admiral J. M. Higgins, commander, Cruiser Division 5 (CruDiv 5). She arrived at Sasebo on 14 October, where she became flagship of Vice Admiral A. D. Struble, Commander, 7th Fleet. After screening the aircraft carrier Valley Forge along the east coast of Korea, she conducted bombardment missions from 12 to 26 October in the Chongjin and Tanchon areas, and at Wonsan where she again screened carriers eastward of Wonsan.[5]\\r\\nMacArthur's amphibious landings at Incheon had severed the North Korean Armys supply lines; as a result, North Koreas army had begun a lengthy retreat from South Korea into North Korea. This retreat was closely monitored by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), out of fear that the UN offensive against Korea would create a US-backed enemy on Chinas border, and out of concern that the UN offensive in Korea could evolve into a UN war against China. The latter of these two threats had already manifested itself during the Korea War: U.S. F-86 Sabres on patrol in \\"MiG Alley\\" frequently crossed into China while pursuing Communist MiGs operating out of Chinese airbases.[19]\\r\\nMoreover, there was talk among the U.N. commandersnotably General Douglas MacArthurabout a potential campaign against the People's Republic of China. In an effort to dissuade UN forces from completely overrunning North Korea, the People's Republic of China issued diplomatic warnings that they would use force to protect North Korea, but these warnings were not taken seriously for a number of reasons, among them the fact that China lacked air cover to conduct such an attack.[20][21] This changed abruptly on 19 October 1950, when the first of an eventual total of 380,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers under the command of General Peng Dehuai crossed into North Korea, launching a full-scale assault against advancing U.N. troops. The PRC offensive caught the UN completely by surprise; UN forces realized they would have to fall back, and quickly executed an emergency retreat. UN assets were shuffled in order to cover this retreat, and as part of the force tasked with covering the UN retreat Missouri was moved into Hungnam on 23 December to provide gunfire support about the Hungnam defense perimeter until the last UN troops, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, were evacuated by way of the sea on 24 December 1950.[5]\\r\\nMissouri conducted additional operations with carriers and shore bombardments off the east coast of Korea until 19 March 1951. She arrived at Yokosuka on 24 March, and 4 days later was relieved of duty in the Far East. She departed Yokosuka on 28 March, and upon arrival at Norfolk on 27 April became the flagship of Rear Admiral James L. Holloway, Jr., commander, Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet. During the summer of 1951, she engaged in two midshipman training cruises to northern Europe. Under the command of Captain John Sylvester, Missouri entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard 18 October 1951 for an overhaul, which lasted until 30 January 1952.[5]\\r\\nFollowing winter and spring training out of Guantanamo Bay, Missouri visited New York, then set course from Norfolk on 9 June 1952 for another midshipman cruise. She returned to Norfolk on 4 August and entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard to prepare for a second tour in the Korean combat zone.[5]\\r\\nMissouri stood out of Hampton Roads on 11 September 1952 and arrived at Yokosuka on 17 October. Vice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, commander of the 7th Fleet, brought his staff onboard on 19 October. Her primary mission was to provide seagoing artillery support by bombarding enemy targets in the Chaho-Tanchon area, at Chongjin, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and at Chaho, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Hungnam during the period 25 October through 2 January 1953.[5]\\r\\nMissouri put into Incheon on 5 January 1953 and sailed thence to Sasebo, Japan. General Mark W. Clark, Commander in Chief, U.N. Command, and Admiral Sir Guy Russell, the Royal Navy commander of the British Far East Station, visited the battleship on 23 January. In the following weeks, Missouri resumed \\"Cobra\\" patrol along the east coast of Korea to support troops ashore. Repeated bombardment of Wonsan, Tanehon, Hungnam, and Kojo destroyed main supply routes along the eastern seaboard of Korea.[5]\\r\\nThe last bombardment mission by Missouri was against the Kojo area on 25 March. On 26 March, her commanding officerÿCaptain Warner R. Edsallÿsuffered a fatal heart attack while conning her through the submarine net at Sasebo. She was relieved as the 7th Fleet flagship on 6 April by her older sister New Jersey.[5]\\r\\nMissouri departed Yokosuka on 7 April and arrived at Norfolk on 4 May to become flagship for Rear Admiral E. T. Woolridge, commander, Battleships-Cruisers, Atlantic Fleet, on 14 May. She departed on 8 June on a midshipman training cruise, returned to Norfolk on 4 August, and was overhauled in Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 20 November 1953 to 2 April 1954. As the flagship of Rear Admiral R. E. Kirby, who had relieved Admiral Woolridge, Missouri departed Norfolk on 7 June as flagship of the midshipman training cruise to Lisbon and Cherbourg. During this voyage Missouri was joined by the other three battleships of her class, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Iowa, the only time the four ships sailed together.[22] She returned to Norfolk on 3 August and departed on 23 August for inactivation on the West Coast. After calls at Long Beach and San Francisco, Missouri arrived in Seattle on 15 September. Three days later she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard where she was decommissioned on 26 February 1955, entering the Bremerton group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.[5]\\r\\nUpon arrival in Bremerton, Missouri was moored at the last pier of the reserve fleet berthing. This placed her very close to the mainland, and she served as a popular tourist attraction, logging about 180,000 visitors per year, who came to view the \\"surrender deck\\" where a bronze plaque memorialized the spot (35 21' 17\\" N, 139 45' 36\\" E) where Japan surrendered to the Allies, and the accompanying historical display that included copies of the surrender documents and photos. A small cottage industry grew in the civilian community just outside the gates, selling souvenirs and other memorabilia. Nearly thirty years passed before Missouri returned to active duty.[5]\\r\\nUnder the Reagan Administrations program to build a 600-ship Navy, led by Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, Missouri was reactivated and towed by the salvage ship Beaufort to the Long Beach Naval Yard in the summer of 1984 to undergo modernization in advance of her scheduled recommissioning.[5] In preparation for the move, a skeleton crew of 20 spent three weeks working 12- to 16-hour days preparing the battleship for her tow.[23] During the modernization Missouri had her obsolete armament removed: 20?mm and 40?mm anti-aircraft guns, and four of her ten 5-inch (130?mm) gun mounts.[24]\\r\\nOver the next several months, the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher (ABL) mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System (CIWS) Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft.[24] Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities.[24] During the modernization Missouri's 800?lb (360?kg) bell, which had been removed from the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning.[25] Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986. \\"This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power\\", Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to \\"listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They speak to you of honor and the importance of duty. They remind you of your own traditions.\\"[26] Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor John Ashcroft, U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, and Margaret Truman, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ships crew, which ended with words \\"now take care of my baby\\". Her remarks were met with rounds of sincere applause from the crew.[27]\\r\\nFour months later Missouri departed from her new home port of Long Beach for an around-the-world cruise, visiting Pearl Harbor Hawaii; Sydney, Hobart, and Perth, Australia; Diego Garcia; the Suez Canal; Istanbul, Turkey; Naples, Italy; Rota, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; and the Panama Canal. Missouri became the first American battleship to circumnavigate the globe since Theodore Roosevelt's \\"Great White Fleet\\" 80 years before?ÿ a fleet which included the first battleship named USS?Missouri?(BB-11).[5]\\r\\nIn 1987, Missouri was outfitted with 40?mm grenade launchers and 25?mm chain guns and sent to take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.[28] These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating in the Persian Gulf at the time.[29] On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment?ÿ a striking contrast to her world cruise months earlier. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, Missouri escorted tanker convoys into the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire control system trained on land-based Iranian Silkworm missile launchers.[30]\\r\\nMissouri returned to the United States via Diego Garcia, Australia and Hawaii in early 1988. Several months later, Missouri's crew again headed for Hawaiian waters for the Rim of the Pacific (RimPac) exercises, which involved more than 50,000 troops and ships from the navies of Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States. Port visits in 1988 included Vancouver and Victoria in Canada, San Diego, Seattle, and Bremerton.[5]\\r\\nIn the early months of 1989, Missouri was in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for routine maintenance. On 1 July 1989, while berthed at Pier D, the music video for Cher's If I Could Turn Back Time was filmed aboard Missouri and featured the ship's crew. A few months later she departed for Pacific Exercise (PacEx) '89, where she and New Jersey performed a simultaneous gunfire demonstration for the aircraft carriers Enterprise and Nimitz. The highlight of PacEx was a port visit in Pusan, Republic of Korea. In 1990, Missouri again took part in the RimPac Exercise with ships from Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, and the U.S.[5]\\r\\nOn 2 August 1990 Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait. In the middle of the month U.S. President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support, to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multinational force in a standoff with Iraq.\\r\\nMissouri's scheduled four-month Western Pacific port-to-port cruise set to begin in September was canceled just a few days before the ship was to leave. She had been placed on hold in anticipation of being mobilized as forces continued to mass in the Middle East. Missouri departed on 13 November 1990 for the troubled waters of the Persian Gulf. She departed from Pier 6 at Long Beach, with extensive press coverage, and headed for Hawaii and the Philippines for more work-ups en route to the Persian Gulf. Along the way she made stops at Subic Bay and Pattaya Beach, Thailand, before transiting the Strait of Hormuz on 3 January 1991. During subsequent operations leading up to Operation Desert Storm, Missouri prepared to launch Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and provide naval gunfire support as required.[5]\\r\\nMissouri fired her first Tomahawk missile at Iraqi targets at 01:40?am on 17 January 1991, followed by 27 additional missiles over the next five days.[5]\\r\\nOn 29 January, the Oliver Hazard Perry-class?frigate Curts led Missouri northward, using advanced mine-avoidance sonar. In her first naval gunfire support action of Desert Storm she shelled an Iraqi command and control bunker near the Saudi border, the first time her 16?in (410?mm) guns had been fired in combat since March 1953 off Korea.[31] The battleship bombarded Iraqi beach defenses in occupied Kuwait on the night of 3 February, firing 112 16?in (410?mm) rounds over the next three days until relieved by Wisconsin. Missouri then fired another 60 rounds off Khafji on 11ÿ12 February before steaming north to Faylaka Island. After minesweepers cleared a lane through Iraqi defenses, Missouri fired 133 rounds during four shore bombardment missions as part of the amphibious landing feint against the Kuwaiti shore line the morning of 23 February.[5] The heavy pounding attracted Iraqi attention; in response to the battleships artillery strike, the Iraqis fired two HY-2 Silkworm missiles at the battleship, one of which missed.[32] The other missile was intercepted by a GWS-30 Sea Dart missile launched from the British air defence destroyer HMS?Gloucester[5] within 90 seconds and crashed into the sea roughly 700?yd (640?m) in front of Missouri.[33]\\r\\nDuring the campaign, Missouri was involved in a friendly fire incident with the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate Jarrett. According to the official report, on 25 February, Jarrett's Phalanx CIWS engaged the chaff fired by Missouri as a countermeasure against enemy missiles, and stray rounds from the firing struck Missouri, one penetrating through a bulkhead and becoming embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. Another round struck the ship on the forward funnel, passing completely through it. One sailor aboard Missouri was struck in the neck by flying shrapnel and suffered minor injuries. Those familiar with the incident are skeptical of this account, however, as Jarrett was reportedly over 2?mi (3.2?km) away at the time and the characteristics of chaff are such that a Phalanx would not normally regard it as a threat and engage it.[34] There is no dispute that the rounds that struck Missouri did come from Jarrett, and that it was an accident. The suspicion is that a Phalanx operator on Jarrett may have accidentally fired off a few rounds manually, although there is no evidence to support this.[35][36]\\r\\nDuring the operation, Missouri also assisted coalition forces engaged in clearing Iraqi naval mines in the Persian Gulf. By the time the war ended, Missouri had destroyed at least 15 naval mines.[33]\\r\\nWith combat operations out of range of the battleships weapons on 26 February, Missouri had fired a total 783 rounds of 16?in (410?mm) shells and launched 28 Tomahawk cruise missiles during the campaign,[37] and commenced to conduct patrol and armistice enforcement operations in the northern Persian Gulf until sailing for home on 21 March. Following stops at Fremantle and Hobart, Australia, the warship visited Pearl Harbor before arriving home in April. She spent the remainder of the year conducting type training and other local operations, the latter including 7 December \\"voyage of remembrance\\" to mark the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. During that ceremony, Missouri hosted President George H. W. Bush, the first such presidential visit for the warship since Harry S. Truman boarded the battleship in September 1947.[5]\\r\\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, Missouri was decommissioned on 31 March 1992 at Long Beach, California after 16 total years of active service.[1] Her last commanding officer, Captain Albert L. Kaiss, wrote in the ship's final Plan of the Day:\\r\\nOur final day has arrived. Today the final chapter in battleship Missouris history will be written. It's often said that the crew makes the command. There is no truer statement ... for it's the crew of this great ship that made this a great command. You are a special breed of sailors and Marines and I am proud to have served with each and every one of you. To you who have made the painful journey of putting this great lady to sleep, I thank you. For you have had the toughest job. To put away a ship that has become as much a part of you as you are to her is a sad ending to a great tour. But take solace in thisyou have lived up to the history of the ship and those who sailed her before us. We took her to war, performed magnificently and added another chapter in her history, standing side by side our forerunners in true naval tradition. God bless you all.\\r\\nMissouri returned to be part of the United States Navy reserve fleet at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, until 12 January 1995, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She remained in Bremerton, but was not open to tourists as she had been from 1957 to 1984. In spite of attempts by citizens' groups to keep her in Bremerton and be re-opened as a tourist site, the U.S. Navy wanted to pair a symbol of the end of World War II with one representing its beginning.[38] On 4 May 1998, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton signed the donation contract that transferred her to the nonprofit USS Missouri Memorial Association (MMA) of Honolulu, Hawaii. She was towed from Bremerton on 23 May to Astoria, Oregon, where she sat in fresh water at the mouth of the Columbia River to kill and drop the saltwater barnacles and sea grasses that had grown on her hull in Bremerton,[33] then towed across the eastern Pacific, and docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 22 June, just 500?yd (460?m) from the Arizona Memorial.[26] Less than a year later, on 29 January 1999, Missouri was opened as a museum operated by the MMA.\\r\\nOriginally, the decision to move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance. The National Park Service expressed concern that the battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship Arizona, whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor.[39] To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouri's aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouri's bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizona's hull may rest in peace.[40]\\r\\nMissouri was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 14 May 1971 for hosting the signing of the instrument of Japanese surrender that ended World War II.[39] She is not eligible for designation as a National Historic Landmark because she was extensively modernized in the years following the surrender.[40]\\r\\nOn 14 October 2009, Missouri was moved from her berthing station on Battleship Row to a drydock at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard to undergo a three-month overhaul. The work, priced at $18 million, included installing a new anti-corrosion system, repainting the hull, and upgrading the internal mechanisms. Drydock workers reported that the ship was leaking at some points on the starboard side.[41] The repairs were completed the first week of January 2010 and the ship was returned to her berthing station on Battleship Row on 7 January 2010. The ship's grand reopening occurred on 30 January.[42]\\r\\nMissouri was central to the plot of the film Under Siege, and the ship was prominently featured in another movie, Battleship. As Missouri has not moved under her own power since 1992, shots of the ship at sea were obtained with the help of three tugboats.[43] The music video for Cher's If I Could Turn Back Time was also filmed aboard the Missouri. The U.S. Navy, which had granted permission to shoot the video there, was unhappy with the sexual nature of the performance. [44]\\r\\nMissouri received eight battle stars for her service in World War II, five for her service during the Korean War, and three for her service during the Gulf War.[40] Missouri also received numerous awards for her service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf.[45]","input":"What wars did the uss missouri fight in?"},{"output":"Mark Zuckerberg,","context":"The Social Network is a 2010 American biographical drama film directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal, the film portrays the founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits. It stars Jesse Eisenberg as founder Mark Zuckerberg, along with Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, and Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Neither Zuckerberg nor any other Facebook staff were involved with the project, although Saverin was a consultant for Mezrich's book.[3] The film was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on October 1, 2010.\\r\\nThe Social Network received widespread acclaim, with critics praising its direction, screenplay, acting, editing and score. Although several people portrayed in the film criticized its inaccuracies, the film appeared on 78 critics' Top 10 lists for 2010; of those critics, 22 had the film in their number-one spot, the most of any film in its year. The film was chosen by National Board of Review as the best film of 2010 while Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said \\"The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade.\\" It was also critic Roger Ebert's selection for the best film of the year.\\r\\nAt the 83rd Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Director for Fincher, and Best Actor for Eisenberg, and won three; Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing. The film also received awards for Best Motion Picture ÿ Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2003, 19-year-old Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his LiveJournal blog and then creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection, a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.\\r\\nAfter agreeing to work on the Winklevoss twins' concept, Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for what he calls Thefacebook, an online social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Mark to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them deliberately in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook website itself.\\r\\nSaverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \\"Facebook me\\", a phrase which impresses both of them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who presents a \\"billion dollar\\" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests dropping \\"The\\" from Thefacebook, just calling it Facebook. At Parker's suggestion, the company moves to Palo Alto, with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.\\r\\nWhile competing in the Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub, the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Oxford, Cambridge and LSE, and decide to sue the company for theft of intellectual property. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He later relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel. However, Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg for all the company's shares before being ejected from the building. Subsequently, Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. Later, a cocaine possession incident involving Parker and his attempt to place the blame on Saverin finally convinces Zuckerberg to cut ties with him.\\r\\nThroughout the film, the narrative is intercut with scenes from depositions taken in the Winklevoss twins' and Saverin's respective lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook. The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then refreshing the webpage every few seconds as he waits for her response.\\r\\nThe epilogue states that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of $65?million, signed a non-disclosure agreement, and rowed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, placing sixth; Eduardo Saverin received a settlement of an unknown amount and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead as a co-founder; the website has over 500?million members in 207 countries and is valued at $25?billion; and Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest self-made billionaire.\\r\\nScreenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, \\"What attracted me to [the film project] had nothing to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that Ben Mezrich had written for his publisher for a book he was going to call The Accidental Billionaires. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now. They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines.\\"[8]\\r\\nHowever, according to Sorkin, Mezrich did not send him material from his book as he wrote it: \\"Two or three times we'd get together. I'd go to Boston, or we'd meet in New York and kind of compare notes and share information, but I didn't see the book until he was done with it. By the time I saw the book, I was probably 80 percent done with the screenplay.\\"[8] Sorkin elaborated:\\r\\nCasting began in early August 2009, with open auditions held in various states. Jesse Eisenberg was first announced to be attached to the project in September 2009.[9] (Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast.[10] Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film.[10] In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, \\"Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you never have to worry about the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway ÿ it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie\\".[11]\\r\\nPrincipal photography began in October 2009 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[12] Scenes were filmed around the campuses of two Massachusetts prep schools, Phillips Academy and Milton Academy.[13] Additional scenes were filmed on the campus of Wheelock College, which was set up to be Harvard's campus.[14] (Harvard has turned down most requests for on-location filming ever since the filming of Love Story (1970), which caused significant physical damage to the campus.)[15] Filming took place on the Keyser and Wyman quadrangles in the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University from November 2ÿ4,[16] which also doubled for Harvard in the film.[17] The first scene in the film, where Zuckerberg is with his girlfriend, took 99 takes to finish.[3] The film was shot on the Red One digital cinema camera.[18] The rowing scenes with the Winklevoss brothers were filmed at Community Rowing Inc. in Newton, Massachusetts[19] and at the Henley Royal Regatta.[20] Although a significant portion of the latter half of the film is set in Silicon Valley, the filmmakers opted to shoot those scenes in Los Angeles and Pasadena. Miniature faking process was used in a sequence showing a rowing event at the Henley Royal Regatta.\\r\\nArmie Hammer, who portrayed the Winklevoss twins, acted alongside body double Josh Pence while his scenes were filmed. His face was later digitally grafted onto Pence's face during post-production, while other scenes used split-screen photography. Pence was concerned about having no face time during the role, but after consideration thought of the role as a \\"no-brainer\\". He also appears in a cameo role elsewhere in the film.[21] Hammer states that director David Fincher \\"likes to push himself and likes to push technology\\" and is \\"one of the most technologically minded guys I've ever seen.\\"[22] This included sending the actors to \\"twin boot camp\\" for 10 months to learn everything about the Winklevosses.[21]\\r\\nCommunity Rowing Inc. held a casting call and a tryout for 20 rowing extras; some were graduates from Harvard, Northeastern University, Boston University, George Washington University, and Trinity College, as well as local club rowers from Union Boat Club and Riverside Boat Club.[23] None of the cast rowing extras for the Henley Royal Regatta racing scene appeared in the film; filming for the race was originally planned to take place in Los Angeles, but Fincher decided to film in New England during production.[24]\\r\\nDavid Fincher hired Loyola Marymount coach Dawn Reagan to help train Josh Pence and Armie Hammer.[25] While Hammer was new to the sport, Pence rowed previously at Dartmouth College.[25]\\r\\nThe indoor rowing scene was filmed at Boston University's indoor rowing tanks. All of BU's blue oars in the scene were repainted to Harvard's crimson color for filming. Dan Boyne was the official rowing consultant for the film both in the US and the UK.[24]\\r\\nOn June 1, 2010, it was announced that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would score the film.[26] The soundtrack was released September 28 in various formats under the Null Corporation label.[27] Leading up to the release of the soundtrack, a free five-track EP was made available for download.[28] The White Stripes' song \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" can be heard in the opening of the film and The Beatles' song \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\" concludes the film. Neither song appears on the soundtrack.\\r\\nReznor and Ross won the award for Best Original Score at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards,[29] as well as the 2011 Academy Award for Best Original Score.\\r\\nThe first theatrical poster was released on June 18, 2010.[30] The film's first teaser trailer was released on June 25, 2010.[31] The second teaser was released on July 8.[32] The full length theatrical trailer debuted on July 16, 2010, which plays an edited version of the song \\"Creep\\", originally by Radiohead, covered by the Belgian choir group Scala & Kolacny Brothers.[33][34] The trailer was then shown in theaters, prior to the films Inception, Dinner for Schmucks, Salt, Easy A, The Virginity Hit, and The Other Guys. The theatrical trailer, put together by Mark Woollen & Associates, won the Grand Key Art award at the 2011 Key Art Awards,[35] sponsored by The Hollywood Reporter, and was also featured on The Film Informant's Perfect 10 Trailers in 2010.[36]\\r\\nThe Social Network was released on DVD and Blu-ray January 11, 2011. In its first week of release, DVD sales totaled $13,470,305 and it was the number one sold DVD of the week.[37] The DVD includes an audio commentary with director David Fincher, and a second commentary with writer Aaron Sorkin and the cast. The Blu-ray and 2-Disc DVD releases include the commentaries, along with a feature length documentary, How Did They Ever Make a Movie of Facebook?, featurettes, Angus Wall, Kirk Baxter and Ren Klyce on Post, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and David Fincher on the Score, In the Hall of the Mountain King: Reznor's First Draft, Swarmatron, Jeff Cronenweth and David Fincher on the Visuals, and a Ruby Skye VIP Room: Multi-Angle Scene Breakdown feature.[38]\\r\\nDuring its opening weekend in the United States, the film debuted at No. 1, grossing $22.4 million in 2,771 theaters.[2] The film retained the top spot in its second weekend, dropping only 31.2%,[2] breaking Inception's 32.0% record as the smallest second weekend drop for any number-one film of 2010, while being the third-smallest overall behind Secretariat's 25.1% drop and Tooth Fairy's 28.6% drop. At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $97 million in the United States and $128 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $224.9 million.[2]\\r\\nOn review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 292 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Impeccably scripted, beautifully directed, and filled with fine performances, The Social Network is a riveting, ambitious example of modern filmmaking at its finest.\\"[39] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 95 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\" and making it one of the site's highest rated movies of all-time.[40] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale.[41]\\r\\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, giving it four stars and naming it the best film of the year, wrote: \\"David Fincher's film has the rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero, but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive.\\"[42] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film his first full four-star rating of the year and said: \\"The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade.\\"[43] The Harvard Crimson review called it \\"flawless\\" and gave it five stars.[44] Quentin Tarantino listed The Social Network as one of his favorite 20 movies of the year, second to Toy Story 3.[45]\\r\\nSome reviewers pointed out that the film plays loosely, however, with the facts behind Facebook's founding. Joe Morgenstern in The Wall Street Journal praised the film as exhilarating but noted: \\"The biographical part takes liberties with its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on a contentious book, Ben Mezrich's The Accidental Billionaires, so everything that's seen isn't necessarily to be believed.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe film won Best Picture from the National Board of Review, National Society of Film Critics, New York Film Critics Circle, and Los Angeles Film Critics Association, making it only the third film in history ÿ after Schindler's List (1993) and L.A. Confidential (1997) ÿ to sweep the \\"Big Four\\" critics awards.[47] The film also won the \\"Hollywood Ensemble Award\\" from the Hollywood Film Awards.[48][49] The Social Network appeared on 78 critics' top 10 lists for 2010, of those critics 22 had the film in their number one spot.[50]\\r\\nIn August 2016, The Social Network was voted the 27th best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as voted on by 177 film critics from around the world.[51]\\r\\nThe Social Network appeared on over 70 critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2010. Over a dozen publications ranked the film first in their lists, including the British film magazine Sight & Sound.[52][53]\\r\\nThe Social Network won the Best Motion Picture ÿ Drama Golden Globe at the 68th Golden Globe Awards on January 16, 2011.[54] The film also won the awards for Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score, making it the film with the most wins of the night.[55]\\r\\nThe film was nominated for seven British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Jesse Eisenberg), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Andrew Garfield), and Rising Star Award (Andrew Garfield). It won three for Best Editing, Adapted Screenplay, and Best Direction on February 13, 2011.[56]\\r\\nThe Social Network received nominations for eight Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Adapted Screenplay.[57] It won three for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards on February 27, 2011.\\r\\nThe script was leaked online in July 2009.[58][59] In November 2009, executive producer Kevin Spacey said, \\"The Social Network is probably going to be a lot funnier than people might expect it to be.\\"[60] The Cardinal Courier stated that the film was about \\"greed, obsession, unpredictability and sex\\" and asked \\"although there are over 500 million Facebook users, does this mean Facebook can become a profitable blockbuster movie?\\"[61]\\r\\nAt the D8 conference hosted by D: All Things Digital on June 2, 2010, host Kara Swisher told Zuckerberg she knew he was not happy with The Social Network being based on him, to which he replied, \\"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\\"[62] Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying of the film is mostly fiction, explaining \\"this is my life, so I know it's not so dramatic,\\" and that he spent most of the past six years focusing, working hard, and coding Facebook.[63] Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg stated that the film portrayed his motivations for creating Facebook inaccurately; instead of an effort to \\"get girls\\", he says he created the site because he enjoys \\"building things\\".[64] However, he added that the film accurately depicted his real-life wardrobe, saying, \\"It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right ÿ like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own.\\"[64]\\r\\nFacebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz called the film a \\"dramatization of history ... it is interesting to see my past rewritten in a way that emphasizes things that didn't matter, (like the Winklevosses, who I've still never even met and had no part in the work we did to create the site over the past 6 years) and leaves out things that really did (like the many other people in our lives at the time, who supported us in innumerable ways)\\".[65] According to Moskovitz:\\r\\nCo-founder Eduardo Saverin said of the film, \\"[...] the movie was clearly intended to be entertainment and not a fact-based documentary.\\"[67]\\r\\nSorkin has stated that \\"I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling. What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\\"[68]\\r\\nJournalist Jeff Jarvis acknowledged the film was \\"well-crafted\\" but called it \\"the anti-social movie\\", objecting to Sorkin's decision to change various events and characters for dramatic effect, and dismissing it as \\"the story that those who resist the change society is undergoing want to see.\\"[69] Technology broadcaster Leo Laporte concurred, calling the film \\"anti-geek and misogynistic\\".[70] Sorkin responded to these allegations by saying, \\"I was writing about a very angry and deeply misogynistic group of people\\".[71]\\r\\nAndrew Clark of The Guardian wrote that \\"there's something insidious about this genre of [docudrama] scriptwriting,\\" wondering if \\"a 26-year-old businessman really deserves to have his name dragged through the mud in a murky mixture of fact and imagination for the general entertainment of the movie-viewing public?\\" Clark added, \\"I'm not sure whether Mark Zuckerberg is a punk, a genius or both. But I won't be seeing The Social Network to find out.\\"[72]\\r\\nSeveral noteworthy tech journalists and bloggers voiced their opinions of how the film portrays its real-life characters. Mashable founder and CEO Pete Cashmore, blogging for CNN, said: \\"If the Facebook founder [Zuckerberg] is concerned about being represented as anything but a genius with an industrious work ethic, he can breathe a sigh of relief.\\"[73] Jessi Hempel, a technology writer for Fortune who says she's known Zuckerberg \\"for a long time\\", wrote of the film:\\r\\nHarvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig wrote in The New Republic that Sorkin's screenplay does not acknowledge the \\"real villain\\" of the story:\\r\\nIn an onstage discussion with The Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington, during Advertising Week 2010 in New York, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said she had seen the film and it was \\"very Hollywood\\" and mainly \\"fiction\\". \\"In real life, he [Zuckerberg] was just sitting around with his friends in front of his computer, ordering pizza,\\" she declared. \\"Who wants to go see that for two hours?\\"[76]\\r\\nDivya Narendra said that he was \\"initially surprised\\" to see himself portrayed by the non-Indian actor Max Minghella, but also admitted that the actor did a \\"good job in pushing the dialogue forward and creating a sense of urgency in what was a very frustrating period.\\"[77]\\r\\nSince its release, The Social Network has been cited as inspiring involvement in start-ups and social media.[78] Bob Lefsetz has stated that: watching this movie makes you want to run from the theatre, grab your laptop and build your own empire,[79] noting that The Social Network has helped fuel an emerging perception that techies have become the new rock stars.[80] This has led Dave Knox to comment that: fifteen years from now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of entrepreneurs.[79] After seeing the movie, Zuckerberg was quoted as saying he is \\"interested to see what effect The Social Network has on entrepreneurship\\", noting that he gets \\"lots of messages from people who claim that they have been very much inspired... to start their own company.\\"[81] Saverin echoed these sentiments, stating that the film may inspire \\"countless others to create and take that leap to start a new business.\\"[82] In one such instance, the co-founders of Wall Street Magnate confirmed that they were inspired to create the fantasy trading community after watching The Social Network.[83]\\r\\nFollowing his success with the film, Sorkin became attached to another project about a technology company, writing the script for the 2015 biopic Steve Jobs, which used a similar format.[84] Another Facebook film may be produced, as the company's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, has signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to develop her new book Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, into a movie.[85]","input":"Who is the protagonist in the social network?"},{"output":"at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec, Canada","context":"On March 3, 1875, the first recorded indoor ice hockey game took place at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.[1] Organized by James Creighton, who captained one of the teams, the game was between two nine-member teams, using a wooden 'puck'. Members used skates and sticks used for outdoor hockey and shinny games in Nova Scotia, where Creighton was born and raised. It is recognized as the first organized ice hockey game.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Victoria Skating Rink was a long (252 by 113 feet (77?m G?34?m)), two-story brick edifice with a 52-foot (16?m)-high pitched roof supported from within by curving wooden trusses, which arched over the entire width of the structure. Tall, round-arched windows punctuated its length and illuminated its interior, while evening skating was made possible by 500?gas-jet lighting fixtures set in coloured glass globes.[3] At a later date, the lighting was converted to electric, making the building the first in Canada to be electrified.[4]\\r\\nThe ice surface measured 204 by 80 feet (62 by 24?m), dimensions very similar to today's National Hockey League (NHL) ice rinks. It was surrounded by a 10-foot (3.0?m)-wide platform, or promenade, which was elevated approximately 1 foot (30?cm) above the ice surface and upon which spectators could stand or skaters could rest.[1] Later, a gallery was added with a royal box for visiting dignitaries.[5]\\r\\nAt the time of its construction, the rink's location at 49 Drummond Street (now renumbered to 1187) placed it in the centre of the English community in Montreal, in the vicinity of McGill University. The area is known today as the \\"Square Mile\\", the area of central Montreal populated then by rich English industrialists and the budding centre of commerce in Canada.[6] One block east was Dominion Square, where annual outdoor winter sporting events and later the Montreal Winter Carnival were held. Across the street to the east, the Windsor Hotel, a long-time centre of social life and meeting place of several sports organizations, was built in 1875. Nearby is old Windsor Station, which was the eastern terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, built in 1889.\\r\\nIn 1873, James Creighton, a member of the Victoria Skating Club and a figure skating judge, started organizing sessions of shinny at the rink, played informally between members of the Club and friends. The rules followed were developed from the informal rules of the outdoor game played in Nova Scotia where Creighton was born and raised, and adapted to the indoors setting and the rink's size.[7]\\r\\nOn March 3, 1875, the Rink hosted what has been recognized as the first organized ice hockey game,[2] between members of the Victoria Skating Club, organized by Creighton.[8] The match lays claim to this distinction because of factors which establish its link to modern ice hockey: it featured two teams (nine players per side) with a recorded score. Games prior to this had mostly been outdoors. In order to limit injuries to spectators and damage to glass windows, the game was played with a \\"flat block of wood\\" instead of a lacrosse ball. The two teams, members of the club, included a number of McGill University students. Sticks for this game were imported from Nova Scotia.[9] This first game was pre-announced to the general public in the pages of The Montreal Gazette:\\r\\nThe nine-man per side practice would last until 1880, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments.\\r\\nNot reported in the Gazette, but reported elsewhere was that there was fighting after the game. This fighting was not between the on-ice combatants, rather, it was between the hockey players and spectators and members of the Skating Club. Members of the Skating Club were opposed to the use of the skating rink for hockey as it took away hours from other skating activities and it damaged the ice quality. According to the Kingston, Ontario, Daily British Whig \\"Shins and heads were battered, benches smashed and the lady spectators fled in confusion.\\"[12][13]\\r\\nIn 2002, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) announced that it would acknowledge the site of Victoria Rink with \\"a commemorative plaque or other historical site marker to remind the passers-by of the existence of the Victoria Skating Rink, the birthplace of organized hockey.\\"[14] The commemoration has been marked in two ways. On May 22, 2008, a commemorative plaque was dedicated at the nearby Centre Bell, along with a plaque honouring James Creighton.[8] Further, the IIHF created the Victoria Cup, a trophy named for the arena, for whichalong with 1 million Swiss francsone National Hockey League team and the champion of the European Champions Hockey League play off annually.[15] The first Cup match was held in Berne, Switzerland on October 1, 2008 between the New York Rangers and the Metallurg Magnitogorsk.[16] The next, and last, edition of the Victoria Cup was held in Zurich on September 29, 2009, between the ZSC Lions and the Chicago Blackhawks.\\r\\nCoordinates: 452953N 733421W? / ?45.4980N 73.572400W? / 45.4980; -73.572400","input":"Where was the first ice hockey game played?"},{"output":"consist of more than one cell","context":"Multicellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to unicellular organisms.[1]\\r\\nAll species of animals, land plants and most fungi are multicellular, as are many algae, whereas a few organisms are partially uni- and partially multicellular, like slime molds and social amoebae such as the genus Dictyostelium.\\r\\nMulticellular organisms arise in various ways, for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells.[2] Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, because the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed \\"pluricellular\\" rather than \\"multicellular\\".[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMulticellularity has evolved independently at least 46 times in eukaryotes,[5][6] and also in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and land plants.[7] It evolved repeatedly for Chloroplastida (green algae and land plants), once or twice for animals, once for brown algae, three times in the fungi (chytrids, ascomycetes and basidiomycetes)[8] and perhaps several times for slime molds and red algae.[9] The first evidence of multicellularity is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived 3ÿ3.5 billion years ago.[5] To reproduce, true multicellular organisms must solve the problem of regenerating a whole organism from germ cells (i.e. sperm and egg cells), an issue that is studied in evolutionary developmental biology. Animals have evolved a considerable diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100ÿ150 different cell types), compared with 10ÿ20 in plants and fungi.[10]\\r\\nLoss of multicellularity occurred in some groups.[11] Fungi are predominantly multicellular, though early diverging lineages are largely unicellular (e.g. Microsporidia) and there have been numerous reversions to unicellularity across fungi (e.g. Saccharomycotina, Cryptococcus, and other yeasts).[12][13] It may also have occurred in some red algae (e.g. Porphyridium), but it is possible that they are primitively unicellular.[14] Loss of multicellularity is also considered probable in some green algae (e.g. Chlorella vulgaris and some Ulvophyceae).[15][16] In other groups, generally parasites, a reduction of multicellularity occurred, in number or types of cells (e.g. the myxozoans, multicellular organisms, earlier thought to be unicellular, are probably extremely reduced cnidarians).[17]\\r\\nMulticellular organisms, especially long-living animals, face the challenge of cancer, which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth within the normal program of development. Changes in tissue morphology can be observed during this process. Cancer in animals (metazoans) has often been described as a loss of multicellularity.[18] There is a discussion about the possibility of existence of cancer in other multicellular organisms[19][20] or even in protozoa.[21] For example, plant galls have been characterized as tumors[22] but some authors argue that plants do not develop cancer.[23]\\r\\nIn some multicellular groups, which are called Weismannists, a separation between a sterile somatic cell line and a germ cell line evolved. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g. vertebrates, arthropods, Volvox), as great part of species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g. land plants, most algae, many invertebrates).[24][25]\\r\\nOne hypothesis for the origin of multicellularity is that a group of function-specific cells aggregated into a slug-like mass called a grex, which moved as a multicellular unit. This is essentially what slime molds do. Another hypothesis is that a primitive cell underwent nucleus division, thereby becoming a coenocyte. A membrane would then form around each nucleus (and the cellular space and organelles occupied in the space), thereby resulting in a group of connected cells in one organism (this mechanism is observable in Drosophila). A third hypothesis is that as a unicellular organism divided, the daughter cells failed to separate, resulting in a conglomeration of identical cells in one organism, which could later develop specialized tissues. This is what plant and animal embryos do as well as colonial choanoflagellates.[26][27]\\r\\nBecause the first multicellular organisms were simple, soft organisms lacking bone, shell or other hard body parts, they are not well preserved in the fossil record.[28] One exception may be the demosponge, which may have left a chemical signature in ancient rocks. The earliest fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested Grypania spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil B Formation in Gabon (Gabonionta).[29] The Doushantuo Formation has yielded 600 million year old microfossils with evidence of multicellular traits.[30]\\r\\nUntil recently, phylogenetic reconstruction has been through anatomical (particularly embryological) similarities. This is inexact, as living multicellular organisms such as animals and plants are more than 500 million years removed from their single-cell ancestors. Such a passage of time allows both divergent and convergent evolution time to mimic similarities and accumulate differences between groups of modern and extinct ancestral species. Modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques such as alloenzymes, satellite DNA and other molecular markers to describe traits that are shared between distantly related lineages.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe evolution of multicellularity could have occurred in a number of different ways, some of which are described below:\\r\\nThis theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from symbiosis (cooperation) of different species of single-cell organisms, each with different roles. Over time these organisms would become so dependent on each other they would not be able to survive independently, eventually leading to the incorporation of their genomes into one multicellular organism.[31] Each respective organism would become a separate lineage of differentiated cells within the newly created species.\\r\\nThis kind of severely co-dependent symbiosis can be seen frequently, such as in the relationship between clown fish and Riterri sea anemones. In these cases, it is extremely doubtful whether either species would survive very long if the other became extinct. However, the problem with this theory is that it is still not known how each organism's DNA could be incorporated into one single genome to constitute them as a single species. Although such symbiosis is theorized to have occurred (e.g. mitochondria and chloroplasts in animal and plant cellsendosymbiosis), it has happened only extremely rarely and, even then, the genomes of the endosymbionts have retained an element of distinction, separately replicating their DNA during mitosis of the host species. For instance, the two or three symbiotic organisms forming the composite lichen, although dependent on each other for survival, have to separately reproduce and then re-form to create one individual organism once more.\\r\\nThis theory states that a single unicellular organism, with multiple nuclei, could have developed internal membrane partitions around each of its nuclei.[32] Many protists such as the ciliates or slime molds can have several nuclei, lending support to this hypothesis. However, the simple presence of multiple nuclei is not enough to support the theory. Multiple nuclei of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions. The macronucleus serves the organism's needs, whereas the micronucleus is used for sexual reproduction with exchange of genetic material. Slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid cells, like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms, not the other way round. To be deemed valid, this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium.\\r\\nThe Colonial Theory of Haeckel, 1874, proposes that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the symbiotic theory, which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism. At least some, it is presumed land-evolved, multicellularity occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g. cellular slime molds) whereas for the majority of multicellular types (those that evolved within aquatic environments), multicellularity occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division.[33] The mechanism of this latter colony formation can be as simple as incomplete cytokinesis, though multicellularity is also typically considered to involve cellular differentiation.[34]\\r\\nThe advantage of the Colonial Theory hypothesis is that it has been seen to occur independently in 16 different protoctistan phyla. For instance, during food shortages the amoeba Dictyostelium groups together in a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoeba then slightly differentiate from each other. Other examples of colonial organisation in protista are Volvocaceae, such as Eudorina and Volvox, the latter of which consists of up to 500ÿ50,000 cells (depending on the species), only a fraction of which reproduce.[35] For example, in one species 25ÿ35 cells reproduce, 8 asexually and around 15ÿ25 sexually. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, as the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed \\"pluricellular\\" rather than \\"multicellular\\".[3]\\r\\nSome authors suggest that the origin of multicellularity, at least in Metazoa, occurred due to a transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation, rather than through a gradual evolution of cell differentiation, as affirmed in Haeckels Gastraea theory.[36]\\r\\nAbout 800 million years ago,[37] a minor genetic change in a single molecule called guanylate kinase protein-interaction domain (GK-PID) may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.[38]\\r\\nGenes borrowed from viruses have recently been identified as playing a crucial role in the differentiation of multicellular tissues and organs and even in sexual reproduction, in the fusion of egg cell and sperm. Such fused cells are also involved in metazoan membranes such as those that prevent chemicals crossing the placenta and the brain body separation. Two viral components have been identified. The first is syncytin, which came from a virus. The second identified in 2007 is called EFF1, which helps form the skin of Caenorhabditis elegans, part of a whole family of FF proteins. Felix Rey, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris has constructed the 3D structure of the EFF1 protein[39] and shown it does the work of linking one cell to another, in viral infections. The fact that all known cell fusion molecules are viral in origin suggests that they have been vitally important to the inter-cellular communication systems that enabled multicellularity. Without the ability of cellular fusion, colonies could have formed, but anything even as complex as a sponge would not have been possible.[40]\\r\\nMulticellularity allows an organism to exceed the size limits normally imposed by diffusion: single cells with increased size have a decreased surface-to-volume ratio and have difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients and transporting them throughout the cell. Multicellular organisms thus have the competitive advantages of an increase in size without its limitations. They can have longer lifespans as they can continue living when individual cells die. Multicellularity also permits increasing complexity by allowing differentiation of cell types within one organism.","input":"What does it mean to be multi cellular?"},{"output":"7,221","context":"The 2017 World Series of Poker was the 48th annual World Series of Poker (WSOP).

It is also the county seat of Pulaski County. It was incorporated on November 7, 1831, on the south bank of the Arkansas River close to the state's geographic center. The city derives its name from a rock formation along the river, named \\"la petite roche\\" by the French explorer Jean-Baptiste Bnard de la Harpe in the 1720s. The capital of the Arkansas Territory was moved to Little Rock from Arkansas Post in 1821. The city's population was 193,524 at the 2010 census. The six county Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is ranked 75th in terms of population in the United States with 724,385 residents according to the 2013 estimate by the United States Census Bureau.[2][4]\\r\\nLittle Rock is a cultural, economic, government, and transportation center within Arkansas and the South. Several cultural institutions are in Little Rock, such as the Arkansas Arts Center, the Arkansas Repertory Theatre, and the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra, in addition to the hiking, boating, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. Little Rock's history is available through history museums, historic districts or neighborhoods like the Quapaw Quarter, and historic sites such as Little Rock Central High School. The city is the headquarters of Dillard's, Windstream Communications, Acxiom, Stephens Inc., University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Heifer International, the Clinton Foundation, and the Rose Law Firm. Other large corporations, such as Dassault Falcon Jet and LM Wind Power have large operations in the city. State government is a large employer, with many offices being in downtown Little Rock. Two Interstate highways, Interstate 30 and Interstate 40, meet in Little Rock, with the Port of Little Rock serving as a shipping hub.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Rock derives its name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the Arkansas River called \\"le petit rocher\\" (French: \\"the little rock\\"). The \\"little rock\\" was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing. The \\"little rock\\" is across the river from \\"big rock,\\" a large bluff at the edge of the river, which was once used as a rock quarry.[5]\\r\\nArcheological artifacts provide evidence of Native Americans inhabiting Central Arkansas for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. The early inhabitants may have been the Folsom people, Bluff Dwellers, and Mississippian culture peoples who built earthwork mounds recorded in 1541 by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Historical tribes of the area were the Caddo, Quapaw, Osage, Choctaw, and Cherokee.\\r\\nLittle Rock was named for a stone outcropping on the bank of the Arkansas River used by early travelers as a landmark.[6] Le Petit Rocher (French for \\"the Little Rock\\"), named in 1722 by French explorer and trader Jean-Baptiste Bnard de la Harpe, marked the transition from the flat Mississippi Delta region to the Ouachita Mountain foothills. Travelers referred to the area as \\"the Little Rock.\\" Though there was an effort to officially name the city \\"Arkopolis\\" upon it's founding in the 1820s, and that name did appear on a few maps made by the US Geological Survey, the name Little Rock is eventually what stuck[7][8][9].\\r\\nLittle Rock is located at 344410N 921952W? / ?34.73611N 92.33111W? / 34.73611; -92.33111 (34.736009, ?92.331122).[10]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 116.8 square miles (303?km2), of which, 116.2 square miles (301?km2) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.6?km2) of it (0.52%) is water.\\r\\nLittle Rock is located on the south bank of the Arkansas River in Central Arkansas.

Northwest of the city limits are Pinnacle Mountain and Lake Maumelle, which provides Little Rock's drinking water.\\r\\nThe city of North Little Rock is located just across the river from Little Rock, but it is a separate city. North Little Rock was once the 8th ward of Little Rock. An Arkansas Supreme Court decision on February 6, 1904, allowed the ward to merge with the neighboring town of North Little Rock. The merged town quickly renamed itself Argenta (the local name for the former 8th Ward), but returned to its original name in October 1917.[11]\\r\\nThe 2013 U.S. Census population estimate for the Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR Metropolitan Statistical Area was 724,385.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896.  These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007.

They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980.

It was the seventh Bahrain Grand Prix and the opening round of the 2010 Formula One season. It was the first time since 2006 that Bahrain had hosted the opening round and the race took place on a lengthened layout of the track.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race was won by Fernando Alonso, his first as a Ferrari driver.[3] His new teammate, Felipe Massa ensured a good start to the year for the team by finishing second. McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton completed the podium by finishing in third position.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the race had been led by polesitter and Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel, until lap 33 when a gearbox problem forced him to concede the lead to Alonso. This meant that he was eventually overtaken by Massa and Hamilton too, meaning that he finished in fourth place. Vettel's teammate, Mark Webber qualified sixth before finishing the race in eighth place. Michael Schumacher's first race of his return to Formula One for the Mercedes resulted in him finishing sixth, one place behind teammate Nico Rosberg. Reigning world champion Jenson Button completed his first race for the McLaren team by finishing seventh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three new teams ÿ Lotus, Hispania and Virgin ÿ did not have a very successful debut race. Their six cars occupied the last six places in qualifying, and only one, the Lotus of Heikki Kovalainen, finished the race, although Jarno Trulli's Lotus was also classified in last place. As a consequence of the race, Fernando Alonso and Ferrari led their respective championships with maximum points.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race saw the debut of three new teams: Hispania, Virgin and the new Malaysian-owned Lotus (not a direct descendent to Team Lotus, even though it is part owned by the same company which at present owns Lotus Cars), as well as the return of Mercedes after Daimler AG's take over of Brawn GP after the end of the 2009 season, and of Sauber, having competed as BMW the previous year. New drivers Nico Hlkenberg, Karun Chandhok, Bruno Senna, Lucas di Grassi and Vitaly Petrov also take part in their maiden races. Hlkenberg joined Williams, Petrov joined Renault and di Grassi became part of the Virgin team, while Hispania had an all-rookie line-up of Senna and Chandhok. Petrov became Russia's first ever Formula One World Championship driver; Chandhok became India's second following Narain Karthikeyan; Senna is a nephew of the legendary three-time Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna.\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 World Drivers' Champion Jenson Button made his debut for McLaren after changing teams from 2009 Constructors' Champion team Brawn in November 2009. Seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher made his return to Formula One with Mercedes, Felipe Massa returned for Ferrari after his head injury at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, and Timo Glock returned with the Virgin team following his accident at the 2009 Japanese Grand Prix.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the previous winners of the event were present: Jenson Button won the 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix, with the Ferrari pair of Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa were both two-time winners at this circuit. Schumacher won the first event in 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race also saw a return to the banning of refueling of the cars during the race, a practice which had been allowed since the 1994 Formula One season. Additionally a new points scoring system to decide the World Drivers' Championship was implemented, the most radical revamp of the system since the formation of the World Championship in 1950. Race winning drivers will now score more than double the number of points previously allocated with points distributed further down the list of finishers. The proportions of points available to winners are higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 24 drivers, this was the largest grid at a Grand Prix since 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race was also the first to feature a revised stewards' panel under new FIA regulations, featuring a former Formula One driver.  The driver in Bahrain was four-time World Champion Alain Prost.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdrian Sutil set the fastest time for the Force India team in the first session of free practice on Friday morning. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) was second, ahead of Robert Kubica (Renault), Felipe Massa in the other Ferrari, and the two McLaren drivers, Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton. On his return to Formula One, Michael Schumacher set the tenth-fastest time for Mercedes, two positions behind teammate Nico Rosberg. Of the new teams, both Lotus drivers and Timo Glock set times, but Lucas di Grassi did not complete a full lap in the second Virgin car. The Hispania team was still completing its two chassis when the session started, but Bruno Senna was able to complete two installation laps before it ended.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn session 2 of free practice, Nico Rosberg set the fastest time, with Hamilton in second and Schumacher came third. Senna was struggling to match the pace of the fastest GP2 Asia Series drivers, but eventually did so, four seconds off the pace of the Virgins.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Saturday free practice session, Alonso in the Ferrari set the fastest time of 1:54.099, 0.269?seconds faster than Nico Rosberg in the Mercedes. Hispania's Karun Chandhok failed to participate in the practice session due to a hydraulic problem.[6] Elsewhere, the Virgin of Glock lost its left-front wheel in the middle of the session, with the problem being attributed to an under-torqued airgun.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first qualifying session saw the six drivers from the three new teams eliminated, with Timo Glock ÿ the fastest of the newcomers ÿ 2.7?seconds adrift of Jaime Alguersuari in eighteenth and the only driver from the established teams to be eliminated. Despite a crippling hydraulics problem that saw him unable to take part in any of the free practice sessions, Hispania's Karun Chandhok was able to qualify in 24th and last place with a lap time ten seconds slower than the fastest driver, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso.\\r\\n\\r\\nReigning World Champion Jenson Button narrowly avoided elimination in the second qualifying period, pushing former Brawn GP teammate Rubens Barrichello out of the top ten and into elimination. Barrichello's Williams teammate Nico Hlkenberg was also eliminated, as were both Saubers of Pedro de la Rosa and Kamui Kobayashi, the second Toro Rosso of Sbastien Buemi, Force India's Vitantonio Liuzzi and rookie driver Vitaly Petrov in the Renault.\\r\\n\\r\\nRed Bull's Sebastian Vettel took pole late in the third session, edging out the Ferraris of Massa and Alonso, with 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton in fourth. Mercedes's Nico Rosberg and seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher were fifth and seventh respectively, with Sebastian Vettel's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber splitting them. Jenson Button could only manage eighth place, while ninth and tenth were taken by Robert Kubica and Adrian Sutil in the remaining Renault and Force India.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first corner of the first lap saw Mark Webber's engine release copious amounts of oil smoke, triggering a sequence of events that saw Adrian Sutil and Robert Kubica spin around and fall to the back of the field. The first lap was otherwise clean, with Sebastian Vettel quickly converting his pole position into the race lead. Fernando Alonso got past teammate Felipe Massa, to get second, and both Mercedes drivers also gained a place, with Nico Rosberg fourth ahead of Lewis Hamilton, and Michael Schumacher beating Mark Webber to sixth spot. There was little position-changing otherwise, with Vitaly Petrov in the second Renault the biggest mover, up to eleventh from seventeenth on the grid.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a race of attrition, with the first major incident of the race being the retirement of Hispania's Karun Chandhok, who, after just a handful of laps in qualifying, hit a bump he did not know existed and retired with a damaged front wing. Virgin Racing's Lucas di Grassi joined him on the sidelines shortly thereafter when his Virgin VR-01's hydraulics  a chronic problem throughout the off-season  gave up. Fellow rookie Nico Hlkenberg was lucky to avoid a similar fate to Chandhok when he missed a corner on the run down to turn seventeen and skipped over the circuit. Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi fell victim to hydraulic failure, and was joined a lap later by Petrov who damaged his front-right suspension when he hit a kerb too hard; at the time of his retirement, Petrov had been the highest-placed rookie and had been racing Rubens Barrichello for tenth place and the final championship point on offer. Renault later clarified the issue as being an unanticipated mechanical fault on both cars that was traced back to Petrov's preference for a lower ride height than teammate Kubica who went unscathed. Timo Glock in the second Virgin also retired after losing third and fifth gears, while Bruno Senna's debut for Hispania ended when his engine overheated at the end of the main straight. The six drivers retired during the first seventeen laps. At the front, Vettel and the two Ferraris quickly pulled out a sizeable gap to the rest of the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first round of pit stops also proved to be the only round of stops, with Vettel stretching out enough of a lead to prevent the Ferraris from leap-frogging them. Elsewhere, good work from the McLaren crew allowed both their drivers to gain a place in the stops; Hamilton on Rosberg, and Jenson Button on Webber. The list of retirements grew on lap 23 when Pedro de la Rosa in the second BMW Sauber was also struck by a hydraulic issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nVettel continued to lead comfortably, two seconds ahead of Alonso and a further three ahead of Massa. However, he began to notieceably slow down during the latter part of the race due to a problem that was later identified within the team as a problem with a spark plug, and was quickly passed by the two Ferraris and Hamilton, and spent the rest of the race trying to hold Rosberg at bay. Alonso went on to win the race, joining Juan Manuel Fangio, Giancarlo Baghetti, Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell and Kimi R?ikk?nen as the only men to win for Ferrari on their debut. Massa finished second on his return to full-time racing after his injury at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Hamilton completed the podium, while Vettel successfully fended Rosberg off long enough to salvage fourth. Schumacher followed his teammate home for sixth, with Button seventh, Webber eighth, Vitantonio Liuzzi placing ninth and Barrichello claiming the final point on offer. Kubica recovered from his first-corner spin to claim eleventh while Sbastien Buemi and Jarno Trulli also retired; Buemi's Toro Rosso was struck by electrical issues, while Trulli added his name to the growing list of drivers taken down by hydraulics issues. As they each retired having completed 46 laps, they were classified as finishers as they completed ninety percent of the winner's race distance. Heikki Kovalainen finished fifteenth in the second Lotus, meaning that Lotus became the only entrant of the new teams to have a car finish the race.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was criticism after the race of the \\"new\\" Formula One, with it being echoed by Formula One personalities. McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh stated that the F1 community had to \\"work together to improve it.\\"[9] Former driver and BBC pundit David Coulthard said that two pitstops could be made mandatory as it \\"would also mean more potential for mistakes (and, by extension, spectator interest) in the pits.\\" Coulthard was critical also of changes made by former FIA president Max Mosley, as the changes were made during his time in charge.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne person to disagree with the criticism, though, was Alain Prost, who said that \\"after a few races, I am sure the good drivers, the top drivers, will like it [the new format].\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new section of the circuit used by Formula One for the first time also drew criticism from both drivers and fans alike, with most claiming the added corners offered little in the way of passing opportunities. For the next Bahrain Grand Prix in 2012, Formula One would revert to using the original Grand Prix Circuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes:","input":"Who won the 2010 bahrain f1 grand prix?"},{"output":"near Rockport, Texas","context":"Hurricane Harvey was an extremely destructive Atlantic hurricane which became the first major hurricane[nb 1] to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005, ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity in the country. In a four-day period, many areas received more than 40 inches (100?cm) of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic flooding. With peak accumulations of 64.58?in (164.0?cm), Harvey is the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaced more than 30,000?people, and prompted more than 17,000?rescues.\\r\\nThe eighth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles, reaching tropical storm status on August?17. The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day, passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August?19. The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucatn Peninsula, before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August?23. Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August?24, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day. While the storm moved generally northwest, Harvey's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August?24ÿ25; however, Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category?4 intensity later that day. Hours later, Harvey made landfall near Rockport, Texas, at peak intensity. Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued, and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state, dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state. On August 28, it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29. As Harvey drifted inland, it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1, before dissipating two days later.\\r\\nHarvey caused at least 77 confirmed deaths: 1 in Guyana,[1] and 76 in the United States.[2][3][4] Economic losses are preliminarily estimated at between $70[5] to $200 billion,[6] with a large portion of the losses sustained by uninsured homeowners.\\r\\nAt the beginning of August?13, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave on the western coast of Africa. Amid favorable environmental conditions, the wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure southwest of Cape Verde and gradually organize thereafter.[7] Instead, the two disturbances remained separate, with the broad trough continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north.[8] On August?17, shower and thunderstorm activity in association with the trough began to show signs of organization,[9] while high-resolution satellite showed an increasingly defined low-level circulation.[10] As such, the NHC initiated advisories on a potential tropical cyclone, allowing tropical storm watches and warnings to be hoisted for portions of the Lesser Antilles.[11] An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft deployed to the disturbance later that afternoon found a well-defined center and tropical storm-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Harvey at 21:00?UTC.[12]\\r\\nFollowing its designation, the cyclone moved swiftly westward into the Caribbean Sea under the influence of an expansive ridge of high pressure to its north. An environment of moderate wind shear complicated the weather of the storm's intensity, with global forecast models suggesting dissipation in the central Caribbean, whereas statistical and hurricane models suggested the potential for Harvey to be near hurricane strength in later days.[12] Over the next day, the storm changed little in structure, remaining poorly organized with its low-level center on the eastern edge of associated deep convection.[13] Harvey's presentation began to deteriorate early on August?19; its convective pattern became elongated while the circulation became less defined. In fact, a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to find a loosely-closed circulation at 850?mb (4,781?ft), though it did locate one at lower levels.[14] Harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression at 21:00?UTC on August?19;[15] six hours later, based on continued data from a reconnaissance aircraft, it was declared an open tropical wave.[16]\\r\\nEarly on August?20, the NHC began monitoring the remnants of Harvey for redevelopment. Although the effects of strong upper-level winds and dry air were expected to limit development in the near-term, conditions were expected to become more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane conditions when the disturbance entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and especially in the Bay of Campeche.[17] Despite an increase in convective organization, the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center as it approached the Yucatn Peninsula.[18] While traversing inland, satellite images and surface observations indicated that the circulation became better defined.[19]\\r\\nA reconnaissance aircraft investigating the remnants of Harvey around 15:00?UTC on August?23 indicated that it once again acquired a well-defined center, and the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression accordingly.[20] The system began to slowly consolidate amid an increasingly favorable environment,[21] attaining tropical storm intensity by 06:00?UTC on August?24.[22] Later that morning, Harvey began to undergo rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell.[23] By 17:00?UTC, the storm was upgraded to the third hurricane of the season.[24] Slight entrainment of dry air slowed the intensification process, however, by the next day, Harvey was able to quickly strengthen into a Category?3 major hurricane by 19:00?UTC.[25] Further deepening occurred as the storm approached the coast of Texas, with Harvey becoming a Category?4 hurricane at 23:00?UTC, based on reconnaissance aircraft data.[26] Around 03:00?UTC on August?26, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity at Rockport with winds of 130?mph (215?km/h) and an atmospheric pressure of 938?mbar (27.7?inHg).[27] Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since Charley in 2004. It was the first hurricane to strike Texas since Hurricane Ike in 2008,[28] the first major hurricane in the state since Bret in 1999, and the strongest in Texas since Carla in 1961.[29]\\r\\nAfter striking land, the storm moved over the Copano Bay and made a second landfall in Texas just north of Holiday Beach at 06:00?UTC on August?26 as a Category?3 hurricane.[30] Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl, and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm at 18:00?UTC on August?26.[31] For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, positioning itself near or just off the Texas coast at Matagorda by 15:00 UTC on August 28.[32] Once offshore, convection blossomed and allowed the once-exposed low-level circulation to become obscured. An Air Force reconnaissance plane investigating the system during the afternoon of August?29 found that maximum winds had increased to 50?mph (85?km/h).[33] Around 09:00?UTC the next morning, Harvey made its third and final landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana, with winds of 45?mph (75?km/h).[34]\\r\\nThe system continued north and then north-northeast, weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana around 00:00?UTC on August?30.[35] Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September?1, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 15:00?UTC that day.[36] However, Harvey's remnants continued moving northeastward, while slowly weakening. Late on September 2, the WPC issued its final advisory on Harvey's remnant low, while it was located over Ohio.[37] Harvey's remnants continued to drift northward, before being absorbed by another low pressure system north of Lake Erie, late on September 3.[38]\\r\\nTropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Windward Islands were issued starting at 15:00?UTC on August?17, about six hours before Harvey developed. At that time, a tropical storm watch was posted for Dominica, while a tropical storm warning became in effect in Barbados, Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.[11] All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on August?18, as the storm continued westward into the Caribbean.[39]\\r\\nIn Honduras, a green alert was issued for the Atlntida, Islas de la Baha, Col܇n, Corts, Gracias a Dios, Olancho, and Yoro departments. About 8 inches (20?cm) of precipitation was expected along the coast, while inland areas were forecast to receive 2.76 to 3.15?in (7.0 to 8.0?cm) of rain.[40] As the remnants of Harvey approached Mexico, the Civil Protection Secretary of the state of Campeche issued a blue alert, indicting minimal danger.[41] When Harvey redeveloped at 15:00?UTC on August?23, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch in Tamaulipas from Boca De Catan to the mouth of the Rio Grande.[42] The watch remained in effect until 21:00?UTC on August?25, after it became evident that the storm no longer posed a significant threat to that area.[43]\\r\\nFEMA worked with the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prepare for the storm and its aftermath. The agency placed disaster response teams on standby at emergency posts in Austin, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[44]\\r\\nComments from the White House (begin at 25:50)\\r\\nComments from National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini\\r\\nShelter in place briefing by FEMA\\r\\nComments by the Governor of Texas\\r\\nUpon the NHC resuming advisories for Harvey at 15:00?UTC on August?23, a hurricane watch was issued in Texas from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass, while a tropical storm watch was posted from Port Mansfield south to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from San Luis Pass to High Island. Additionally, a storm surge watch became in effect from Port Mansfield to High Island.[42] Additional watches and warnings were posted in these areas at 09:00?UTC on August?24, with a hurricane warning from Port Mansfield to Matagorda; a tropical storm warning from Matagorda to High Island; a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande; a storm surge warning from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass; and a storm surge from Port Mansfield to the Rio Grande.[45] The watches and warnings were adjusted accordingly after Harvey moved inland and began weakening, with the warning discontinued at 15:00?UTC on August?26.[46] By 09:00?UTC on the following day, only a tropical storm warning and a storm surge warning remained in effect from Port O'Connor to Sargent. However, watches and warnings were re-issued as Harvey began to re-emerge into the Gulf of Mexico, and beginning at 15:00?UTC on August?28, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire Gulf Coast of Texas from High Island northward.[47]\\r\\nGovernor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 30?counties on August?23, while mandatory evacuations were issued for Brazoria, Calhoun, Jackson, Refugio, San Patricio, and Victoria counties, as well as parts of Matagorda County.[48] On August?26, Governor Abbott added an additional 20?counties to the state of emergency declaration.[49] Furthermore, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the USGS on behalf of the Governor's Texas Emergency Management Council, including the Texas Division of Emergency Management, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage.[50]\\r\\nIn Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency for the entire state. A mandatory evacuation was ordered in Cameron Parish for the cities of Big Lake, Cameron, Creole, Grand Chenier, Hackberry, Holly Beach, and Johnson Bayou. Additionally, a voluntary evacuation was ordered in Vermilion Parish for low-lying areas south of State Highway 14. The Louisiana National Guard prepared about 500,000?sandbags and emergency boats and high-water-rescue vehicles were placed on standby should flooding occur. In New Orleans, there were concerns about whether or not the city's drainage system could handle a heavy rainfall event, with only 105?of the 120?water pumps being operational and some power turbines being out of service.[51] The city's public schools, as well as six universities and a medical school, closed on August 29.[52] As Harvey began re-emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on August?28, the tropical storm warning in Texas from Mesquite Bay to High Island was extended eastward into Louisiana to the community of Cameron at 12:00?UTC, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Cameron to Intracoastal City.[47]\\r\\nWinds left residents throughout Barbados without electricity, with a majority of outages occurring in Christ Church, Saint Joseph, Saint Lucy, and Saint Michael provinces. Flooding washed one house off its foundation, while water entered some houses, forcing some people to evacuate. Bridges in Saint Andrew and Saint Joseph were damaged. Additionally, a fuel depot in Speightstown was flooded. Winds deroofed a church.[53] In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, nine homes were flooded and four others experienced wind damage. Also, a tree fell on a school, damaging the building. Blocked drains in Port Elizabeth resulted in more than 15?businesses being flooded. A total of 15?people were housed in shelters after the storm.[1]\\r\\nStrong winds and heavy rainfall also affected Suriname and Guyana. In the former, high winds in the capital city of Paramaribo caused roof damage to the Presidential Palace and two homes, while the Torarica Hotel and Casino suffered structural impact. Additionally, four dwellings were deroofed in Commewijne and three others lost their roofs in Wanica; in the latter, the Ministry of Social Affairs building was damaged by falling trees. In Guyana, the village of Jawalla bore the brunt of the storm. Four homes were demolished, while five other residences and two shops were damaged. Several public buildings were also damaged, including the community center, the village council buildings, the nursery, and public schools. A 29-year-old woman died after her house collapsed on her.[1]\\r\\nThroughout Texas, more than 300,000?people were left without electricity and billions of dollars of property damage was sustained.[49] As of September 26, at least 73 fatalities have been confirmed, most of which were drownings.[2] By August?29, 2017 approximately 13,000?people had been rescued across the state while an estimated 30,000 were displaced.[54] The refinery industry capacity was reduced, and oil and gas production was affected in the Gulf of Mexico and inland Texas.[55] On Monday, various news outlets announced the closure of oil refineries ahead of Hurricane Harvey, creating an artificial fuel shortage. Panicked, motorists waited in long lines. Consequently, gas stations through the state were forced to close due to the rush.[56] More than 20 percent of refining capacity was affected[57].\\r\\nMore than 48,700 homes were affected by Harvey throughout the state, including over 1,000 that were completely destroyed and more than 17,000 that sustained major damage; approximately 32,000 sustained minor damage. Nearly 700 businesses were damaged as well.[58] Texas Department of Public Safety stated more than 185,000 homes were damaged and 9,000 destroyed.[59]\\r\\nMaking landfall as a Category?4, Harvey inflicted tremendous damage across Aransas County.[60] Wind gusts were observed up to 132?mph (212?km/h) near Port Aransas.[61] In Rockport, entire blocks were leveled by the hurricane's winds. The city's courthouse was severely damaged when a cargo trailer was hurled into it, coming to a stop halfway through the structure. The gymnasium of the Rockport-Fulton High School lost multiple walls while the school itself suffered some damage.[60] A Fairfield Inn in the city was severely damaged.[62] One person died in a house fire in the city, unable to be rescued due to the extreme weather conditions.[63] As of August?28, an estimated 30ÿ40?people remain unaccounted for across Aransas County, including 9 in Rockport. Nearly every structure in Port Aransas suffered damage.[60] By the afternoon of August?26, more than 20?in (51?cm) of rain had fallen in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area.[49] All of Victoria was left without water and most had no power.[60]\\r\\nMany locations in the Houston metropolitan area observed at least 30?in (76?cm) of precipitation,[64] with a maximum of 64.58?in (164.0?cm) in Nederland.[65] This makes Harvey the wettest tropical cyclone on record for both Texas and the United States,[66] surpassing the previous rainfall record held by Tropical Storm Amelia.[67] The local National Weather Service office in Houston observed all-time record daily rainfall accumulations on both August?26 and 27, measured at 14.4?in (37?cm) and 16.08?in (40.8?cm) respectively.[68] Multiple flash flood emergencies were issued in the Houston area by the National Weather Service beginning the night of August 26. In Pearland, a suburb south of Houston, a report was made of 9.92\\" of rainfall in 90 minutes.[69] The 39.11?in (99.3?cm) of rain in August made the month the wettest ever recorded in Houston since record keeping began in 1892, more than doubling the previous record of 19.21?in (48.8?cm) in June 2001.[70] The storm surge peaked at 6 feet at Port Lavaca,[71][72] reducing outflow of rainwater from land to sea.[73]\\r\\nDuring the storm, more than 800 Houston area flights were canceled, including 704?at George Bush Intercontinental Airport and 123?at William P. Hobby Airport. Both airports eventually closed.[74] Several tornadoes were spawned in the area, one of which damaged or destroyed the roofs of dozens of homes in Sienna Plantation.[49] As of August?29, 14?fatalities have been confirmed from flooding in the Houston area, including 6 from the same family who died when their van was swept off a flooded bridge.[75] A police officer drowned while trying to escape rising waters.[76]\\r\\nAn estimated 25ÿ30?percent of Harris Countyroughly 444?mi2 (1,150?km2) of landwas submerged.[54]\\r\\nLate on August?27, a mandatory evacuation was issued for all of Bay City as model projections indicated the downtown area would be inundated by 10?ft (3.0?m) of water. Flooding was anticipated to cut off access to the city around 1:00?p.m. CDT on August?28.[77] Evacuations took place in Conroe on August?28 following release of water from the Lake Conroe dam.[78] On the morning on August?29, a levee along Columbia Lakes in Brazoria County was breached, prompting officials to urgently request for everyone in the area to evacuate.[79][80]\\r\\nOn August 28, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began controlled water releases from Addicks and Barker Reservoirs in the Buffalo Bayou watershed in an attempt to manage flood levels in the immediate area. According to the local Corps commander, \\"Its going to be better to release the water through the gates directly into Buffalo Bayou as opposed to letting it go around the end and through additional neighborhoods and ultimately into the bayou.\\" At the time the releases started, the reservoirs had been rising at more than 6 inches (15?cm) per hour.[81] Many people began evacuating the area, fearing a levee breach.[82] Despite attempts to alleviate the water rise, the Addicks Reservoir reached capacity on the morning of August?29 and began spilling out.[83] The NASA Johnson Space Center has been closed to employees and visitors due to the flooding until September 5. Only the critical mission control staff remain and reside in the control rooms to monitor procedures of the International Space Station.[84]\\r\\nThe BeaumontÿPort Arthur metropolitan area also experienced torrential precipitation, including 32.55?in (82.7?cm) of rainfall in Beaumont.[64] Rising waters of the Neches River caused the city to lose service from its main pump station, as well as its secondary water source in Hardin County, cutting water supply to the city for an unknown amount of time.[86] Flooding to the north and east of the Houston area resulted in mandatory evacuations for portions of Liberty, Jefferson, and Tyler counties, while Jasper and Newton counties were under a voluntary evacuation.[87] One death occurred in Beaumont when a woman exited her disabled vehicle, but was swept away.[88] In Port Arthur, the mayor stated that the entire city was submerged by water. Hundreds of displaced residents went to the Robert A. \\"Bob\\" Bowers Civic Center for shelter, but they were evacuated again after the building began to flood. Water entered at least several hundreds of homes in Jefferson County.[89]\\r\\nHeavy rainfall extended eastward into Louisiana, with the state recording up to 14.88?in (37.8?cm) of precipitation near the town of Iowa.[64] In the town of Lake Charles, water reached 4?ft (1.2?m) in height, with homes flooded and hundreds of people forced to evacuate in one neighborhood alone. Throughout the state, about 500?people were rescued by August?28, while 269?people went to a shelter in southwest Louisiana, about 200?of whom were rescued from their homes.[90] An EF2 tornado near Evangeline damaged four homes, one of which was destroyed. The tornado also damaged fences, a motorcycle, a pickup truck, and toppled three electrical poles.[91]\\r\\nIn Alabama, a tornado in the vicinity of Reform damaged two homes and destroyed a barn along State Route 17, while four people were hospitalized for their injuries. A possible tornado in Lamar County near Kennedy caused damage to trees and roofs.[92] In Tennessee, more than 19,000?people lost electricity in Memphis.[93] Low-lying streets in the area were inundated with water. One indirect death occurred in Memphis due to a weather-related head-on collision of a car and a tractor trailer on Interstate 40.[3] Heavy rainfall in Nashville inundated a number of roads and flooded an apartment complex, resulting in the evacuation of 13?people. Overall, about 50?people in the city evacuated from flooded areas.[94]\\r\\nEnergy production in the Gulf of Mexico declined in the wake of Harvey by approximately 21%  378,633 barrels per day of the 1.75 million barrels of oil produced each day. Natural gas production declined by about 25.71%  827.89 million metric standard cubic meters per day (MMSCFD). The Eagle Ford Rock Formation (shale oil and gas) in southern Texas reduced production by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd, according to the Texas Railroad Commission. Many energy-related ports and terminals are closed, delaying about fourteen crude oil tankers. About 2.25 million bpd of refining capacity was offline for several days; that is about 12% of total US capacity, with refineries affected at Corpus Christi, and later Port Arthur and Beaumont, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The price of Brent crude versus West Texas Intermediate crude oil achieved a split of U.S.?$5.[95]\\r\\nTwo ExxonMobil refineries had to be shut down following related storm damage and releases of hazardous pollutants.[96] Two oil storage tanks owned by Burlington Resources Oil and Gas collectively spilled 30,000?gallons of crude in DeWitt County. An additional 8,500?gallons of wastewater was spilled in the incidents.[97]\\r\\nOn August 30, the CEO of Arkema warned one of its chemical plants in Crosby, Texas, could explode or be subject to intense fire due to the loss of \\"critical refrigeration\\" of materials.[98] All workers at the facility and residents within 1.5?mi (2.4?km) were evacuated. Eight of the plant's nine refrigeration units failed without power, enabling the stored chemicals to decompose and become combustible. Two explosions occurred around 2:00?a.m. on August?31; 21?emergency personnel were briefly hospitalized.[99]\\r\\nDue to the shutdown in refineries, gas prices did see an increase nationwide.[100] However, the increase was not as extensive as Hurricane Katrina due to the development of more fuel-efficient vehicles as well as fracking technology having been refined since Katrina to allow oil drilling in shale areas such as the Marcellus Formation.[101] Additionally, Harvey's impact coincided with Labor Day Weekend, which sees a traditional increase in gas prices due to the heavy travel for that weekend.[102] Nonetheless, the spike brought the highest gas prices in two years.[101]\\r\\nThe flooding in Houston from the storm required the traditional Governor's Cup National Football League preseason game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans scheduled for August 31 to be moved from NRG Stadium in Houston to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.[103] The game was later cancelled to allow the Houston Texans players to return to Houston after the storm.[104] In addition, the Houston Astros were forced to move their August 29ÿ31 series with the Texas Rangers from Minute Maid Park in Houston to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida;[105] ironically, just two weeks later, Hurricane Irma would force the stadium's regular tenants, the Tampa Bay Rays, to move three home games to Citi Field in New York City.[106] The annual Texas Kickoff game that was to feature BYU and LSU to kick off the 2017 college football season was moved to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.[107] The NCAA FBS football game between Houston and UTSA was postponed due to the aftermath of the storm. It was originally scheduled for September 2 at the Alamodome in San Antonio and is expected to be rescheduled.[108]\\r\\nThe Houston Dynamo rescheduled a planned Major League Soccer match against Sporting Kansas City on August 26 to October 11. The Houston Dash of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their August 27 match against the North Carolina Courage to a date that has not been announced.[109] Both teams moved their training camps to Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas (near Dallas) while preparing for their next matches; the Dash's match the following week, against the Seattle Reign, will be played in Frisco, with all proceeds from ticket sales benefiting an American Red Cross relief fund for hurricane victims.[110] The Dynamo and Major League Soccer also donated a combined $1 million into the hurricane relief fund, while also opening BBVA Compass Stadium to accept donated supplies for processing and distribution.[111][112]\\r\\nAthletic events were rescheduled as far away as Kentucky, where the storm's remnants were expected to cause heavy rains on September 1, interfering with Friday night high school football. More than 50 high schools in the state moved games that had been scheduled for Friday to either Thursday or Saturday.[113]\\r\\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner imposed a mandatory curfew on August?29 from 12?a.m. to 5?a.m. local time until further notice. He cited looting as the primary reason for the curfew.[114] On August?29, President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz toured damage in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area.[115] President Trump made a formal request for $5.95?billion in federal funding on August?31 for affected areas, the vast majority of which would go to FEMA.[116]\\r\\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott deployed the state's entire National Guard for search and rescue, recovery, and clean up operations due to the devastating damage caused by the storm and resulting floods.[117][118] Other states' National Guard's have offered assistance, with several having already been sent.[119][120] Meanwhile, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement assigned approximately 150 employees from around the country to assist with disaster relief efforts, while stating that no immigration enforcement operations would be conducted.[58]\\r\\nApproximately 32,000?people were displaced in shelters across the state by August?31. The George R. Brown Convention Center, the state's largest shelter, reached capacity with 8,000?evacuees. The NRG Center opened as a large public shelter accordingly. More than 210,000?people registered with FEMA for disaster assistance.[121]\\r\\nThe Cajun Navy, an informal organization of volunteers with boats from Louisiana, deployed to Texas to assist in high-water rescues.[122]\\r\\nThe Houston Independent School District announced that all students on any of the district's campuses would be eligible for free lunch throughout the 2017ÿ18 school year. The Federal Department of Education eased financial aid rules and procedures for those affected by Harvey, giving schools the ability to waive paperwork requirements; loan borrowers were given more flexibility in managing their loan payments.[58] A 36-year-old inmate sentenced to death for a 2003 murder was granted a temporary reprieve as a result of Harvey, as his legal team was based in Harris County, an area heavily affected by the hurricane.[58]\\r\\nBy August?30, corporations across the nation collectively donated more than $72?million to relief efforts, with 42?companies donating at least $1?million.[123] Professional athletic teams, their players, and managers provided large donations to assist victims of the storm. The Houston Astros pledged $4?million to relief along with all proceeds from their home game raffles. Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander also donated $4?million to the cause.[124] A fundraiser established by Houston Texans defensive lineman J. J. Watt exceeded $37?million.[125] The Texas Rangers and Tennessee Titans both provided $1?million, while the New England Patriots pledged to match up to $1?million in donations to the Red Cross.[126] Multiple Hollywood celebrities also pitched in, collectively donating more than $10?million, with Sandra Bullock providing the largest single donation of $1?million.[127] Leonardo DiCaprio provided $1?million to the United Way Harvey Recovery Fund through his foundation.[128] President Donald Trump reportedly donated $1?million to 12 charities involved in relief efforts.[129] Rachael Ray provided donations totaling $1?million to animal shelters across the Houston area.[130]\\r\\nBased on current damage estimates made by multiple agencies, Hurricane Harvey is likely to be at least the second-most costly natural disaster in U.S. history, behind only Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[5][131] Moody's Analytics has estimated the total economic cost of the storm at $81 billion to $108 billion or more; most of the economic losses are damage to homes and commercial property.[5] USA Today reported an AccuWeather estimate of $190 billion, released August 31.[132] On September 3, Texas state governor Greg Abbott estimated that damages will be between $150?billion and $180?billion, surpassing the $120?billion that it took to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina.[133][134] According to weather analytics firm Planalytics, lost revenue to Houston area retailers and restaurants alone will be approximately $1 billion. The Houston area controls 4% of the spending power in the United States.[135]\\r\\nIn September 2017, the Insurance Council of Texas estimated the total insured losses from Hurricane Harvey at $19 billion. This figure represents $11 billion in flood losses insured by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), $3 billion in \\"insured windstorm and other storm-related property losses\\"; and about $4.75 billion in insured flood losses of private and commercial vehicles.[136]\\r\\nA significant portion of the storm's damages may be uninsured losses. Regular homeowner insurance policies generally exclude coverage for flooding, as the NFIP underwrites most flood insurance policies in the US.[137][138] Although the purchase of flood insurance is obligatory for federally guaranteed mortgages for homes within the 100-year flood plain, enforcement of the requirement is difficult and many homes, even within the 100-year flood plain, lack flood insurance.[137] In Harris County, Texaswhich includes the city of Houstononly 15% of homes have flood insurance policies issued by the NFIP. Participation in the NFIP is higher, but still low, in neighboring Galveston (41%), Brazoria (26%), and Chambers Counties (21%).[137] Homeowners sued authorities after reservoir releases damaged homes.[139]\\r\\nOn September 8, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 601, which among other spending actions designated $15 billion for Hurricane Harvey relief.[140]\\r\\nThe American Red Cross, Salvation Army, United States Equestrian Federation, Humane Society of the United States, Knights of Columbus, Catholic Charities USA, AmeriCares, Operation BBQ relief, many celebrities, and many other charitable organizations provided help to the victims of the storm. [141][142][143] Anarchists (including Antifa) also provided relief.[144] Business aviation played a part in the rescue efforts, providing support during the storm as well as relief flights bringing in suppliers in the immediate aftermath.[145]\\r\\nVolunteers from amateur radio's emergency service wing, the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, provided communications in American Red Cross shelters in South Texas. [146]\\r\\nMany corporations also contributed to relief efforts. Operation BBQ relief had the help from several local individuals and businesses kick off the support of providing meals for volunteers and victims. Smokers, pallets of wood, and another company came up with the pounds of pork to kick off the support effort.[147] Although Operation BBQ relief has been in effect since May 2011 with the 2011 Joplin tornado, they estimate the Houston 2017 relief project to be their biggest ever.\\r\\nOperation BBQ relief vendors volunteering for the Houston flood relief estimates that they will serve at least 450,000 meals.[148] On August 27, 2017 it was estimated that Operation BBQ relief will be expecting 25,000 to 30,000 meals a day.[149]\\r\\nOn August 27, 2017 KSL-TV, KSL Newsradio, FM100.3, and 103.5 The Arrow created a fundraiser to help Texas residents impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Because of an anonymous donor willing to match $2 for every $1 raised up to a total of $100,000, Peter Huntsman also agreed to match donations up to $100,000. The combined total of $200,000 was met by August 31, 2017. Their new goal is $1 million.[150]\\r\\nSingapore dispatched Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Republic of Singapore Air Force to areas affected by the hurricane for humanitarian operations, working alongside the Texas National Guard.[151] Israel pledged $1 million in relief funds for restoration of non-state run communal infrastructure.[152] Mexico sent volunteers from the Mexican Red Cross, firemen from Coahuila, and rescue teams from Guanajuato to Houston to assist in relief.[153] Mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after Hurricane Katia made landfall on Mexico's Gulf Coast, on September 9, 2017.[154] Venezuela offered $5 million through the state-owned Citgo Petroleum, which operates a refinery in Corpus Christi.[155]\\r\\nThe floodwaters contain a number of hazards to the environment and human health. The Houston Health Department stated that \\"millions of contaminants\\" were present in floodwaters.[156] These include E. coli and coliform bacteria; measurements of colony-forming units showed the concentrations were so high that there were risks of contracting flesh-eating disease from the water.[157]\\r\\nHouston officials stated that the Houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact; however, \\"hundreds of thousands of people across the 38 Texas counties affected by Hurricane Harvey use private wells, according to an estimate by Louisiana State University researchers, and those people must fend for themselves.\\"[156] Additionally, Harris County, which includes Houston, contains a large number of Superfund-designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens.[156] Two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi were flooded.[156]\\r\\nThe Geography of Houston places it in a low-lying part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, and its clay-based soils provide poor drainage. The climate of Houston brings very heavy rainfall, which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836, though the flood control district founded in 1947, aided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years. More recently, residents died in \\"historic flooding\\" in May 2015, and in the April 2016 \\"tax day floods\\".[158][159] There is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region, and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period, as occurred during Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979, and Tropical Storm Allison in 2001.[160]\\r\\nThe area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient, slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea. The main waterways, the San Jacinto River and the Buffalo Bayou, meander slowly, laden with mud, and have little capacity for carrying storm water.[161]\\r\\nHouston has seen rapid urban development (urban sprawl), with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water, overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels.[162] Between 1992 and 2010, almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost, decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons.[163] However, Harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area.[164]\\r\\nThe Katy Prairie in western Harris County, which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region, has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development, and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in Harris County since 2010.[165]\\r\\nExtraction of oil and groundwater from underground aquifers leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse, a process called subsidence. Houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl, with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence: in some cases as much as 9 feet (2.7?m). These result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently, so storm water drains more slowly.[166] The coastline near Houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches (15?cm) in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the effects of climate change.[167][166]\\r\\nThe Gulf of Mexico is known for hurricanes in August, so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming, but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms. Studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall.[168] Weather events are due to multiple factors, and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition, but climate change affects aspects of extreme events, and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey.[169] In a briefing, the World Meteorological Organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from Harvey had very likely been increased by climate change. The relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes (or tropical cyclones) is still unclear, and is the subject of continuing research.[170]\\r\\nHarvey approached Houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures. Warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes, and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger, more intense and longer lasting, in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall.[171][168] Sea level rise added to the resulting problems.[169] According to officials from the Harris County Flood Control District, Harvey caused the third '500-year' flood in three years. [172][173][174] The National Climate Assessment states:\\r\\nThe recent increases in activity are linked, in part, to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that Atlantic hurricanes form in and move through. Numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures, including natural variability, human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases, and particulate pollution. Quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research.[175]\\r\\nWarmer air can hold more water vapour, in accordance with the ClausiusÿClapeyron relation, and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records.[169] Regional sea surface temperatures around Houston have risen around 0.5?C (0.9?F) in recent decades, which caused a 3ÿ5% increase in moisture in the atmosphere. This had the effect of allowing Harvey to strengthen more than expected.[167] The water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico was above average for this time of the year, and likely to be a factor in Harvey's impact.[176] Within a week of Harvey Hurricane Irma formed due to the same unusually warm sea-water. Some scientists fear this may be becoming a 'new normal'. Also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating.[177]\\r\\nThe slow movement of Harvey over Texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state, as has also happened with earlier storms.[160] Harvey's stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the time, which had pushed the jet stream to the north. Research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change.[167][178]\\r\\nOther tropical cyclones that made landfall in the same region of the Texas Gulf coast:","input":"Where did hurricane harvey make its first landfall?"},{"output":"Warren Buffett","context":"The World's Billionaires is an annual ranking by net worth of the world's wealthiest billionaires compiled and published in March annually by the American business magazine Forbes. The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated, in United States dollars, based on their assets and accounting for debt. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3]\\r\\nIn 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed, that included 195 newcomers that included 76 from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[4] The average net worth of the list came in at US$3.75?billion, down US$110?million from 2015. Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67?trillion, up from US$7.1?trillion in 2015.[2][5] As of 2017[update], Microsoft founder Bill Gates has topped the list 18 of the past 23 years.[2]\\r\\nAccording to a 2017 Oxfam report, the top eight billionaires own as much combined wealth as \\"half the human race\\".[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of more than 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals.[8] Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses?ÿ some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[9] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets?ÿ land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc.?ÿ are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[8]\\r\\nFamily fortunes dispersed over a large number of relatives are included only if those individuals' holdings are worth more than a billion dollars. However, when a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members, it is included under a single listing provided that individual is still living.[8] Kings, queens and dictators that have their wealth due to their role as are always excluded from these lists.[10]\\r\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worth listed are snapshots taken at that time.

The U.S. continues to have the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China has 319 (not including Hong Kong or Macau), Germany has 114, and India has the fourth most with 101; India has reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\\r\\nFor the third year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's 2016 list of the world's billionaires.[11] This is the 17th time that the founder of Microsoft has claimed the top spot. Amancio Ortega rose from last year's position of number four to second.[12] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway came in third for the second consecutive time,[13] while Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim slipped down from last year's second position to fourth. Jeff Bezos of Amazon,[14] Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook[15] and Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg L.P.,[16] appear for the first time on the Forbes top 10 billionaires list, coming at fifth, sixth and eighth position, respectively. Zuckerberg became the youngest top 10 billionaire this year at the age of 31. Larry Ellison, Charles Koch and David Koch also slipped down from their last year's positions, with Ellison dropping to seventh from fifth and the Kochs falling to ninth position from sixth, respectively.\\r\\nIn the 29th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, a record 1,826 billionaires were named with an aggregated net worth of $7.1 trillion compared to $6.4 trillion last year. 46 of the billionaires in this list are under the age of 40. A record number of 290 people joined the list for the first time, of whom 25 percent hail from China, which produced a world-leading 71 newcomers. The United States came in second, with 57, followed by India, with 28, and Germany, with 23.[17] The United States has the largest number of billionaires with 526. Russia went down to 88 from 111 in 2014. Russia was placed behind China, Germany and India by the number of billionaires. Self-made billionaires made up the largest number of people on the list with 1,191 positions (over 65 percent) while just 230 (under 13 percent) have wealth through inheritance. The number of billionaires who inherited a portion but are still working to increase their fortunes is 405.[18]\\r\\nBill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's annual list of the world's billionaires. This was the 16th time that the founder of Microsoft claimed the top spot. Carlos Slim came in second for the second consecutive time. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway was placed third, while Amancio Ortega of Spain, slipped down a position from last year to number four. Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle rounded off the top five. Christy Walton was the highest-ranking female at number eight. America's Evan Spiegel, co-founder of photo messaging app Snapchat became the youngest billionaire this year at the age of 24. At age 99, David Rockefeller maintained his position as the oldest billionaire to be included in the list.[19] Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, rose to number 16 with $33.4 billion. Iceland had a billionaire, Thor Bjorgolfsson, in the list after a gap of five years. Guatemala had a billionaire, Mario Lopez Estrada, for the first time in its history.[20]\\r\\nBill Gates added $9 billion to his fortune since 2013 and topped the Forbes 2014 billionaire list. He has topped the list 15 of the previous 20 years, but his last number one ranking in 2009.[21] Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim came in second place after being number one the previous four years. Zara founder Amancio Ortega placed third for the second consecutive year. American investor Warren Buffett was in the top five for the 20th consecutive year, placing fourth.[22] America's Christy Walton was the highest ranking female, placing ninth overall.[1] Aliko Dangote of Nigeria became the first African ever to enter the top 25, with an estimated net worth of $25 billion.[3]\\r\\nA total of 1,645 people made the 2014 billionaire list, representing combined wealth of $6.4 trillion.[22] Of those, a record 268 were newcomers, surpassing 2008's 226 newcomers.[1] One hundred people listed in 2013 failed to make the list.[22] The number of women on the list rose to a record 172 in 2014.[1] Approximately 66 percent of the list was self-made, 13 percent achieved their wealth through inheritance alone, and 21 percent through a mixture of the two.[3]\\r\\nThe United States had 492 billionaires on the list, the most of any country.[22] The country also had the most newcomers with 50, and women with 54.[1] China had the second most billionaires with 152, while Russia was third with 111.[22] Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania, and Uganda were all represented on the list for the first time. Turkey saw the most people drop off the list, 19, due to a period of high inflation in the country.[3]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2013 billionaire list, marking his fourth consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates remained in second, while Amancio Ortega moved up to third. Ortega's gain of $19.5 billion was the largest of anyone on the list.[23] Warren Buffett failed to make the top three for the first time since 2000, placing fourth. Diesel founder Renzo Rosso was among the top newcomers, debuting with an estimate net worth of $3 billion.[24]\\r\\nA global rise in asset prices, led Forbes editor Randall Lane to declare \\"It [was] a very good year to be a billionaire\\". However, it was not a good year to be Eike Batista who fell from seventh to 100th, suffering the largest net loss of anyone on the list.[23] Overall, net gainers outnumbered net losers by 4:1.[24]\\r\\nA record total of 1,426 people made the 2013 list, representing $5.4 trillion of assets.[25] Of those, 442 billionaires hailed from the United States.[23] The Asian-Pacific region had 386 billionaires and Europe 366. The list also featured a record number of newcomers, 210, representing 42 different countries. Sixty people from the 2012 list fell below a billion dollar of assets in 2013 and eight others from the 2012 list died. The Asia-Pacific region had the most drop-offs, with 29, followed by the United States with 16. The 2013 list featured 138 women, of which 50 came from the United States. A majority of the list (961 individuals, 67 percent) was entirely self-made; 184 (13 percent) inherited their wealth, and 281 (20 percent) achieved their fortune through a combination of inheritance and business acumen.[25]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2012 list, marking this third consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates placed second, but narrowed the gap from 2011 as Slim's fortune fell $5 billion while Gates' rose $5 billion. Warren Buffett remained in third place. Bernard Arnault of France was the top-ranking European on the list, placing fourth.[26] Ricardo Salinas Pliego was the greatest gainer in terms of dollars, adding $9.2 billion to his fortune and moving up to number 37 overall.[26] Making her debut on the list at age 27, Spanx founder Sara Blakely became the youngest self-made female billionaire ever.[27] Colombia's Alejandro Santo Domingo was the highest-ranked newcomer, inheriting a $9.5 billion stake in Santo Domingo Group from his father.[26] India's Lakshmi Mittal was the largest loser as his fortune dropped from $31.1 billion to $20.7 billion as the price of steel maker ArcelorMittal fell sharply.[26] As a result, he failed to make the top 10 for the first time since 2004 and lost his title of richest Asian to Hong Kongs Li Ka-shing.[28]\\r\\nA record total of 1,226 people made the 2012 list, representing 58 different countries. Of those, 126 were newcomers to the list and 104 were women. The United States had the greatest number of billionaires with 425. Russia had 96 people on the list, while China had 95.[26] Georgia, Morocco, and Peru were newly represented on the list. Falling stock prices in Asia contributed to 117 former billionaires falling from the list worldwide. Twelve others listed in 2011 died. Overall, net gainers (460) barely outnumbered net losers (441).[28]\\r\\nTo coincide with the release of the 2012 list, Forbes announced a new \\"Billionaire Real-Time Ticker\\" updating the wealth of the world's top fifty billionaires in real time.[26]\\r\\nIn the 25th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, Carlos Slim added $20.5 billion to his fortune, the most of anyone, and retained his number one ranking with a total fortune of $74 billion. Bill Gates remained in second place with $56 billion, while Warren Buffett was third with $50 billion. The top 10 had a combined wealth of $406 billion, up from $342 billion in 2010.[29] According to Forbes editor Kerry Dolan, \\"media and technology billionaires definitely benefited from a stronger stock market and a growing enthusiasm for all things social\\" since the 2010 list.[30] However, Nigerian commodity mogul Aliko Dangote was the greatest gainer on a percentage basis as his fortune increased 557 percent to $13.5 billion. Mark Zuckerberg was one of seven Facebook-related billionaires on the list, as he $9.5 billion to his fortune to move up to 52nd. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz was the youngest person on the list. Aged 26, eight days younger than Zuckerberg, he debuted at number 420 with an estimated fortune of $2.7 billion. IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad was the largest loser as he saw his fortune plummet from $23 billion to $6 billion, dropping him from 11th to 162nd overall.[29]\\r\\nA record 1,210 billionaires made the 2011 list, representing a combined wealth of $4.5 trillion, up from $3.6 trillion the previous year.[31] One third of the world's billionaires, 413, came from the United States. China had the second most billionaires with 115, while Russia was third with 101. Asia moved up to 332 billionaires, passing Europe as a region for the first time since the 1990s.[29] The 2011 list included 214 newcomers and the average net worth of those on it increased to $3.7 billion.[30]\\r\\nCarlos Slim narrowly eclipsed Bill Gates to top the billionaire list for the first time. Slim saw his estimated worth surge $18.5 billion to $53.5 billion as shares of America Movil rose 35 percent. Gates' estimated wealth rose $13 billion to $53 billion, placing him second. Warren Buffett was third with $47 billion.[32] Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, placing 12th overall, with an inherited fortune of $22.5 billion.[33] At age 25, Mark Zuckerberg continued to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[9] American Isaac Perlmutter was among the newcomers with an estimated fortune of $4 billion largely acquired in his sale of Marvel Entertainment to Disney.[32]\\r\\nA total of 1,011 people made the 2010 list. The United States accounted for 403 billionaires, followed by China with 89 and Russia with 62.[33] It was the first time China, while including Hong Kong, placed second.[32] A total of 55 countries were represented on the 2010 list, including Finland and Pakistan which claimed their first billionaires.[33] Eighty-nine women made the list, but only 14 of them were self-made.[33] The combined net worth of the list was $3.6 trillion, up 50 percent from 2009's $2.4 trillion, while the average net worth was $3.5 billion.[9]\\r\\nThe 2010 list featured 164 re-entries and 97 true newcomers.[9] Asia accounted for more than 100 of the new entrants. Overall, just 12 percent of the list lost wealth since 2009, and 30 people fell off the list. Thirteen others died.[32] Of the 89 women, 12 were newcomers in 2010. Steve Forbes said the growing number of billionaires was clear sign that the world's economy was recovering from 2009's global financial crisis.[9]\\r\\nIn June 2010, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates announce The Giving Pledge that is a promise to give the majority of their wealth to philanthropy. As of 2017, the pledge has 158 signers but some of the signers have since died. Most of the signers of the pledge are billionaires, and their pledges total to over $365 billion.[34]\\r\\nIn the wake of the Financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008, the world's billionaires lose $2 trillion in net worth and the list becomes 30% smaller than the previous year's list.\\r\\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, four years after starting the company, joins the list at 23 to become the youngest self-made billionaire.\\r\\nThe founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, become billionaires at age 30.\\r\\nOprah Winfrey becomes the first female African American billionaire.\\r\\nAs a result of the market crash caused by the Dot-com bubble, 83 billionaires drop off the list from the previous year.\\r\\nIn 2001, BET founder Robert L. Johnson became the first ever African-American billionaire.[35]\\r\\nBill Gates became the first American to take the top spot of the World's Billionaires in 1995 with a net worth of $12.5 billion and he remained there during the Dot-com bubble's height in 1999 when Gates' fortune peaked at $90 billion. After the dot-com bubble started to collapse in 2000, his wealth dropped to $60 billion although he remained at the top of the list.\\r\\nThe dot-com bubble created the most paper wealth for some billionaires. However, once the dotcom bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear.[36] Billionaires' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires.[37] The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses. Most of the richest people in the world have seen their fortunes soar in the early 2010s.[38][39]\\r\\nSource: Forbes.[5][41][40][42]","input":"Who is the second richest person of the world?"},{"output":"165,372","context":"Large denominations of United States currency greater than $100 were circulated by the United States Treasury until 1969. Since then, U.S. dollar banknotes have only been issued in seven denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge-denomination currency (i.e., banknotes with a face value of $500 or higher)[1] had been used in the United States since the late 18th century.[2] The first $500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina, authorized by legislation dated May 10, 1780.[3] Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $500 and $1,000 notes on October 16, 1780[4] and $2,000 notes on May 7, 1781.[5] High-denomination treasury notes were issued, for example during the War of 1812 ($1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30, 1812).[6] During the American Civil War Confederate currency included $500 and $1,000 notes.[7] During the Federal banknote issuing period (1861 to present), the earliest high-denomination notes included three-year Interest-bearing notes of $500, $1,000, and $5,000, authorized by Congress on July 17, 1861.[8] In total, 11 different types of U.S. currency were issued in high-denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates. The obverse of United States banknotes generally depict either historical figures, allegorical figures symbolizing significant concepts (e.g., liberty, justice), or a combination of both. The reverse designs range from abstract scroll-work with ornate denomination identifiers to reproductions of historical art works.\\r\\nSeries 1934 gold certificates ($100, $1,000, $10,000 and $100,000) were issued after the gold standard was repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9, 1933 (see United States Executive Order 6102). Thus the series 1934 notes were used only for intragovernmental (i.e., Federal Reserve Bank) transactions and were not issued to the public. This series was discontinued in 1940. The series 1928 gold certificate reverse was printed in black and green. See history of the United States dollar.\\r\\nAlthough they are still legal tender in the United States, high-denomination bills were last printed on December 27, 1945, and officially discontinued on July 14, 1969, by the Federal Reserve System,[9] due to 'lack of use'. The $5,000 and $10,000 effectively disappeared well before then.[nb 1]\\r\\nThe Federal Reserve began taking high-denomination currency out of circulation (destroying large bills received by banks) in 1969. As of May 30, 2009[update], only 336 $10,000 bills were known to exist; 342 remaining $5,000 bills; and 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills.[10] Due to their rarity, collectors often pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them. Some are in museums in other parts of the world.\\r\\nFor the most part, these bills were used by banks and the Federal government for large financial transactions. This was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934. However, for the most part, the introduction of an electronic money system has made large-scale cash transactions obsolete. When combined with concerns about counterfeiting and the use of cash in unlawful activities such as the illegal drug trade and money laundering, it is unlikely that the U.S. government will re-issue large denomination currency in the near future, despite the amount of inflation that has occurred since 1969 (a $500 bill is now worth less, in real terms, than a $100 bill was worth in 1969). According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website, \\"The present denominations of our currency in production are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal. Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution contains (among other things) the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) certified proofs and the Treasury Department collection of United States currency. Using a combination of proofs and issued notes, a nearly complete type set of high-denomination currency was compiled. Notably missing are several types of Compound and Interest Bearing Notes. Printed during the early to mid-1860s on very thin paper, these high-denomination notes are virtually non-existent. Their issuance (1861ÿ65) pre-dates the BEP's responsibility for U.S. Currency (1870s), so it is fortunate that any proofs exist in the current archives.","input":"How many 1000 dollar bills are in circulation?"},{"output":"\\"a fictional story that is presented in comic-strip format and published as a book\\"","context":"A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \\"novel\\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \\"graphic novel\\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is generally used for comics periodicals.\\r\\nFan historian Richard Kyle coined the term \\"graphic novel\\" in an essay in the November 1964 issue of the comics fanzine Capa-Alpha.[1][2] The term gained popularity in the comics community after the publication of Will Eisner's A Contract with God (1978) and the start of Marvel's Graphic Novel line (1982) and became familiar to the public in the late 1980s after the commercial successes of the first volume of Art Spiegelman's Maus in 1986 and the collected editions of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns in 1986 and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen in 1987. The Book Industry Study Group began using \\"graphic novel\\" as a category in book stores in 2001.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term is not strictly defined, though Merriam-Webster's full dictionary definition is \\"a fictional story that is presented in comic-strip format and published as a book\\", while its simplest definition is given as \\"cartoon drawings that tell a story and are published as a book\\".[4] In the publishing trade, the term extends to material that would not be considered a novel if produced in another medium.[citation needed] Collections of comic books that do not form a continuous story, anthologies or collections of loosely related pieces, and even non-fiction are stocked by libraries and bookstores as \\"graphic novels\\" (similar to the manner in which dramatic stories are included in \\"comic\\" books).[citation needed] The term is also sometimes used to distinguish between works created as standalone stories, in contrast to collections or compilations of a story arc from a comic book series published in book form.[5][6][7]\\r\\nIn continental Europe, both original book-length stories such as La rivolta dei racchi (1967) by Guido Buzzelli,[citation needed][8] and collections of comics have been commonly published in hardcover volumes, often called \\"albums\\", since the end of the 19th century (including such later Franco-Belgian comics series as The Adventures of Tintin in the 1930s,\\r\\nAs the exact definition of the graphic novel is debated, the origins of the form are open to interpretation.\\r\\nThe Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck is the oldest recognized American example of comics used to this end.[9] It originated as the 1828 publication Histoire de M. Vieux Bois by Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe T?pffer, and was first published in English translation in 1841 by London's Tilt & Bogue, which used an 1833 Paris pirate edition.[10] The first American edition was published in 1842 by Wilson & Company in New York City using the original printing plates from the 1841 edition. Another early predecessor is Journey to the Gold Diggins by Jeremiah Saddlebags by brothers J.?A.?D. and D.?F. Read, inspired by The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck.[10] In 1894 Caran d'Ache broached the idea of a \\"drawn novel\\" in a letter to the newspaper Le Figaro and started work on a 360-page wordless book (never published).[11] In the United States there is a long tradition of reissuing previously published comic strips in book form. In 1897 the Hearst Syndicate published such a collection of The Yellow Kid by Richard Outcault and it quickly became a best seller.[12]\\r\\nThe 1920s saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition, with Belgian Frans Masereel cited as \\"the undisputed king\\" of this revival.[13] His works include Passionate Journey (1919).[14] American Lynd Ward also worked in this tradition, publishing Gods' Man, in 1929 and going on to publish more during the 1930s.[15][16]\\r\\nOther prototypical examples from this period include American Milt Gross' He Done Her Wrong (1930), a wordless comic published as a hardcover book, and Une Semaine de Bont (1934), a novel in sequential images composed of collage by the surrealist painter Max Ernst. Similarly, Charlotte Salomon's Life? or Theater? (composed 1941-43) combines images, narrative, and captions.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1940s saw the launching of Classics Illustrated, a comic-book series that primarily adapted notable, public domain novels into standalone comic books for young readers. In 1947 Fawcett Comics published Comics Novel #1: \\"Anarcho, Dictator of Death\\", a 52-page comic dedicated to one story.[17] In 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \\"picture novel\\" It Rhymes with Lust, a film noir-influenced slice of steeltown life starring a scheming, manipulative redhead named Rust. Touted as \\"an original full-length novel\\" on its cover, the 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \\"Drake Waller\\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin proved successful enough to lead to an unrelated second picture novel, The Case of the Winking Buddha by pulp novelist Manning Lee Stokes and illustrator Charles Raab.[18][19] Presaging Will Eisner's multiple-story graphic novel A Contract with God (1978), cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman wrote and drew the four-story mass-market paperback Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book (Ballantine Books #338K), published in 1959.[20]\\r\\nBy the late 1960s, American comic book creators were becoming more adventurous with the form. Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin self-published a 40-page, magazine-format comics novel, His Name is... Savage (Adventure House Press) in 1968the same year Marvel Comics published two issues of The Spectacular Spider-Man in a similar format. Columnist and comic-book writer Steven Grant also argues that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's Doctor Strange story in Strange Tales #130ÿ146, although published serially from 1965ÿ1966, is \\"the first American graphic novel\\".[21] Similarly, critic Jason Sacks referred to the 13-issue \\"Panther's Rage\\"  comics' first-known titled, self-contained, multi-issue story arc  that ran from 1973 to 1975 in the Black Panther series in Marvel's Jungle Action as \\"Marvel's first graphic novel\\".[22]\\r\\nMeanwhile, in continental Europe, the tradition of collecting serials of popular strips such as The Adventures of Tintin or Asterix led to long-form narratives published initially as serials.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy 1969, the author John Updike, who had entertained ideas of becoming a cartoonist in his youth, addressed the Bristol Literary Society, on \\"the death of the novel\\". Updike offered examples of new areas of exploration for novelists, declaring \\"I see no intrinsic reason why a doubly talented artist might not arise and create a comic strip novel masterpiece\\".[23]\\r\\nGil Kane and Archie Goodwin's Blackmark (1971), a science fiction/sword-and-sorcery paperback published by Bantam Books, did not use the term originally; the back-cover blurb of the 30th-anniversary edition (ISBN?978-1-56097-456-7) calls it, retroactively, \\"the very first American graphic novel\\". The Academy of Comic Book Arts presented Kane with a special 1971 Shazam Award for what it called \\"his paperback comics novel\\". Whatever the nomenclature, Blackmark is a 119-page story of comic-book art, with captions and word balloons, published in a traditional book format. It is also the first with an original heroic-adventure character conceived expressly for this form.[citation needed]\\r\\nEuropean creators were also experimenting with the longer narrative in comics form. In the United Kingdom, Raymond Briggs was producing works such as Father Christmas (1972) and The Snowman (1978), which he himself described as being from the \\"bottomless abyss of strip cartooning\\", although they, along with such other Briggs works as the more mature When the Wind Blows (1982), have been re-marketed as graphic novels in the wake of the term's popularity. Briggs notes, however, \\"I don't know if I like that term too much\\".[24]\\r\\nIn 1976, the term \\"graphic novel\\" appeared in print to describe three separate works. Bloodstar by Richard Corben (adapted from a story by Robert E. Howard) used the term to define itself on its dust jacket and introduction. George Metzger's Beyond Time and Again, serialized in underground comics from 1967 to 1972, was subtitled \\"A Graphic Novel\\" on the inside title page when collected as a 48-page, black-and-white, hardcover book published by Kyle & Wheary.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe digest-sized Chandler: Red Tide (1976) by Jim Steranko, designed to be sold on newsstands, used the term \\"graphic novel\\" in its introduction and \\"a visual novel\\" on its cover, although Chandler is more commonly considered[citation needed] an illustrated novel than a work of comics.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe following year, Terry Nantier, who had spent his teenage years living in Paris, returned to the United States and formed Flying Buttress Publications, later to incorporate as NBM Publishing (Nantier, Beall, Minoustchine), and published Racket Rumba, a 50-page spoof of the noir-detective genre, written and drawn by the single-name French artist Loro. Nantier followed this with Enki Bilal's The Call of the Stars. The company marketed these works as \\"graphic albums\\".[25]\\r\\nThe first six issues of writer-artist Jack Katz's 1974 Comics and Comix Co. series The First Kingdom were collected as a trade paperback (Pocket Books, March 1978),[26] which described itself as \\"the first graphic novel\\". Issues of the comic had described themselves as \\"graphic prose\\", or simply as a novel.[citation needed]\\r\\nSimilarly, Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species by writer Don McGregor and artist Paul Gulacy (Eclipse Books, August 1978)the first graphic novel sold in the newly created \\"direct market\\" of United States comic-book shops[27]was called a \\"graphic album\\" by the author in interviews, though the publisher dubbed it a \\"comic novel\\" on its credits page. \\"Graphic album\\" was also the term used the following year by Gene Day for his hardcover short-story collection Future Day (Flying Buttress Press).\\r\\nAnother early graphic novel, though it carried no self-description, was The Silver Surfer (Simon & Schuster/Fireside Books, August 1978), by Marvel Comics' Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Significantly, this was published by a traditional book publisher and distributed through bookstores, as was cartoonist Jules Feiffer's Tantrum (Alfred A. Knopf, 1979)[28] described on its dustjacket as a \\"novel-in-pictures\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nHyperbolic descriptions of longer comic books as \\"novels\\" appear on covers as early as the 1940s. Early issues of DC Comics' All-Flash Quarterly, for example, described their contents as \\"novel-length stories\\" and \\"full-length four chapter novels.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn its earliest known citation, comic book reviewer Richard Kyle used the term \\"graphic novel\\" in CAPA-ALPHA #2 (November 1964), a newsletter published by the Comic Amateur Press Alliance, and again in an article in Bill Spicer's magazine Fantasy Illustrated #5 (Spring 1966).[30] Kyle, inspired by European and East Asian graphic albums (especially the Japanese manga), used the label to designate comics of an artistically \\"serious\\" sort.[31] Following this, Spicer, with Kyle's acknowledgment, edited and published a periodical titled Graphic Story Magazine in the fall of 1967.[30] The Sinister House of Secret Love #2 (Jan. 1972), one of DC Comics' line of extra-length, 48-page comics, specifically used the phrase \\"a graphic novel of Gothic terror\\" on its cover.[32]\\r\\nIn response to criticism regarding the content of comic books, and to the establishment of the industry's self-censorship Comics Code Authority, an underground alternative comix movement was created.[33]\\r\\nThe term \\"graphic novel\\" began to grow in popularity months after it appeared on the cover of the trade paperback edition (though not the hardcover edition) of Will Eisner's A Contract with God and Other Tenement Stories (October 1978). This collection of short stories was a mature, complex work focusing on the lives of ordinary people in the real world based on Eisner's own experiences.[34] The term \\"graphic novel\\" was intended[citation needed] to distinguish it from the traditional serialized nature of comic books, with which it shared a storytelling medium.\\r\\nOne scholar used graphic novels to introduce the concept of graphiation, a newly coined term used to describe graphic expression or visual enunciation. Graphiation refers to the theory that the entire personality of an artist is visible through his or her visual representation of a certain character, setting, event, or object in a novel, and as a means to examine and analyze drawing style.[35]\\r\\nEven though Eisners A Contract with God was finally published in 1978 by a smaller company, Baronet Press, it took Eisner over a year to find a publishing house that would allow his work to reach the mass market.[36] Eisner cited[citation needed] Lynd Ward's 1930s woodcuts (see above) as an inspiration.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe critical and commercial success of A Contract with God helped to establish the term \\"graphic novel\\" in common usage, and many sources have incorrectly credited Eisner with being the first to use it. These included the Time magazine website in 2003, which said in its correction, \\"Eisner acknowledges that the term 'graphic novel' had been coined prior to his book. But, he says, 'I had not known at the time that someone had used that term before.' Nor does he take credit for creating the first graphic book.\\"[37]\\r\\nOne of the earliest contemporaneous applications of the term post-Eisner came in 1979[citation needed], when Blackmark's sequelpublished a year after A Contract with God though written and drawn in the early 1970swas labeled a \\"graphic novel\\" on the cover of Marvel Comics' black-and-white comics magazine Marvel Preview #17 (Winter 1979), where Blackmark: The Mind Demons premieredits 117-page contents intact, but its panel-layout reconfigured to fit 62 pages.[citation needed]\\r\\nFollowing this, Marvel from 1982 to 1988 published the Marvel Graphic Novel line of 10\\"x7\\" trade paperbacksalthough numbering them like comic books, from #1 (Jim Starlin's The Death of Captain Marvel) to #35 (Dennis O'Neil, Mike Kaluta, and Russ Heath's Hitler's Astrologer, starring the radio and pulp fiction character the Shadow, and released in hardcover). Marvel commissioned original graphic novels from such creators as John Byrne, J. M. DeMatteis, Steve Gerber, graphic-novel pioneer McGregor, Frank Miller, Bill Sienkiewicz, Walt Simonson, Charles Vess, and Bernie Wrightson. While most of these starred Marvel superheroes, others, such as Rick Veitch's Heartburst featured original SF/fantasy characters; others still, such as John J. Muth's Dracula, featured adaptations of literary stories or characters; and one, Sam Glanzman's A Sailor's Story, was a true-life, World War II naval tale.[citation needed]\\r\\nCartoonist Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus (1986), helped establish both the term and the concept of graphic novels in the minds of the mainstream public.[33] Two DC Comics book reprints of self-contained miniseries did likewise, though they were not originally published as graphic novels: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (1986), a collection of Frank Miller's four-part comic-book series featuring an older Batman faced with the problems of a dystopian future; and Watchmen (1986-1987), a collection of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 12-issue limited series in which Moore notes he \\"set out to explore, amongst other things, the dynamics of power in a post-Hiroshima world\\".[38] These works and others were reviewed in newspapers and magazines, leading to increased coverage.[39] Sales of graphic novels increased, with Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, for example, lasting 40 weeks on a UK best-seller list.[40]\\r\\nOutside North America, Eisner's A Contract with God and Spiegelman's Maus led to the popularization of the expression \\"graphic novel\\" as well.[41] Until then, most European countries used neutral, descriptive terminology that referred to the form of the medium, and not the contents. In Francophone Europe for example, the expression bandes dessines ÿ which literally translates as \\"drawn strips\\" ÿ is used, while the terms stripverhaal (\\"strip story\\") and tegneserie (\\"drawn series\\") are used by the Dutch/Flemish and Scandinavians respectively.[42] European comics studies scholars have observed that Americans originally used \\"graphic novel\\" to describe everything that deviated from their standard, 32-page comic book format, meaning that all larger-sized, longer Franco-Belgian comic albums, regardless of their contents, fell under the heading.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmerican comic critics occasionally refer to European graphic novels as \\"Eurocomics\\",[43] and attempts were made in the late 1980s to cross-fertilize the American market with these works. American publishers Catalan Communications and NBM Publishing released translated titles, predominantly from the backlog catalogs of Casterman and Les Humano?des Associs.\\r\\nSome in the comics community have objected to the term \\"graphic novel\\" on the grounds that it is unnecessary, or that its usage has been corrupted by commercial interests. Writer Alan Moore believes,\\r\\nIt's a marketing term... that I never had any sympathy with. The term 'comic' does just as well for me... The problem is that 'graphic novel' just came to mean 'expensive comic book' and so what you'd get is people like DC Comics or Marvel Comicsbecause 'graphic novels' were getting some attention, they'd stick six issues of whatever worthless piece of crap they happened to be publishing lately under a glossy cover and call it The She-Hulk Graphic Novel....\\"[44]\\r\\nIt's a perfect time to retire terms like \\"graphic novel\\" and \\"sequential art,\\" which piggyback on the language of other, wholly separate mediums. What's more, both terms have their roots in the need to dissemble and justify, thus both exude a sense of desperation, a gnawing hunger to be accepted.[45]\\r\\nAuthor Daniel Raeburn wrote, \\"I snicker at the neologism first for its insecure pretensionthe literary equivalent of calling a garbage man a 'sanitation engineer'and second because a 'graphic novel' is in fact the very thing it is ashamed to admit: a comic book, rather than a comic pamphlet or comic magazine.\\"[46] Writer Neil Gaiman, responding to a claim that he does not write comic books but graphic novels, said the commenter \\"meant it as a compliment, I suppose. But all of a sudden I felt like someone who'd been informed that she wasn't actually a hooker; that in fact she was a lady of the evening.\\"[47] Responding to writer Douglas Wolk's quip that the difference between a graphic novel and a comic book is \\"the binding\\", Bone creator Jeff Smith said, \\"I kind of like that answer. Because 'graphic novel'... I don't like that name. It's trying too hard. It is a comic book. But there is a difference. And the difference is, a graphic novel is a novel in the sense that there is a beginning, a middle and an end.\\"[48] The Times writer Giles Coren said, \\"To call them graphic novels is to presume that the novel is in some way higher than the karmicbwurk (comic book), and that only by being thought of as a sort of novel can it be understood as an art form.\\"[49]\\r\\nSome alternative cartoonists have coined their own terms to describe extended comics narratives. The cover of Daniel Clowes' Ice Haven (2001) describes the book as \\"a comic-strip novel\\", with Clowes having noted that he \\"never saw anything wrong with the comic book\\".[50] The cover of Craig Thompson's Blankets calls it \\"an illustrated novel.\\"[citation needed]","input":"What is the definition of a graphic novel?"},{"output":"0.08 percent","context":"A person must be at least be 21 years of age to publicly drink an alcoholic beverage in Texas, with some exceptions[1]\\r\\nTexas is one of ten states (California, Colorado, Maryland, Montana, New York, Texas, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that allow consumption by minors in the presence of consenting and supervising family members.

RNAP locally opens the double-stranded DNA (usually about four turns of the double helix) so that one strand of the exposed nucleotides can be used as a template for the synthesis of RNA, a process called transcription. A transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a DNA binding site called a promoter region before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP has intrinsic helicase activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind the DNA (in contrast to DNA polymerase). RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides.\\r\\nRNAP produces RNA that functionally is either coding (for protein) (messenger RNA) (mRNA); or non-coding: so-called \\"RNA genes\\". At least four functional types of RNA genes exist: Transfer RNA (tRNA) - transfers specific amino acids to growing polypeptide chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation; Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) - is a component of ribosomes; micro RNA (miRNA) - regulates gene activity; and catalytic RNA (Ribozyme)) - an enzymatically active RNA molecule.\\r\\nEukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. All are structurally and mechanistically related to each other and to bacterial RNAP. RNA polymerase I synthesizes a pre-rRNA 45S (35S in yeast). which matures and will form the major RNA sections of the ribosome. RNA polymerase II synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most snRNA and microRNAs.RNA polymerase III synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other small RNAs found in the nucleus and cytosol. RNA polymerase IV synthesizes siRNA in plants. RNA polymerase V synthesizes RNAs involved in siRNA-directed heterochromatin formation in plants. Eukaryotic chloroplasts contain an RNAP very highly structurally and mechanistically similar to bacterial RNAP (\\"plastid-encoded polymerase\\"). They also contain a second, structurally and mechanistically unrelated, RNAP (\\"nucleus-encoded polymerase\\"; member of the \\"single-subunit RNAP\\" protein family). Eukaryotic mitochondria contain a structurally and mechanistically unrelated RNAP (member of the \\"single-subunit RNAP\\" protein family).\\r\\nGiven that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related, but they are not. They seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells: one lineage led to the modern DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases, as well as to a few single-subunit RNA polymerases from viruses; the other lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Roger D. Kornberg for creating detailed molecular images of RNA polymerase during various stages of the transcription process.[1] In most prokaryotes, a single RNA polymerase species transcribes all types of RNA. RNA polymerase from E. coli consists of five different subunit types. The beta () subunit has a molecular weight of 150,000, beta prime (ǡ) 160,000, alpha (ϫ) 40,000, and sigma () 70,000. The  subunit can dissociate from the rest of the complex, leaving the core enzyme. The complete enzyme with  is termed the RNA polymerase holoenzyme and is necessary for correct initiation of transcription, whereas the core enzyme can continue transcription after initiation.[2]\\r\\nControl of the process of gene transcription affects patterns of gene expression and, thereby, allows a cell to adapt to a changing environment, perform specialized roles within an organism, and maintain basic metabolic processes necessary for survival. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In Escherichia coli bacteria, more than 100 transcription factors have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.[3]\\r\\nRNAP can initiate transcription at specific DNA sequences known as promoters. It then produces an RNA chain, which is complementary to the template DNA strand. The process of adding nucleotides to the RNA strand is known as elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides (the full length of the dystrophin gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded at the end of genes, which are known as terminators.\\r\\nProducts of RNAP include:\\r\\nRNAP accomplishes de novo synthesis. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to DNA polymerase, RNAP includes helicase activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.\\r\\nRNA polymerase binding in bacteria involves the sigma factor recognizing the core promoter region containing the -35 and -10 elements (located before the beginning of sequence to be transcribed) and also, at some promoters, the ϫ subunit C-terminal domain recognizing promoter upstream elements.[clarification needed] There are multiple interchangeable sigma factors, each of which recognizes a distinct set of promoters. For example, in E. coli, 70 is expressed under normal conditions and recognizes promoters for genes required under normal conditions (\\"housekeeping genes\\"), while 32 recognizes promoters for genes required at high temperatures (\\"heat-shock genes\\").\\r\\nAfter binding to the DNA, the RNA polymerase switches from a closed complex to an open complex. This change involves the separation of the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the transcription bubble. Ribonucleotides are base-paired to the template DNA strand, according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions. Supercoiling plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA. Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils. Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.\\r\\nAs noted above, RNA polymerase makes contacts with the promoter region. However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. Once the open complex is stabilized, RNA polymerase synthesizes an RNA strand to establish a DNA-RNA heteroduplex (~8-9 bp) at the active center, which stabilizes the elongation complex. In order to accomplish RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, \\"scrunching\\" more downstream DNA into the initiation complex. During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a \\"stressed intermediate.\\" Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough, RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. However, promoter escape is not the only outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription. The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. Scientists have coined the term \\"abortive initiation\\" to explain the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition. The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.\\r\\nTranscription elongation involves the further addition of ribonucleotides and the change of the open complex to the transcriptional complex. RNAP cannot start forming full length transcripts because of its strong binding to the promoter. Transcription at this stage primarily results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in a process known as abortive transcription. Once the RNAP starts forming longer transcripts it clears the promoter. At this point, the contacts with the -10 and -35 elements are disrupted, and the  factor falls off RNAP. This allows the rest of the RNAP complex to move forward, as the  factor held the RNAP complex in place.\\r\\nThe 17-bp transcriptional complex has an 8-bp DNA-RNA hybrid, that is, 8 base-pairs involve the RNA transcript bound to the DNA template strand. As transcription progresses, ribonucleotides are added to the 3' end of the RNA transcript and the RNAP complex moves along the DNA.\\r\\nAspartyl (asp) residues in the RNAP will hold on to Mg2+ ions, which will, in turn, coordinate the phosphates of the ribonucleotides. The first Mg2+ will hold on to the ϫ-phosphate of the NTP to be added. This allows the nucleophilic attack of the 3'OH from the RNA transcript, adding another NTP to the chain. The second Mg2+ will hold on to the pyrophosphate of the NTP. The overall reaction equation is:\\r\\n(NMP)n + NTP --> (NMP)n+1 + PPi\\r\\nUnlike the proofreading mechanisms of DNA polymerase those of the RNA variety have only recently been investigated. Proofreading begins with separation of the mis-incorporated nucleotide from the DNA template. This pauses transcription. The polymerase then backtracks by one position and cleaves the dinucleotide that contains the mismatched nucleotide. In the RNA polymerase this occurs at the same active site used for polymerization and is therefore markedly different from the DNA polymerase where proofreading occurs at a distinct nuclease active site.[4]\\r\\nIn prokaryotes, termination of RNA transcription can be rho-independent or rho-dependent:\\r\\nRho-independent transcription termination is the termination of transcription without the aid of the rho protein. Transcription of a palindromic region of DNA causes the formation of a \\"hairpin\\" structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself. This hairpin structure is often rich in G-C base-pairs, making it more stable than the DNA-RNA hybrid itself. As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid. These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.\\r\\nIn bacteria, the same enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of mRNA and non-coding RNA (ncRNA).\\r\\nRNAP is a large molecule. The core enzyme has five subunits (~400 kDa):[5]\\r\\nIn order to bind promoters, RNAP core associates with the transcription initiation factor sigma () to form RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Sigma reduces the affinity of RNAP for nonspecific DNA while increasing specificity for promoters, allowing transcription to initiate at correct sites. The complete holoenzyme therefore has 6 subunits: 'ϫI and ϫII߿ (~450 kDa).\\r\\nEukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. All are structurally and mechanistically related to each other and to bacterial RNAP:\\r\\nEukaryotic chloroplasts contain an RNAP very highly structurally and mechanistically similar to bacterial RNAP (\\"plastid-encoded polymerase\\").\\r\\nEukaryotic chloroplasts also contain a second, structurally and mechanistically unrelated, RNAP (\\"nucleus-encoded polymerase\\"; member of the \\"single-subunit RNAP\\" protein family).\\r\\nEukaryotic mitochondria contain a structurally and mechanistically unrelated RNAP (member of the \\"single-subunit RNAP\\" protein family).\\r\\nGiven that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related. However, x-ray crystallographic studies of both types of enzymes reveal that, other than containing a critical Mg2+ ion at the catalytic site, they are virtually unrelated to each other; indeed template-dependent nucleotide polymerizing enzymes seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells. One lineage led to the modern DNA Polymerases and reverse transcriptases, as well as to a few single-subunit RNA polymerases from viruses. The other lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases.\\r\\nArchaea have a single type of RNAP, responsible for the synthesis of all RNA. Archaeal RNAP is structurally and mechanistically similar to bacterial RNAP and eukaryotic nuclear RNAP I-V, and is especially closely structurally and mechanistically related to eukaryotic nuclear RNAP II.[13][14] The history of the discovery of the archaeal RNA polymerase is quite recent. The first analysis of the RNAP of an archaeon was performed in 1971, when the RNAP from the extreme halophile Halobacterium cutirubrum was isolated and purified.[15] Crystal structures of RNAPs from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus shibatae set the total number of identified archaeal subunits at thirteen.[13][16]\\r\\nOrthopoxviruses synthesize RNA using a virally encoded RNAP that is structurally and mechanistically related to bacterial RNAP, archaeal RNAP, and eukaryotic nuclear RNAP I-V. Most other viruses that synthesize RNA using a virally encoded RNAP use an RNAP that is not structurally and mechanistically related to bacterial RNAP, archaeal RNAP, and eukaryotic nuclear RNAP I-V. Many viruses use a single-subunit DNA-dependent RNAP that is structurally and mechanistically related to the single-subunit RNAP of eukaryotic chloroplasts and mitochondria and, more distantly, to DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases. Perhaps the most widely studied such single-subunit RNAP is bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Other viruses use a RNA-dependent RNAP (an RNAP that employs RNA as a template instead of DNA). This occurs in negative strand RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses, both of which exist for a portion of their life cycle as double-stranded RNA. However, some positive strand RNA viruses, such as poliovirus, also contain RNA-dependent RNAP.[17]\\r\\nRNAP was discovered independently by Charles Loe, Audrey Stevens, and Jerard Hurwitz in 1960.[18] By this time, one half of the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine had been awarded to Severo Ochoa for the discovery of what was believed to be RNAP,[19] but instead turned out to be polynucleotide phosphorylase.\\r\\nRNA polymerase can be isolated in the following ways:\\r\\nAnd also combinations of the above techniques.","input":"What role does rna polymerase play in transcription?"},{"output":"bolt action rifles","context":"World War I weapons included types standardised and improved over the preceding period, together with some newly developed types using innovative technology and a number of improvised weapons used in trench warfare. Military technology of the time included important innovations in grenades, poison gas, and artillery, along with essentially new weapons such as the submarine, warplane and tank.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInfantry weapons for major powers were mainly bolt action rifles, capable of firing ten or more rounds per minute. German soldiers carried 7.92 Mauser rifles, which were good for penetration. The British carried the famous LeeÿEnfield rifle.[2] Rifles with telescopic sights were used by snipers, and were first used by the Germans.[3]\\r\\nMachine guns were also used by large powers; a favorite was the Maxim gun, a fully automatic weapon, with a high volume of concentrated fire, and its French counterpart, the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun.[4] Their use in defense, combined with barbed wire obstacles, converted the expected mobile battlefield to a static one. The machine gun was useful in stationary battle but was not practical for easy movement through battlefields, and was therefore often dragged or disarmed and carried.\\r\\nNear the end of the war, both sides deployed more mobile light machine guns and submachine guns, such as the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle and Bergmann MP 18.\\r\\nGrenades proved to be effective weapons in the trenches but when the forces arrived their numbers and capabilities were inadequate. Hand grenades were used and improved throughout the war. Contact fuzes became less common, replaced by time fuzes.\\r\\nThe British entered the war with the long-handled impact detonating \\"Grenade, Hand No 1\\".[5] The No. 15 \\"Ball Grenade\\" partially overcame its inadequacies. British forces however mainly used an improvised hand explosive that was at times more difficult to use, yet still useful in battle. This was the Double Cylinder \\"jam tin\\" which consisted of a tin filled with dynamite or guncotton, packed round with scrap metal or stones. To ignite, at the top of the tin there was a Bickford safety fuse connecting the detonator, which was lit by either a cigar, or a second person.[5] The \\"Mills bomb\\" (Grenade, Hand No. 5\\") was invented during the war and came into use in 1915. Its improved fusing system killed more of the enemy and fewer of its users. The French meanwhile introduced the F1 defensive grenade.\\r\\nThe major grenades used in the beginning by the German Army were the impact-detonating \\"discus\\" or \\"oyster shell\\" bomb and the Mod 1913 black powder kugelhandgranate with a friction-ignited time fuse.[5] During the war Germany developed the much more effective Model 24 grenade or \\"potato masher\\" whose variants remained in use for decades.\\r\\nHand grenades were not the only attempt at projectile explosives for infantry. A rifle grenade was brought into the trenches to attack the enemy from a greater distance. The Hales rifle grenade got little attention from the British Army before the war began but, during the war, Germany showed great interest in this weapon. The resulting casualties for the Allies caused Britain to search for a new defense.[6]\\r\\nThe Stokes mortar, a lightweight and very portable trench mortar with short tube and capable of indirect fire, was rapidly developed and widely imitated.[7] Mechanical bomb throwers of lesser range were used in a similar fashion to fire upon the enemy from a safe distance within the trench.\\r\\nThe Sauterelle was a grenade launching Crossbow used before the Stokes morter by French and British troops.\\r\\nThe British and German armies had already changed from red coat (British army) (1902) or Prussian blue (1910) for field uniforms, to less conspicuous khaki or field gray. Adolphe Messimy, Joseph Gallieni and other French leaders had proposed following suit, but the French army marched to war in their traditional red trousers, and only began receiving the new \\"horizon blue\\" ones in 1915.\\r\\nA type of raincoat for British officers, introduced long before the war, gained fame as the trench coat.\\r\\nThe principal armies entered the war with mainly cloth caps or leather helmets. They hastened to develop new steel helmets, in designs that became icons of their respective countries.\\r\\nChemical weapons were first used systematically in this war. Chemical weapons in World War I included phosgene, tear gas, chlorarsines and mustard gas. A secret report by Lt Colonel C. G. Douglas, on the physiological effects of chemical weapons, stated that \\"the particular value of the poison [mustard gas] is to be found in its remarkable casualty producing power as opposed to its killing power\\". The report said that 1% of British troops died due to chemical weapons, while an estimated 181,000 soldiers were victims of gas casualties.[8] Chlorine gas was first used by Germany, in the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, with great effect.[9]\\r\\nChemical weapons were easily attained, and cheap. Gas was especially effective against troops in trenches and bunkers that protected them from other weapons. Studies show[citation needed] that over 1,300,000 people were exposed and intoxicated by gas during the First World War, and 90,000 were killed due to gasses.\\r\\nChemical weapons attacked an individuals respiratory system. The concept of choking easily caused fear in soldiers and the resulting terror affected them psychologically. Because there was such a great fear of chemical weapons amongst the soldiers it wasnt uncommon that a soldier would panic and misinterpret symptoms of the common cold as being affected by a poisonous gas.\\r\\nAviation in World War I started with primitive aircraft, primitively used. Technological progress was swift, leading to ground attack, tactical bombing, and highly publicized, deadly dogfights among aircraft equipped with forward-firing, synchronized machine guns from July 1915 onwards. However, these uses made a lesser impact on the war than more mundane roles in intelligence, sea patrol and especially artillery spotting. Antiaircraft warfare also had its beginnings in this war.\\r\\nGerman strategic bombing during World War I struck Warsaw, Paris, London and other cities. With the small loads carried by Zeppelins and the first, primitive bombers developed specifically for the purpose, direct damage was slight. Large efforts, however, were diverted from more fruitful military activities to the defense of cities. The Allies made much smaller efforts in bombing the Central Powers.\\r\\nIn the 19th century, Britain and France exploited the rapid technical developments in artillery to serve a War of Movement. Such weapons served well in the colonial wars of that century, and served Germany very well in the Franco-Prussian War, but trench warfare was more like a siege, and called for siege guns. The German army had already anticipated that a European war might require heavier artillery, hence had a more appropriate mix of sizes. Foundries responded to the actual situation with more heavy products and fewer highly mobile pieces. Germany developed the Paris guns of stupendous size and range. However, the necessarily stupendous muzzle velocity wore out a gun barrel after a few shots requiring a return to the factory for relining, so these weapons served more to frighten and anger urban people than to kill them or devastate their cities.\\r\\nField artillery entered the war with the idea that each gun should be accompanied by hundreds of shells, and armories ought to have about a thousand on hand for resupply. This proved utterly inadequate when it became commonplace for a gun to sit in one place and fire a hundred shells or more per day for weeks or months on end. To meet the resulting Shell Crisis of 1915, factories were hastily converted from other purposes to make more ammunition. Railways to the front were expanded or built, leaving the question of the last mile. Horses in World War I were the main answer, and their high death rate seriously weakened the Central Powers late in the war. In many places the newly invented trench railways helped. The new motor trucks as yet lacked pneumatic tires, versatile suspension, and other improvements that in later decades would allow them to perform well.\\r\\nThe British Royal Navy and French industrialists invented tanks in World War I. After initial small-scale use they brought success in the opening assault of the Battle of Cambrai (1917) until German artillerymen learned to resist them. Despite rapidly increasing French production, their numbers remained too small to make more than a modest impact on the progress of the war in 1918. Germany used a few captured enemy tanks, and made a few. Plan 1919 outlined the future use of massive tank formations in great offensives combined with ground attack aircraft.\\r\\nPre-war decades had seen great technical improvements in warships, as exemplified by the Dreadnought. German ambitions brought an Anglo-German naval arms race in which the Imperial German Navy was built up from a small force to the world's most modern and second most powerful. The 1916 Battle of Jutland demonstrated the excellence of German ships and crews, but also showed that the High Seas Fleet was not big enough to challenge openly the British blockade of Germany.\\r\\nSubmarines and their armament had similarly improved, but few were in service. Germany had already increased production, and quickly built up its U-boat fleet, both for action against British warships and for a counterblockade of the British Isles. 360 were eventually built. The resulting U-boat Campaign (World War I) destroyed more enemy warships than the High Seas Fleet had, and hampered British war supplies as the more expensive surface fleet had not. However, the submarines soon came under persecution by submarine chasers and other small warships using hastily devised anti-submarine weapons. They could not impose an effective blockade while acting under the restrictions of the prize rules and international law of the sea. They resorted to unrestricted submarine warfare, which cost Germany public sympathy in neutral countries and was a factor contributing to the American entry into World War I.\\r\\nNaval mines were deployed in hundreds of thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. Influence mines were a new development but moored contact mines were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the North Sea Mine Barrage to help bottle the Germans into the North Sea, but it was too late to make much difference.\\r\\nE. Jones, B. Everitt, S.

Two former prime ministersSir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowellserved in the 1890s while members of the Senate.[11] Both, in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate, succeeded prime ministers who had died in officeJohn A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894. That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario.\\r\\nPrime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible. For example, William Lyon Mackenzie King, after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election (that his party won), briefly \\"governed from the hallway\\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power. Turner was the last serving prime minister to not hold a commons seat.\\r\\nShould a serving prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature, or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat, the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by-election.[11] A safe seat is usually chosen; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party's new leader in the by-election, the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention. However, if the governing party selects a new leader shortly before an election is due, and that new leader is not a member of the legislature, he or she will normally await the upcoming election before running for a seat in parliament.\\r\\nIn a poll conducted by Ipsos-Reid following the first prorogation of the 40th parliament on December 4, 2008, it was found that 51% of the sample group thought the prime minister was directly elected by Canadians.[12][13]\\r\\nThe Canadian prime minister serves at Her Majesty's pleasure, meaning the post does not have a fixed term. Once appointed and sworn in by the governor general, the prime minister remains in office until he or she resigns, is dismissed, or dies.[14] The lifespan of parliament was limited by the constitution to five years and, though the governor general may still, on the advice of the prime minister, dissolve parliament and issue the writs of election prior to the date mandated by the Canada Elections Act; the KingÿByng Affair was the only time since Confederation that the governor general deemed it necessary to refuse his prime minister's request for a general vote. As of 2007, with an amendment to the Elections Act, Section 56.1(2) was changed to limit the term of a majority government to four (4) years, with election day being set as the third Monday in October of the 4th calendar year after the previous polling date. [15]\\r\\nFollowing parliamentary dissolution, the prime minister must run in the resulting general election if he or she wishes to maintain a seat in the House of Commons. Should the prime minister's party subsequently win a majority of seats in the House of Commons, it is unnecessary to re-appoint the prime minister or again swear him or her into office.[14] If, however, an opposition party wins a majority of seats, the prime minister may resign or be dismissed by the governor general. Should the prime minister's party achieve a minority while an opposition party wins a plurality (i.e., more seats than any other party but less than a majority), the prime minister can attempt to maintain the confidence of the House by forming a coalition with other minority parties. This option was last entertained in 1925.\\r\\nBecause the prime minister is, in practice, the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government, he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada's head of state,[n 2] when, in fact, that post is held by the Canadian monarch, represented by the governor general.[16] The prime minister is, instead, the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers,[3] which are governed by the constitution and its conventions. However, the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power. Today, as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy, the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding, meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general, leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions.[17] As such, the prime minister, supported by the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO), controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada's system of governance, including the governor general, the Cabinet, justices of the Supreme Court, senators, heads of crown corporations, ambassadors to foreign countries, the provincial lieutenant governors, and approximately 3,100 other positions. Further, the prime minister plays a prominent role in the legislative processwith the majority of bills put before parliament originating in the Cabinetand the leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces.\\r\\nPierre Trudeau is credited with, throughout his tenure as prime minister between 1968 and 1984, consolidating power in the PMO,[18] which is itself filled by political and administrative staff selected at the prime minister's discretion and unaccountable to parliament. At the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, analystssuch as Jeffrey Simpson,[19] Donald Savoie, Andrew Coyne,[20] and John Gomeryargued that both parliament and the Cabinet had become eclipsed by prime ministerial power;[n 3][21] Savoie wrote: \\"The Canadian prime minister has little in the way of institutional check, at least inside government, to inhibit his ability to have his way.\\"[22] Indeed, the position has been described as undergoing a \\"presidentialisation\\",[18][23] to the point that its incumbents publicly outshine the actual head of state (and prime minister's spouses are sometimes called the \\"First Lady of Canada\\"[24][25]).[26][27] Former governor general Adrienne Clarkson alluded to what she saw as \\"an unspoken rivalry\\" that had developed between the prime minister and the Crown.[28] It has been theorized that such is the case in Canada as its parliament is less influential on the executive than in other countries with Westminster parliamentary systems; particularly, Canada has fewer MPs, a higher turnover rate of MPs after each election, and an Americanised system for selecting political party leaders, leaving them accountable to the party membership rather than caucus, as is the case in the United Kingdom.[29]\\r\\nThere do exist checks on the prime minister's power: the commons may revoke its confidence in an incumbent prime minister and Cabinet or caucus revolts can quickly bring down a serving premier and even mere threats of such action can persuade or compel a prime minister to resign his post, as happened with Jean Chrtien. The Reform Act, 2014,[30] codifies the process by which a caucus may trigger a party leadership review and, if necessary, chose an interim leader, thereby making a prime minister more accountable to the MPs in his or her party. Caucuses may choose to follow these rules, though the decision would be made by recorded vote, thereby subjecting the party's choice to public scrutiny.[31]\\r\\nThe Senate may delay or impede legislation put forward by the Cabinet, such as when Brian Mulroney's bill creating the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came before the upper chamber and, given Canada's federal nature, the jurisdiction of the federal government is limited to areas prescribed by the constitution. Further, as executive power is constitutionally vested in the monarch, meaning the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of its ministers,[32][33][34] the sovereign's supremacy over the prime minister in the constitutional order is thus seen as a \\"rebuff to the pretensions of the elected: As it has been said, when the Prime Minister bows before the Queen, he bows before us [the Canadian people].\\"[35][36] Either the sovereign or his or her governor general may therefore oppose the prime minister's will in extreme, crisis situations.[n 4] Near the end of her time as governor general, Adrienne Clarkson stated: \\"My constitutional role has lain in what are called 'reserve powers': making sure that there is a prime minister and a government in place, and exercising the right 'to encourage, to advise, and to warn'[...] Without really revealing any secrets, I can tell you that I have done all three.\\"[37]\\r\\nTwo official residences are provided to the prime minister24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa and Harrington Lake, a country retreat in Gatineau Parkas well an office in the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council (formerly known as Langevin Block), across from Parliament Hill.[38] For transportation, the prime minister is granted an armoured car and shared use of two official aircrafta CC-150 Polaris for international flights and a Challenger 601 for domestic trips. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also furnish constant personal security for the prime minister and his or her family. All of the aforementioned is supplied by the Queen-in-Council through budgets approved by parliament, as is the prime minister's annual salary of CAD$170,400.[1] (A prime minister additionally earns the normal salary of a Member of Parliament: $170,400.[1])\\r\\nShould a serving or former prime minister die, he or she is accorded a state funeral, wherein their casket lies in state in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill.[39] Only Bowell and the Viscount Bennett were given private funerals, Bennett also being the only former Prime Minister of Canada to die and be buried outside the country and Bowell the only whose funeral was not attended by politicians. John Thompson also died outside Canada, at Windsor Castle, where Queen Victoria permitted his lying-in-state before his body was returned to Canada for a state funeral in Halifax.[40]\\r\\nIn earlier years, it was traditional for the monarch to bestow a knighthood on newly appointed Canadian prime ministers. Accordingly, several carried the prefix Sir before their name; of the first eight premiers of Canada, only Alexander Mackenzie refused the honour of a knighthood from Queen Victoria. Following the 1919 Nickle Resolution, however, it was against non-binding policy for the sovereign to grant such honorific titles to Canadians; the last prime minister to be knighted was Sir Robert Borden, who was premier at the time the Nickle Resolution was debated in the House of Commons. Still, Bennett was in 1941, six years after he stepped down as prime minister, elevated to the peerage by King George VI as Viscount Bennett, of Mickleham in the County of Surrey and of Calgary and Hopewell in the Dominion of Canada.[41][42]\\r\\nThe Canadian Heraldic Authority (CHA) has granted former prime ministers an augmentation of honour on the personal coat of arms of those who pursued them. The heraldic badge, referred to by the CHA as the mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada,[43] consists of four red maple leaves joined at the stem on a white field (\\"Argent four maple leaves conjoined in cross at the stem Gules\\"); the augmentation has, so far, been granted either as a canton sinister or centred in the chief.[43][44][45][46][47] To date, former prime ministers Joe Clark,[43] Pierre Trudeau,[44] John Turner,[45] Brian Mulroney,[46] and Kim Campbell were granted arms with the augmentation.[47]\\r\\nCanada continues the Westminster tradition of using the title Prime Minister when one is speaking to the federal head of government directly; this is in contrast to the United States protocol of addressing the federal head of government as mister (as in, Mister President); the Department of Canadian Heritage advises that it is incorrect to use the term Mr Prime Minister.[48] The written form of address for the prime minister should use his or her full parliamentary title: The Right Honourable [name], [post-nominal letters], Prime Minister of Canada. However, while in the House of Commons during Question Period, other members of parliament may address the prime minister as The Right Honourable, Member for [prime minister's riding] or simply The Right Honourable Prime Minister.[49] Former prime ministers retain the prefix The Right Honourable for the remainder of their lives; should they remain sitting MPs, they may be referred as The Right Honourable Member for [member's riding] or by their portfolio title (if appointed to one), as in The Right Honourable Minister of National Defence.\\r\\nIn the decades following Confederation, it was common practice to refer to the prime minister as Premier of Canada,[50][51][52] a custom that continued until the First World War, around the time of Robert Borden's premiership.[53][54][55] While contemporary sources will still speak of early prime ministers of Canada as premier,[56][57][58] the modern practice is such that the federal head of government is known almost exclusively as the prime minister, while the provincial heads of government are termed premiers (save for within Quebec and New Brunswick, where the premiers are addressed in French as Premier ministre du [province], literally translated as Prime Minister of [province]).\\r\\nAfter exiting office, former prime ministers of Canada have engaged in various pursuits. Some remained in politics: Bowell continued to serve as a senator, Stephen Harper returned to the House of Commons as a backbench Member of Parliament, and Bennett moved to the United Kingdom after being elevated to the House of Lords.[59] A number led Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition in the Canadian parliament: John A. Macdonald, Arthur Meighen, Mackenzie King,[60] and Pierre Trudeau, all before being re-appointed as prime minister (Mackenzie King twice); Alexander Mackenzie and John Diefenbaker, both prior to sitting as regular Members of Parliament until their deaths;[61] Wilfrid Laurier dying while still in the post;[62] and Charles Tupper,[63] Louis St. Laurent,[64] and John Turner, each before they returned to private business. Meighen was also appointed to the Senate following his second period as prime minister, but resigned his seat to seek re-election and moved to private enterprise after failing to win a riding.[65] Following Meighen into civilian life were: Robert Borden, who served as Chancellor of Queen's and McGill Universities, as well as working in the financial sector; Lester B. Pearson, who acted as Chancellor of Carleton University;[66] Joe Clark and Kim Campbell, who became university professors, Clark also consultant and Campbell working in international diplomacy and as the director of private companies and chairperson of interest groups; while Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chrtien returned to legal practice.[67] Former prime ministers also commonly penned autobiographiesTupper,[63] for exampleor published their memoirssuch as Diefenbaker and Paul Martin.[61]","input":"Who is the new prime minister of canada?"},{"output":"Mahatma Gandhi","context":"Sevagram (meaning \\"A village for/of service\\") is the name of a village in the state of Maharashtra, India. It was the place of Mohandas Gandhi's (Gandhiji's) ashram and his residence from 1936 to his death in 1948.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSevagram is a small village, located about 8?km from Wardha. Mahatma Gandhi set up his ashram in the outskirts of the village when barely 1,000 people lived there. Seth Jamnalal Bajaj of Wardha, a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, made available to the ashram about 300 acres (1.2?km2) of land. [2] Near the ashram there is a museum where artifacts of India's freedom struggle are preserved.\\r\\nWhen Gandhi started his padayatra (foot march) in 1930 from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi for the Salt Satyagraha, he decided not to return to Sabarmati till India achieved independence. Gandhi was imprisoned for more than two years. On his release he spent sometime travelling around India. He decided to make a village in Central India his headquarters. He came to Wardha in 1934, at the invitation of his follower and industrialist, Jamnalal Bajaj and stayed in one of the rooms at Jamnalal's bungalow (Bajajwadi)[3] at Wardha and in the Prarthana mandir of Mahila Ashram for sometime.[4]\\r\\nIn April 1936, Gandhiji established his residence in a village called Segaon[5] at the outskirts of Wardha, which he renamed as Sevagram, which means 'village of service'. Gandhiji was 67 years old when he came to Sevagram. The small homes which were built in the ashram for Gandhi and Kasturba, and his followers were similar to the typical village homes. The ashram employed some harijans in the common kitchen to break the caste barrier. Vinoba Bhave's Param Dham Ashram is located on the banks of the Dhaam river close by. Many decisions on important national matters and movements were taken at Sevagram. It became the central place for a number of institutions for the nation building activities devised by Gandhiji to suit the inherent strength of this country.\\r\\nSevagram is 8?km from Wardha town in Maharashtra and 75?km from Nagpur. In spite of many practical difficulties, Gandhiji decided to settle here. Though he did not have any intentions of keeping anybody with him except his wife Kasturba, pressure of work necessitated more colleagues with him till Sevagram Ashram became a full-fledged institution. There were no facilities at Sevagram, not even a post or telegraph office. The letters used to be brought from Wardha. There was another village in this region named Shegaon, made famous by the residence of Saint Gajanan Maharaj. So, Gandhiji's letters used to get misdirected. Therefore, it was decided in 1940 to rename this village as Sevagram[6] or 'the village of service'.\\r\\nSevagram railway station is 6?km from the main village. Previously the station was named as Wardha East railway station. There is one of the sharpest railway turns near the station.[citation needed] Sevagram is a station on the Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line. Sevagram is well connected by rail, bus and airport; the closest airport is situated around 55?km away.Also many trains from the north side towards south passes through this route.

It contains a fresco cycle by Giotto, completed about 1305 and considered to be an important masterpiece of Western art. The nave is 20.88 metres long, 8.41 metres wide, and 12.65 metres high. The apse area is composed of a square area (4.49 meters deep and 4.31 meters wide) and a pentagonal area (2.57 meters deep).\\r\\nGiotto and his team covered all the internal surfaces of chapel with frescos, including the walls and the ceiling. The largest element is extensive cycles showing the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin. The wall at the rear of the church, through which the chapel is entered, has a large Last Judgement. There are also panels in grisaille (monochrome) showing the Vices and Virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church was dedicated to Santa Maria della Carit at the Feast of the Annunciation, 1303, and consecrated in 1305. Giotto's fresco cycle focuses on the life of the Virgin Mary and celebrates her role in human salvation. A motet by Marchetto da Padova appears to have been composed for the dedication on 25 March 1305.[1] The chapel is also known as the Arena Chapel because it was built on land purchased by Enrico Scrovegni that abutted the site of a Roman arena. The space was where an open-air procession and sacred representation of the Annunciation to the Virgin had been played out for a generation before the chapel was built.\\r\\nThe Arena Chapel was commissioned from Giotto by the affluent Paduan banker, Enrico Scrovegni. In the early 1300s Enrico purchased from Manfredo Dalesmanini the area on which the Roman arena had stood. Here he had his luxurious palace built, as well as a chapel annexed to it. The chapel's project was twofold: to serve as the family's private oratory and as a funerary monument for himself and his wife. Enrico commissioned Giotto, the famous Florentine painter, to decorate his chapel. Giotto had previously worked for the Franciscan friars in Assisi and Rimini, and had been in Padua for some time, working for the Basilica of Saint Anthony in the Sala del Capitolo and in the Blessings's Chapel.\\r\\nA number of 14th-century sources (Riccobaldo Ferrarese, Francesco da Barberino, 1312-1313) testify to Giotto's presence at the Arena Chapel's site. The fresco cycle can be dated with a good approximation to a series of documentary testimonies: the purchase of the land took place on 6 February 1300; the bishop of Padua, Ottobono dei Razzi, authorised the building some time prior to 1302 (the date of his transferral to the Patriarcato of Aquileia); the chapel was first consecrated on 25 March 1303, the feast day of the Annunciation; on 1 March 1304 Pope Benedict XI granted an indulgence to whoever visited the chapel; one year later on 25 March 1305 the chapel received its definitive consecration. Giotto's work thus falls in the period from 25 March 1303 to 25 March 1305.\\r\\nGiotto, who was born around 1267, was 36ÿ38 years old when he worked at Enrico Scrovegni's chapel. He had a team of about 40 collaborators, and they calculated that 625 work days (giornati) were necessary to paint the chapel. A \\"work day\\" meant that portion of each fresco that could be painted before the plaster dried and was no longer \\"fresh\\" (fresco in Italian ).\\r\\nIn January 1305, friars from the nearby Church of the Eremitani filed a complaint to the bishop, protesting that Scrovegni had not respected the original agreement. Scrovegni was transforming his private oratory into a church with a bell tower, thus producing unfair competition with the Eremitani's activities. We do not know what happened next, but it is likely that, as a consequence of this complaint, the monumental apse and the wide transept were demolished. Both are visible on a model of the church painted by Giotto on the counter-facade (the Last Judgement). The apse was the section where Enrico Scrovegni had meant to have his tomb. The presence of frescoes dating to after 1320 supports the demolition hypothesis proposed by Giuliano Pisani. The apse, the most significant area in all churches, is where Enrico and his wife, Lacopina d'Este, were buried.\\r\\nThis apse presents a narrowing of the space which gives a sense of its being incomplete and inharmonious. When one observes the lower frame of the triumphal arch, right above Saint Catherine of Alexandria's small altar piece, Giotto's perfect symmetry is altered by a fresco decoration representing two medallions with busts of female saints, a lunette with Christ in glory, and two episodes from the Passion (the prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane and the Flagellation of Christ, which together give an overall sense of disharmony. The artist who painted these scenes also painted the greater part of the apse, an unknown artist called \\"The Master of the Scrovegni Choir\\" who worked at the Chapel about twenty years after Giotto's work was completed. The main focus of the unknown artist's work is constituted by six monumental scenes on the side walls of the chancel that depict the last period of Mary's earthly life. This choice is in tune with the iconographic program inspired by Alberto da Padova and painted by Giotto.\\r\\nThe chapel was originally connected with the Scrovegni palace, which was built on what remained of the foundations of the elliptical ancient Roman arena. The palace was demolished in 1827 in order to sell the precious materials it contained and to erect two condominiums in its place. The chapel was purchased by the Municipality of the City of Padua in 1881, a year after the City Council's deliberation of 10 May 1880 leading to a decision to demolish the condominiums and restore the chapel.\\r\\nIn June 2001, following a preparation study lasting over 20 years, the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro (Central Institute for Restoration) of the Ministry for Cultural Activities, in collaboration with Padua's Town Hall in its capacity of owner of the Arena Chapel, started a full-scale restoration of Giotto's frescoes under the late Giuseppe Basile's technical direction. In 2000 the consolidation and restoration of the external surfaces had been completed and the adjacent \\"Corpo Tecnologico Attrezzato\\" (CTA) had been installed. In this \\"equipped technological chamber\\" visitors wait for fifteen minutes to allow their body humidity to be lowered and any accompanying smog dust to be filtered out. In March 2002 the chapel was reopened to the public in its original splendor. A few problems remain unsolved, such as flooding in the crypt under the nave due to the presence of an underlying aquifer, and the negative effect on the building's stability of the cement inserts that replaced the original wooden ones in the 1960s.\\r\\nGiuliano Pisani's studies argued that a number of commonly held beliefs concerning the chapel are groundless, among them, the notion that Dante inspired Giotto. Another claim was that the theological program followed by Giotto is based on St Thomas Aquinas, whereas Pisani claims it to be wholly Augustinian. Pisani also argued against the conjecture that the Frati Gaudenti fraternity, of which Enrico Scrovegni was a member, influenced the content of Giotto's fresco cycle.[2] He also argued against the belief that Enrico Scrovegni required that the iconography program have no emphasis placed on the sin of usury. Giuliano Pisani pointed out that Dante's condemnation of Scrovegni's father, Reginaldo, as a usurer in Canto 17 of the Inferno dates to a few years after Giotto's completion of the chapel, so it cannot be regarded as a motive behind any theological anxieties on the part of Enrico Scrovegni. It must be noted that Pisani's arguments have not yet been widely embraced by the scholarly community, and that debates persist regarding the impetus for the chapel's creation and the reasons behind its design.\\r\\nAccording to Pisani,[3] Giotto painted the chapel's inner surface following a comprehensive iconographic and decorative project devised by the Augustinian theologian, Friar Alberto da Padova. Among the sources utilized by Giotto following Friar Alberto's advice are the Apocryphal Gospels of Pseudo-Matthew and Nicodemus, the Golden Legend (Legenda aurea) by Jacopo da Varazze (Jacobus a Varagine) and, for a few minute iconographic details, Pseudo-Bonaventure's Meditations on the Life of Jesus Christ, as well as a number of Augustinian texts, such as De doctrina Christiana, De libero arbitrio, De Genesi contra Manicheos, De quantitate animae, and other texts from the Medieval Christian tradition, among which is the Phisiologus.[4]\\r\\nMost Giotto scholarship believes that Giotto had made a number of theological mistakes. For instance, Giotto placed Hope after Charity in the Virtues series, and did not include Avarice in the Vices series, due to the usual representation of Enrico Scrovegni as a usurer. Giuliano Pisani asserts that Giotto followed a careful and deliberate theological programme based on Saint Augustine and devised by Friar Alberto da Padova. Avarice, far from being \\"absent\\" in Giotto's cycle, is portrayed with Envy, forming with it a fundamental component of a more comprehensive sin. For this reason Envy is placed facing the virtue of Charity, to indicate that Charity is the exact opposite of Envy, and that in order to cure oneself of the sin of Envy one needs to learn from Charity. Charity crushes Envy's money bag under her feet, while on the opposite wall red flames burn under Envy's feet.[5]\\r\\nGiotto frescoed the chapel's whole surface, including the walls and the ceiling. The fresco cycle is organised along four tiers, each of which contains episodes from the stories of the various protagonists of the Sacred History. Each tier is divided into frames, each forming a scene. The chapel is asymmetrical in shape, with six windows on the longer south wall, and this shape determined the layout of the decoration. The first step was choosing to place two frames between each double window set on the south wall; secondly, the width and height of the tiers was fixed in order to calculate the same space on the opposite north wall.\\r\\nCycles of scenes showing the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin were the grandest form of religious art in the period, and Giotto's cycle is unusually large and comprehensive, showing the ambition of the commission. Allowing for this, the selection and iconography of the scenes is broadly comparable to other contemporary cycles; Giotto's innovation lies in the monumentality of his forms and the clarity of his compositions.\\r\\nThe cycle recounts the story of salvation. It starts from high up on the lunette of the triumphal arch, with the uncommon scene of God the Father instructing the Archangel Gabriel to perform the Annunciation to Mary.[6] The narrative continues with the stories of Joachim and Anne (first tier from the top, south wall) and the stories of Mary (first tier from the top, north wall). After a return to the triumphal arch, the scenes of the Annunciation and the Visitation follow. The stories of Christ were placed on the middle tier of the south and north walls. The scene of Judas receiving the money to betray Jesus is on the triumphal arch. The lower tier of the south and north walls shows the Passion and Resurrection; the last frame on the north wall shows the Pentecost. The fourth tier begins at ground level with the monochromes of the Vices (north wall) and the Virtues (south wall). The west wall (counter-fa?ade) presents the Last Judgment.\\r\\nThe scenes depicted are as follows:\\r\\nSacred stories:\\r\\nTriumphal arch (lunette):\\r\\nUpper tier, south wall:\\r\\nUpper tier, north wall:\\r\\nTriumphal arch:\\r\\nMiddle tier, south wall:\\r\\nMiddle tier, north wall:\\r\\nTriumphal arch:\\r\\nLower tier, south wall:\\r\\nLower tier, north wall;\\r\\nBottom tier, north wall: Vices:\\r\\nBottom tier, south wall: Virtues:\\r\\nCounter-fa?ade:\\r\\nThe vault presents the eighth day, the time of eternity, Gods time, with eight planets (the tondos which enclose the seven great prophets of the Old Testament plus John the Baptist) and two suns (which show God and the Madonna and Child), while the blue sky is studded with eight-point stars (8, sideways, symbolises infinity).\\r\\nThe bottom tiers of the longer walls feature 14 allegories, in monochrome, symbolising Vices on the north wall and Virtues on the south wall. The Vices are Stultitia, Inconstantia, Ira, Iniusticia, Infidelitas, Invidia, and Desperatio. The Virtues are grouped as follows: the four cardinal virtues: Prudentia, Iustitia, Temperantia, Fortitudo, followed by the three theological ones: Fides, Karitas, Spes. Each virtue and vice is embedded within a mirror-like marble frame. The name of the vice or the virtue is written in Latin on top of each figure, indicating what these figures represent, namely, the seventh day (the time between Jesuss birth and the Final Judgement).\\r\\nAccording to the controversial theory of Giuliano Pisani, the Vices and Virtues read starting from the altars side, going towards the counter-fa?ade (Final Judgement), and the sequence is not \\"Vices first, then Virtues\\" as was long believed. It rather proceeds from Vice 1 (Stultitia) (north wall, right hand side) to Virtue 1 (Prudencia) (south wall, left hand side), to Vice 2 (Inconstantia) (north wall) to Virtue 2 (Fortitudo) (south side), and so on. Vices and Virtues symbolise humanitys progress toward bliss (heavenly happiness). With the aid of Virtues, humanity can overcome obstacles (Vices). This is the philosophical-theological itinerary designed by Giottos theologian, a learned theologian who drew his inspiration from Saint Augustin. The Vice-Virtue section of the Arena Chapel illustrates the philosophical-theological message underlying the overall project and is key to clarifying several points previously considered to be either obscure or the result of Giottos only approximate theological knowledge.[7] For instance, in the Arena Chapel the vices are not the traditional capital vices or deadly sins (Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony and Lust), just like the \\"corresponding\\" virtues do not reflect the traditional order, consisting in four \\"cardinal virtues\\" (Prudence, Justice, Fortitude and Temperance) and three \\"theological virtues\\" (Faith, Hope and Charity).\\r\\nA twofold therapeutic path leading to salvation is presented. The first, composed of four virtues, brings a cure by means of the opposing force provided by the cardinal virtues. The arrival point in this first part of the itinerary is Justice, Iusticia, who makes peace possible and therefore ensures Paradise on earth and earthly happiness. The first Vice in this first section is Stultitia, namely the incapacity to distinguish good and evil. Its cure (opposite wall) is Prudencia, Prudence, which in classical and theological terms is not \\"cautiousness\\" but \\"moral intelligence\\" or the capacity to distinguish good and evil. The viewer is in the sphere of Knowledge. Next comes the pair Inconstantia, Inconstancy, (north wall) and Fortitudo, Fortitude, (south wall). Fortitude (moral and mental strength) triumphs over Inconstancys lewd oscillations by means of will. \\"Inconstancy\\" is literally \\"the lack of a stable seat\\"; it is a mix of light-headedness, volubility, and inconsistency. \\"Inconstancy\\" is portrayed as a young woman rolling over a ball, ready to fall, on a motley marble floor signifying the lack of \\"unity\\" (\\"constancy\\") which characterises an inconstant mind. Here is the sphere of Will. Wrath, the third vice, is \\"tempered\\" by Temperantia, Temperance. According to Saint Augustine, Temperantia is the inner balance which ensures the wills stable dominion over instincts and keeps human desires within the boundaries of honesty. It is the therapy necessary to prevail over passions, which are symbolised by Wrath, because Wrath is the most perilous of all the passions: it is sudden and destructive, even against owns dearest ones, and is therefore the passion that human beings first need to learn how to control. This notion is a tenet of ancient Greek and (in its footprints) Roman philosophy, which Saint Augustin made his own and Giottos theologian transmitted to him, fusing together a number of Saint Augustins writings.\\r\\nPrudence, Fortitude and Temperance pertain to each individuals ethical sphere of action and have as their goal the cure of each individual \\"self\\". Ethical virtue takes form in practical application, through action and behaviour that pertain both to the personal and the social sphere and affect human relations. The notions of Justice and Injustice, the central \\"pair\\" in Giottos Arena Chapel, emanate from this notion. Justice perfect centrality is visually emphasized by an architectural \\"die\\", a small cube that runs above each of the various personifications in a slightly slanted way, pointing either toward the apse or the counter-fa?ade, everywhere but above the head of Justice (south wall) and Injustice (north wall), where the small die falls in a perpendicular line, marking at the same time the exact physical half of the chapel as well as Justices curing function from a theological-philosophical viewpoint, without forgetting that Justice is what cures the soul of the sickening effects of Injustice (on the chapels other side).\\r\\nThose who have successfully progressed in their therapeutic path have attained Justice. Those who have not, have attained Injustice. Those who have attained Justice have practiced a souls therapy that can be defined as \\"human\\" and that led them to earthly happiness. They used as their therapy the \\"medicina animi\\", the \\"souls medicine\\" provided by the cardinal virtues (in the sequence Prudence-Fortitude-Temperance-Justice), namely the moral and intellectual virtues with whose \\"medicine\\" human beings can be cured of, and are able to prevail over, the opposing vices.\\r\\nNext come the theological virtues. In order to be able to aspire to heavenly Paradise one needs divine teaching, the revelation of truth, with which one overcomes and transcends human reason, and to practice the theological virtues. The \\"divine therapy\\" begins with the rejection of false beliefs (Infidelitas) through Faith in God (Fides). Only with the \\"medicine\\" of Charity (Karitas) can man overcome Selfishness and Envy (Invidia), which lead him to look with malevolent eyes (Latin in-vidre) at his neighbour, who is also made by God in His likeness. Finally, with the aid (the medicine), Hope (Spes) can be contrasted with Lack of Hope, or Desperation (Desperatio). Hope is an attitude consisting in actively waiting for Gods future blessings which descend from trust in God and in His word, and also consisting in love, through the love of God, of the whole of humankind.\\r\\nThe sources of this extraordinary program were identified by Pisani in a number of passages of Saint Augustines works. Everything finds a perfect correspondence with something else. It is the theme of the \\"therapy of opposites\\", the sequential order of the cardinal and theological virtues, and the centrality of Justice.\\r\\nCoordinates: 452442N 115246E? / ?45.41167N 11.87944E? / 45.41167; 11.87944","input":"Who was commissioned to paint the scrovegni (arena) chapel?"},{"output":"the Speaker or, in his absence, by the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha or in his absence, the Deputy-Chairman of the Rajya Sabha","context":"The Parliament of India is bicameral.

If any of the above officers are not present then any other member of the Parliament can preside by consensus of both the House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per Article 108 of Constitution, a Joint session of Parliament can be summoned in the following situations.[1]\\r\\nIf after a Bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House\\r\\n(a) the Bill is rejected by the other House; or (b) the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be made in the Bill; or (c) more than six months elapse from the date of the reception of the Bill by the other House without the Bill being passed by it, the President may, unless the Bill has elapsed by reason of a dissolution of the House of the People, notify to the Houses by message if they are sitting or by public notification if they are not sitting, his intention to summon them to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the Bill\\r\\nHowever, in calculating period of six months, those days are not considered when house is prorogued or adjourned for more than 4 consecutive days.\\r\\nIf the above conditions are satisfied, the President of India may summon joint sitting of both the houses of parliament.\\r\\nNot all bills can be refereed to a joint sitting of Parliament. There are two exception.\\r\\n1. Money Bill\\r\\nUnder the Constitution of India, money bills require approval of the Lok Sabha only. Rajya Sabha can make recommendations to Lok Sabha, which it is not required to accept. Even if Rajya Sabha doesn't pass a money bill within 14 days, it is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses of Parliament after expiry of the above period. Therefore, a requirement to summon a joint session can never arise in the case of money bill.\\r\\n2. Constitution Amendment Bill\\r\\nArticle 368 of Indian constitution require that constitution of India can be amended by both houses of parliament by 2/3 majority. In case of disagreement between both houses, there is no provision to summon joint session of parliament.\\r\\nJoint session of Indian parliament has been called for only three bills i.e. dowry prohibition act, 1960, banking service commission act, 1977 and POTA, 2002.

They compose two of the three main subcultures of the Sioux /?su?/ people, and are typically divided into the Eastern Dakota and the Western Dakota.\\r\\nThe Eastern Dakota are the Santee (Is?yathi or Is?-athi; \\"knife\\" + \\"encampment\\", dwells at the place of knife flint), who reside in the eastern Dakotas, central Minnesota and northern Iowa. They have federally recognized tribes established in several places.\\r\\nThe Western Dakota are the Yankton, and the Yanktonai (Ih?kt?u?wa? and Ih?kt?u?wa?na; \\"Village-at-the-end\\" and \\"Little village-at-the-end\\"), who reside in the Missouri River area. The Yankton-Yanktonai are collectively also referred to by the endonym Wi?hyena (Those Who Speak Like Men). They also have distinct federally recognized tribes.\\r\\nIn the past the Western Dakota have been erroneously classified as Nakota, a branch of the Sioux who moved further west. The latter are now located in Montana and across the border in Canada, where they are known as Stoney.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Dakota means \\"ally\\" in the Dakota language, and their autonyms include Ik? Wi?h?ta (\\"Indian people\\") and Dakh܇ta Oyte (\\"Dakota people\\").[3]\\r\\nThe Eastern and Western Dakota are two of the three groupings belonging to the Sioux nation (also called Dakota in a broad sense), the third being the Lakota (Tht?u?wa? or Teton). The three groupings speak dialects that are still relatively mutually intelligible. This is referred to as a common language, Dakota-Lakota, or Sioux.[4]\\r\\nThe other two languages of the Dakotan dialect continuum, Assiniboine and Stoney (spoken by the Nakota or Nakoda peoples), have grown widely or completely unintelligible to Dakota and Lakota speakers.[5]\\r\\nThe Dakota include the following bands:\\r\\nThe majority of the Santee live on reservations, reserves, and communities in Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Canada[specify]. However some of those in the north woods of Minnesota remain at the Ottertail Lake and Inspiration Peak areas. They were never sent to reservations as they were protected by settlers whom they had befriended.\\r\\nAfter the Dakota War of 1862, many Santee were sent to Crow Creek Indian Reservation; in 1864 some from the Crow Creek Reservation were sent to the Santee Sioux Reservation.\\r\\nThe Bdewka?thu?wa? (Mdewakanton) live predominantly at the Prairie Island and Shakopee reservations in Minnesota.\\r\\nMost of the Yankton live on the Yankton Indian Reservation in southeastern South Dakota. Some Yankton live on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation and Crow Creek Reservation, which is also occupied by the Lower Yanktonai.\\r\\nThe Upper Yanktonai live in the northern part of Standing Rock Reservation, on the Spirit Lake Reservation in central North Dakota, and in the eastern half of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana. In addition, they reside at several Canadian reserves, including Birdtail, Oak Lake, and Whitecap (formerly Moose Woods).\\r\\nIt's was difficult to say exactly where the Dakota people came from before the recorded era. The closest Siouan-speaking peoples to them were the Chiwere, the oldest existing Siouan language that is more of a proto-Siouan form that predates all the others. Despite this, the Dakota language, Lakotaiapi, is actually very closely related to that of the Dhegihan & Hokan Siouan peoples-- both of whom claim to have come from Ohio from the 13th century back.\\r\\nA single line of older history seems to have survived from the Dakotas-- that they had come to live with the Winnebago, but they soon became angry and ordered them to leave. Combining this with the histories of the Dhegihans, it's possible to assume that the ancestors of the Dakota people may have also been refugees from further east who started taking refuge with other Siouan allies-- possibly even predating the move of the Dhegihan Sioux peoples. It could have either been overcrowding or the disruption the Dhegihans made to commerce and trade along the Mississippi River when they came to the Plains that forced the Winnebago to send the first Dakota off to find a new homeland. This, however, is only a guess. [7]\\r\\nThe Dakota Oyate are said to have lived in Minnesota prior to the 18th century. [3][8] Most of their early history was recorded (haphazardly, at that) by a white man named James Walker close to the end of the 19th century, as he offered aid among the Lakota/ Dakota people. He recorded much of what he knew in three books-- Lakota Myth, Lakota Belief & Ritual & Lakota Society. Seemingly, they were originally one people with one chief who grew and developed four sub-factions over time, each with their own equal chiefs. These two groups also evolved two distinct dialects of their language, Nakota & Dakota. Their capitol was situated at a place known as Ble Wakan, (Boo-reh wah-kaw) which is currently identified as Lake Mille Lac. [9]\\r\\nLate in the 17th century, the Dakota entered into an alliance with French merchants. [10] The French were trying to gain an advantage in the struggle for the North American fur trade against the English, who had recently established the Hudson's Bay Company. While many people believe that the name Sioux derives from an Ojibwe racial slur directed towards them, it is far more likely that the title Sioux came from the early French explorers. They originally named the Mississippi River the direct French translation for the Ojibwe name, \\"Great River,\\" which was Sioux Tango, at least, before the other Ojibwe name for the river, Michi Ziibi, managed to stick. The Dakota were known to be directly related to the source of the River.\\r\\nIt's difficult to say exactly what occurred or why, but close to the end of the 17th century, some sort of war occurred between Siouan and Algonquian peoples between Lake Superior and the Mississippi River. The Dakota were driven away from the River and off onto the plains, where they were forced to wage a long military campaign to displace several lesser known native tribes in the region of North & South Dakota. Also affected in this original war were the Fox/ Menominee people (who moved from the western shore of Lake Superior to the border region of Michigan & Wisconsin), the Winnebago & the Illinois Confederacy (who broke and were moved across the Mississippi River by the French). Displaced, local Algonquian, Caddoan, Chiwere & Dhegihan peoples already on the Plains fought back fiercely for decades before everything settled. Many tribes were completely, or nearly, wiped out during this time.\\r\\nSeemingly, after this there was a split among the Dakota people and two new groups-- the Hohe & the Lakota-- split off from them. While they originally operated as their own separate nations, it appears that they eventually merged back together to form the Oceti Sakowin, Seven Fire Council, by the early-mid 19th century. [11] The Hohe returned to Minnesota, where they earned the nickname Asinii Bwaan, or Stone Sioux, from the Ojibwe. [12] To this day, the Hohe are primarily known as the Assiniboine. Many of those who left were part of the Nakota and, due to this, they lost military superiority among their people to the Dakota Santee Sioux. It was roughly around this point that all these peoples began to generally refer to themselves as the Dakota People. [13] After their far later defeat by the United States, the Nakota would dissolve and merge with the Lakota & Dakota and the Dakota would shrink. Only the smallest of the four groups, the Lakota, managed to thrive and grow in captivity. Despite this, all four dialects of the Lakotaiapi language managed to survive to modern day.\\r\\nAccording to Lakota Society, the names of the seven tribes seem to have been divided as such:\\r\\nBy 1862, shortly after a failed crop the year before and a winter starvation, the federal payment was late. The local traders would not issue any more credit to the Santee and one trader, Andrew Myrick, went so far as to say, \\"If they're hungry, let them eat grass.\\"[14] On August 17, 1862, the Dakota War began when a few Santee men murdered a white farmer and most of his family. They inspired further attacks on white settlements along the Minnesota River. The Santee attacked the trading post. Later settlers found Myrick among the dead with his mouth stuffed full of grass.[15]\\r\\nOn November 5, 1862 in Minnesota, in courts-martial, 303 Santee Dakota were found guilty of rape and murder of hundreds of American settlers. They were sentenced to be hanged. No attorneys or witness were allowed as a defense for the accused, and many were convicted in less than five minutes of court time with the judge.[16] President Abraham Lincoln commuted the death sentence of 284 of the warriors, while signing off on the execution of 38 Santee men by hanging on December 26, 1862 in Mankato, Minnesota. Forty-three-year-old Alexander Wilkin commanded the executions, which together amounted to the largest single mass execution in U.S. history.[17]\\r\\nAfterwards, the US suspended treaty annuities to the Dakota for four years and awarded the money to the white victims and their families. The men remanded by order of President Lincoln were sent to a prison in Iowa, where more than half died.[16]\\r\\nDuring and after the revolt, many Santee and their kin fled Minnesota and Eastern Dakota to Canada, or settled in the James River Valley in a short-lived reservation before being forced to move to Crow Creek Reservation on the east bank of the Missouri.[16] A few joined the Yanktonai and moved further west to join with the Lakota bands to continue their struggle against the United States military.[16]\\r\\nOthers were able to remain in Minnesota and the east, in small reservations existing into the 21st century, including Sisseton-Wahpeton, Flandreau, and Devils Lake (Spirit Lake or Fort Totten) Reservations in the Dakotas. Some ended up in Nebraska, where the Santee Sioux Tribe today has a reservation on the south bank of the Missouri.\\r\\nThose who fled to Canada now have descendants residing on nine small Dakota Reserves, five of which are located in Manitoba (Sioux Valley, Dakota Plains, Dakota Tipi, Birdtail Creek, and Oak Lake [Pipestone]) and the remaining four (Standing Buffalo, Moose Woods [White Cap], Round Plain [Wahpeton], and Wood Mountain) in Saskatchewan.\\r\\nIn Minnesota, the treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 left the Dakota with a reservation 20 miles (32?km) wide on each side of the Minnesota River.\\r\\nIn Canada, the Canadian government recognizes the tribal community as First Nations. The land holdings of these First Nations are called Indian Reserves.\\r\\n(Formerly Devil's Lake Reservation)\\r\\n(Mni Wakan Oyate)\\r\\n(Pejuhutazizi Oyate)\\r\\n(Formerly Prior Lake Indian Reservation)\\r\\n(* Reserves shared with other First Nations)\\r\\nHints from legends claim that they were originally more settled and did farm corn, earth beans & pumpkins in their original homeland. They also harvested local plants, such as Tipsila (a wild North American turnip), American Wild Rice, Various types of nuts & berries & some form of wild potato & hunted animals like the Buffalo, whom the native people always held in high regard. As per the rumors, they always tried to use every part of the Buffalo and never be wasteful. Their homes would have still been tipis, or something alike a tipi that was more permanent. Technically, these homes are called Ti, or Oti. Tipi would be plural. [19]\\r\\nAfter being driven onto the plains, life was harder. The people were unable to farm the land and took to yearly migration cycles, following the Buffalo closely. Despite having separate homelands, the migrations would often take certain groups into the territories of one another. This made acquiring things like corn and Tobacco extremely difficult. Tobacco, usually used as incense for holy ceremonies and habitually smoked, had to be reserved for very special occasions & was often replaced by the abundant sweet grass found on the Plains. Many of their ceremonies, such as one holiday that took place during the first planting season, no longer held any relevance and the culture diverged from its original form greatly. Hope did come, however, with the horse. The Lakota managed to win a major conflict with the Cheyenne and got horses in the deal. This revelation made many aspects of life far easier and all the Dakota people quickly evolved into a horse-riding culture. Their word for horse is Sunkawakan, or Holy Dog.\\r\\nEach of the seven tribes were said to have been divided into smaller and smaller subgroups that eventually came down to individual camps and there was a hierarchy of chiefs going back up to the main seven High Chiefs. Similar to the idea of Moieties from eastern native peoples, a child was considered a relative of both his father & mother's camps and could marry no one from either. Since the migrations generally brought them into closer proximity to the same camps over and over again, this quickly caused serious problems for the legality of marriage. Some of the peoples chose to forego the law, but most were disturbed by the possibility, likening it to incest in their minds, and refused. It's probably because of this, as well as constant warfare, that the acquisition of women as conquest and slave property became more and more common among the Dakota Oyate. The women did have their own rights, but it seems like most of these were moreso in place to preserve the honor of their men as warriors & not to really protect them. Unless they had close relatives who they could reach, or were able to maneuver themselves to get help from another man, these women were basically trapped. Polygamy was also allowed, as it was among most native peoples in one form or another.\\r\\nThe ordering of camps was fairly simple. The tents were always organized into circles with the entrance facing the rising sun and the most important home centered directly at the west end. The families within these tents also slept in a similar manner, with the head of household directly across from the door, the eldest son to one side, the second eldest to the right, and little general order beyond that. The ordering of the tents would get more and more complicated, depending on what all groups happened to be camping together.\\r\\nThe chiefs could be male or female (although female chiefs were rare) and were counseled by an ever-changing group of elders, depending on the situation. Apparently, these councilors were almost always male. A type of police force known as the Akicita were organized to keep the peace & other military & religious societies and organizations provided different services to the community in both war and peace-times. The Chief elected the lead Akicita, and this person nominated his officers as he saw fit, as did the other groups. Seemingly, it was also considered a crime to turn down an offer to take on a title, with the exception of chief, once publicly nominated. Men and women both were also allowed to be nominated to any position. Punishments for crime were said to have been beatings, destruction of property, posting bail and, in worst-case scenarios, death. For whatever reason, posting bail was generally looked down upon as the cowards' way out. [20]\\r\\nThe Dakota language is a Mississippi Valley Siouan language, belonging to the greater Siouan-Catawban language family. It is closely related to and mutually intelligible with the Lakota language, and both are also more distantly related to the Stoney and Assiniboine languages. Dakota is written in the Latin script and has a dictionary and grammar.[1]\\r\\nThe Dakota maintain many separate tribal governments scattered across several reservations and communities in North America: in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Montana in the United States; and in Manitoba, southern Saskatchewan in Canada.\\r\\nThe earliest known European record of the Dakota identified them in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. After the introduction of the horse in the early 18th century, the Sioux dominated larger areas of landfrom present day Central Canada to the Platte River, from Minnesota to the Yellowstone River, including the Powder River country.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Santee migrated north and westward from the Southeast United States, first into Ohio, then to Minnesota. Some came up from the Santee River and Lake Marion, area of South Carolina. The Santee River was named after them, and some of their ancestors' ancient earthwork mounds have survived along the portion of the dammed-up river that forms Lake Marion. In the past, they were a Woodland people who thrived on hunting, fishing and farming.\\r\\nMigrations of Ojibwe people from the east in the 17th and 18th centuries, with muskets supplied by the French and British, pushed the Dakota further into Minnesota and west and southward. The US gave the name \\"Dakota Territory\\" to the northern expanse west of the Mississippi River and up to its headwaters.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ih?kthu?wa?-Ih?kthu?wa?na, also known by the anglicized spelling Yankton (Ih?kthu?wa?: \\"End village\\") and Yanktonai (Ih?kthu?wa?na: \\"Little end village\\") divisions consist of two bands or two of the seven council fires. According to Nasunatanka and Matononpa in 1880, the Yanktonai are divided into two sub-groups known as the Upper Yanktonai and the Lower Yanktonai (H~?kpathina).[22]\\r\\nThey were involved in quarrying pipestone. The Yankton-Yanktonai moved into northern Minnesota. In the 18th century, they were recorded as living in the Mankato (Maka To ÿ Earth Blue/Blue Earth) region of southwestern Minnesota along the Blue Earth River.[23]\\r\\nContemporary Sioux people are also listed under the tribes to which they belong:","input":"Where did the dakota tribe live in minnesota?"},{"output":"the medieval period","context":"The estates of the realm, or three estates, were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in Christendom (Christian Europe) from the medieval period to early modern Europe. Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.\\r\\nThe best known system is the French Ancien Rgime (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the French Revolution (1789ÿ1799). Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobles (the Second Estate), and peasants and bourgeoisie (the Third Estate). In some regions, notably Scandinavia and Russia, burghers (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights. In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and bishops into one lordly estate with \\"commons\\" as the second estate. This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), ritters (knights), and burghers was used.\\r\\nToday the terms three estates and estates of the realm may sometimes be re-interpreted to refer to the modern separation of powers in government into the legislature, administration, and the judiciary. Additionally the term fourth estate usually refers to forces outside the established power structure (evoking medieval three-estate systems), most commonly in reference to the independent press or media. Historically, in Northern and Eastern Europe, the Fourth Estate meant rural commoners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, advancing to different social classes was uncommon and very difficult.\\r\\nThe medieval Church was an institution where social mobility was most likely up to a certain level (generally to that of vicar general or abbot/abbess for commoners). Typically, only nobility were appointed to the highest church positions (bishops, archbishops, heads of religious orders, etc.), although low nobility could aspire to the highest church positions. Since clergy could not marry, such mobility was theoretically limited to one generation. Nepotism was common in this period.\\r\\nAnother possible way to rise in social position was due to exceptional military or commercial success. Such families were rare and their rise to nobility required royal patronage at some point. However, because noble lines went extinct naturally, some number of ennoblements was necessary.\\r\\n\\"Medieval political speculation is imbued to the marrow with the idea of a structure of society based upon distinct orders,\\" Johan Huizinga observes.[1] The virtually synonymous terms estate and order designated a great variety of social realities, not at all limited to a class, Huizinga concluded applying to every social function, every trade, every recognisable grouping.\\r\\nThere are, first of all, the estates of the realm, but there are also the trades, the state of matrimony and that of virginity, the state of sin. At court there are the 'four estates of the body and mouth': bread-masters, cup-bearers, carvers, and cooks. In the Church there are sacerdotal orders and monastic orders. Finally there are the different orders of chivalry.[1]\\r\\nThis static view of society was predicated on inherited positions. Commoners were universally considered the lowest order. The higher estates' necessary dependency on the commoners' production, however, often further divided the otherwise equal common people into burghers (also known as bourgeoisie) of the realm's cities and towns, and the peasants and serfs of the realm's surrounding lands and villages. A person's estate and position within it were usually inherited from the father and his occupation, similar to a caste within that system. In many regions and realms there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates.\\r\\nLegislative bodies or advisory bodies to a monarch were traditionally grouped along lines of these estates, with the monarch above all three estates. Meetings of the estates of the realm became early legislative and judicial parliaments. Monarchs often sought to legitimize their power by requiring oaths of fealty from the estates. Today, in most countries, the estates have lost all their legal privileges, and are mainly of historical interest. The nobility may be an exception, for instance due to legislation against false titles of nobility; similarly British government well maintains the distinction- witness its House of Lords, and the House of Commons.\\r\\nOne of the earliest political pamphlets to address these ideas was called \\"What Is the Third Estate?\\" (French: Qu'est-ce que le tiers-tat?) It was written by Abb Emmanuel Joseph Sieys in January 1789, shortly before the start of the French Revolution.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, numerous geographic and ethnic kingdoms developed among the endemic peoples of Europe, affecting their day-to-day secular lives; along with those, the growing influence of the Catholic Church and its Papacy affected the ethical, moral and religious lives and decisions of all. This led to mutual dependency between the secular and religious powers for guidance and protection, but over time and with the growing power of the kingdoms, competing secular realities increasingly diverged from religious idealism and Church decisions.\\r\\nThe new lords of the land identified themselves primarily as warriors, but because new technologies of warfare were expensive, and the fighting men required substantial material resources and considerable leisure to train, these needs had to be filled. The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect.\\r\\nIn his book The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined, the French medievalist Georges Duby has shown that in the period 1023-1025 the first theorist who justified the division of European society into the three estates of the realm was Gerard of Florennes, the bishop of Cambrai.[2]\\r\\nAs a result of the Investiture Controversy of the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the powerful office of Holy Roman Emperor lost much of its religious character and retained a more nominal universal preeminence over other rulers, though it varied. The struggle over investiture and the reform movement also legitimized all secular authorities, partly on the grounds of their obligation to enforce discipline.[3]\\r\\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries thinkers argued that human society consisted of three orders: those who pray, those who fight, and those who labour. The structure of the first order, the clergy, was in place by 1200 and remained singly intact until the religious reformations of the 16th century. The very general category of those who labour (specifically, those who were not knightly warriors or nobles) diversified rapidly after the 11th century into the lively and energetic worlds of peasants, skilled artisans, merchants, financiers, lay professionals, and entrepreneurs, which together drove the European economy to its greatest achievements. The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous. Kings took pains to ensure that it did not resist their authority.[4]\\r\\nBy the 12th century, most European political thinkers agreed that monarchy was the ideal form of governance. This was because it imitated on earth the model set by God for the universe; it was the form of government of the ancient Hebrews and the Christian Biblical basis, the later Roman Empire, and also the peoples who succeeded Rome after the 4th century.[3]\\r\\nFrance under the Ancien Rgime (before the French Revolution) divided society into three estates: the First Estate (clergy); the Second Estate (nobility); and the Third Estate (commoners). The king was considered part of no estate.\\r\\nThe First Estate comprised the entire clergy, traditionally divided into \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" clergy. Although there was no formal demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from the families of the Second Estate. In the time of Louis XVI, every bishop in France was a nobleman, a situation that had not existed before the 18th century.[5]\\r\\nAt the other extreme, the \\"lower clergy\\" (about equally divided between parish priests and monks and nuns) constituted about 90 percent of the First Estate, which in 1789 numbered around 130,000 (about 0.5% of the population).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Second Estate (Fr. deuxieme tat) was the French nobility and (technically, though not in common use) royalty, other than the monarch himself, who stood outside of the system of estates.\\r\\nThe Second Estate is traditionally divided into noblesse d'pe (\\"nobility of the sword\\"), and noblesse de robe (\\"nobility of the robe\\"), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government.\\r\\nThe Second Estate constituted approximately 1.5% of France's population.[citation needed] Under the ancien rgime (\\"old rule/old government\\"), the Second Estate were exempt from the corve royale (forced labour on the roads) and from most other forms of taxation such as the gabelle (salt tax) and most important, the taille (the oldest form of direct taxation). This exemption from paying taxes led to their reluctance to reform.\\r\\nThe Third Estate comprised all of those who were not members of the above and can be divided into two groups, urban and rural, together making up 98% of France's population.[citation needed] The urban included wage-labourers. The rural included free peasants (who owned their own land) who could be prosperous and villeins (serfs, or peasants working on a noble's land). The free peasants paid disproportionately high taxes compared to the other Estates and were unhappy because they wanted more rights. In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's unequal status all the more glaring.\\r\\nThere were an estimated 27 million people in the Third Estate when the French Revolution started.\\r\\nThey had the hard life of physical labour and food shortages.[citation needed] Most were born within this group and died as a part of it, too. It was extremely rare for people of this ascribed status to make it out into another estate. Those who did so managed as a result of either being recognized for their extraordinary bravery in a battle or entering religious life.[6] A few commoners were able to marry into the second estate, but this was a rare occurrence.[6]\\r\\nThe first Estates General (not to be confused with a \\"class of citizen\\") was actually a general citizen assembly that was called by Philip IV in 1302.\\r\\nIn the period leading up to the Estates General of 1789, France was in the grip of an unmanageable public debt (nearly 3.56 million livres).[7] In May 1776, finance minister Turgot was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, Jacques Necker, a foreigner, was appointed Comptroller-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.[8]), terrible inflation and widespread food scarcity (a huge famine in the winter of 1788-89). This led to widespread popular discontent and produced a group of Third Estate representatives (612 exactly) pressing a comparatively radical set of reforms, much of it in alignment with the goals of Finance Minister Jacques Necker, but very much against the wishes of Louis XVI's court and many of the hereditary nobles forming his Second Estate allies (at least allies against taking more taxes upon themselves and keeping the unequal taxation on the commoners).\\r\\nWhen he could not persuade them to rubber-stamp his 'ideal program', Louis XVI sought to dissolve the Estates-General, but the Third Estate held out for their right to representation. The lower clergy (and some nobles and upper clergy) eventually sided with the Third Estate, and the King was forced to yield. Thus, the Estate-General meeting was an invitation to revolution.\\r\\nBy June, when continued impasses led to further deterioration in relations, the Estates-General was reconstituted first as the National Assembly (June 17, 1789) seeking a solution for the realm independent of the King's management of the meetings of the Estates General which occasionally continued to meet. These self-organized meetings are today defined as the epoch event beginning the historical epoch (era) of the French Revolution, during which ÿ after several more weeks of civil unrest ÿ the body assumed a new status as a revolutionary legislature, the National Constituent Assembly (July 9, 1789).[9]\\r\\nThis unitary body composed of the former representatives of the three estates stepping up to govern along with an emergency committee in the power vacuum existing after the Bourbon monarchy fled Paris. Among the Assembly was Maximilien de Robespierre, an influential member of the Jacobins who would years later become instrumental in the turbulent period of violence and political upheaval in France known as the Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 ÿ 28 July 1794).[9]\\r\\nWhilst the estates were never formulated in a way that prevented social mobility, the English (subsequently the British) parliament was long based along the classic estate lines being composed on the \\"Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons\\". The tradition where the Lords Spiritual and Temporal sat separately from the Commons began during the reign of Edward III in the 14th century.\\r\\nNotwithstanding the House of Lords Act 1999, the British Parliament still recognises the existence of the three estates: the Commons in the House of Commons, the nobility in the House of Lords, and the clergy in the form of the Church of England bishops also entitled to sit in the upper House as the Lords Spiritual.\\r\\nThe members of the Parliament of Scotland were collectively referred to as the Three Estates (Older Scots: Thre Estaitis), also known as the community of the realm, and until 1690 composed of:\\r\\nThe First Estate was overthrown during the Glorious Revolution and the accession of William III.[10] The Second Estate was then split into two to retain the division into three.\\r\\nA Shire Commissioner was the closest equivalent of the English office of Member of Parliament, namely a commoner or member of the lower nobility. Because the Parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same chamber, as opposed to the separate English House of Lords and House of Commons.\\r\\nThe Parliament also had University constituencies (see Ancient universities of Scotland). The system was also adopted by the Parliament of England when James VI ascended to the English throne. It was believed that the universities were affected by the decisions of Parliament and ought therefore to have representation in it. This continued in the Parliament of Great Britain after 1707 and the Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1950.[11]\\r\\nThe Estates in Sweden (including Finland) and later also Russia's Grand Duchy of Finland were the two higher estates, nobility and clergy, and the two lower estates, burghers and land-owning peasants. Each were free men, and had specific rights and responsibilities, and the right to send representatives to the Riksdag of the Estates. At the Riksdag, each Estate voted as a single body. Since early 18th century, a bill needed the approval of at least three Estates to pass, and constitutional amendments required the approval of all Estates. Prior to the 18th century, the King had the right to cast a deciding vote if the Estates were split evenly.\\r\\nAfter Russia's conquest of Finland in 1809, a Finnish House of Nobility was codified in 1818 in accordance with the old Swedish law of 1723. However the Diet of Finland and its four estates was not convened until 1863.\\r\\nThere was also a population outside the estates. Unlike in other areas, people had no \\"default\\" estate, and were not peasants unless they came from a land-owner's family. A summary of this division is:\\r\\nIn Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property. Nevertheless, many of the leading politicians of the 19th century continued to be drawn from the old estates, in that they were either noblemen themselves, or represented agricultural and urban interests. Ennoblements continued even after the estates had lost their political importance, with the last ennoblement of explorer Sven Hedin taking place in 1902; this practice was formally abolished with the adoption of the new Constitution January 1, 1975, while the status of the House of Nobility continued to be regulated in law until 2003.\\r\\nIn Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772. However, at the start of the 20th century most of the population did not belong to any Estate and had no political representation. A particularly large class were the rent farmers, who did not own the land they cultivated but had to work in the land-owner's farm to pay their rent (unlike Russia, there were no slaves or serfs.) Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system.\\r\\nThe political system was reformed as a result of the Finnish general strike of 1905, with the last Diet instituting a new constitutional law to create the modern parliamentary system, ending the political privileges of the estates. The post-independence constitution of 1919 forbade ennoblement, and all tax privileges were abolished in 1920. The privileges of the estates were officially and finally abolished in 1995,[12] although in legal practice, the privileges had long been unenforceable. As in Sweden, the nobility has not been officially abolished and records of nobility are still voluntarily maintained by the Finnish House of Nobility.\\r\\nIn Finland, it is still illegal and punishable by jail time (up to one year) to defraud into marriage by declaring a false name or estate (Rikoslaki 18 luku  1/Strafflagen 18 kap.  1).\\r\\nThe Low Countries, which until the late sixteenth century consisted of several counties, prince bishoprics, duchies etc. in the area that is now modern Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, had no States General until 1464, when Duke Philip of Burgundy assembled the first States General in Bruges. Later in the 15th and 16th centuries Brussels became the place where the States General assembled. On these occasions deputies from the States of the various provinces (as the counties, prince-bishoprics and duchies were called) asked for more liberties. For this reason, the States General were not assembled very often.\\r\\nAs a consequence of the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and the events that followed afterwards, the States General declared that they no longer obeyed King Philip II of Spain, who was also overlord of the Netherlands. After the reconquest of the southern Netherlands (roughly Belgium and Luxemburg), the States General of the Dutch Republic first assembled permanently in Middelburg, and in The Hague from 1585 onward. Without a king to rule the country, the States General became the sovereign power. It was the level of government where all things were dealt with that were of concern to all the seven provinces that became part of the Republic of the United Netherlands.\\r\\nDuring that time the States General were formed by representatives of the States (i.e. provincial parliaments) of the seven provinces. In each States (a plurale tantum) sat representatives of the nobility and the cities (the clergy were no longer represented; in Friesland the peasants were indirectly represented by the Grietmannen).\\r\\nIn the Southern Netherlands, the last meetings of the States General loyal to the Habsburgs took place in the Estates General of 1600 and the Estates General of 1632.\\r\\nAs a government, the States General of the Dutch Republic were abolished in 1795. A new parliament was created, called Nationale Vergadering (National Assembly). It no longer consisted of representatives of the States, let alone the Estates: all men were considered equal under the 1798 Constitution. Eventually, the Netherlands became part of the French Empire under Napoleon (1810: La Hollande est reunie  l'Empire).\\r\\nAfter regaining independence in November 1813, the name \\"States General\\" was resurrected for a legislature constituted in 1814 and elected by the States-Provincial. In 1815, when the Netherlands were united with Belgium and Luxemburg, the States General were divided into two chambers: the First Chamber and the Second Chamber. The members of the First Chamber were appointed for life by the King, while the members of the Second Chamber were elected by the members of the States Provincial. The States General resided in The Hague and Brussels in alternate years until 1830, when, as a result of the Belgian Revolution, The Hague became once again the sole residence of the States General, Brussels instead hosting the newly founded Belgian Parliament.\\r\\nFrom 1848 on, the Dutch Constitution provides that members of the Second Chamber be elected by the people (at first only by a limited portion of the male population; universal male and female suffrage exists since 1919), while the members of the First Chamber are chosen by the members of the States Provincial. As a result, the Second Chamber became the most important. The First Chamber is also called Senate. This however, is not a term used in the Constitution.\\r\\nOccasionally the First and Second Chamber meet in a Verenigde Vergadering (Joint Session), for instance on Prinsjesdag, the annual opening of the parliamentary year, and when a new king is inaugurated.\\r\\nThe Holy Roman Empire had the Imperial Diet (Reichstag). The clergy was represented by the independent prince-bishops, prince-archbishops and prince-abbots of the many monasteries. The nobility consisted of independent aristocratic rulers: secular prince-electors, kings, dukes, margraves, counts and others. Burghers consisted of representatives of the independent imperial cities. Many peoples whose territories within the Holy Roman Empire had been independent for centuries had no representatives in the Imperial Diet, and this included the Imperial Knights and independent villages. The power of the Imperial Diet was limited, despite efforts of centralization.\\r\\nLarge realms of the nobility or clergy had estates of their own that could wield great power in local affairs. Power struggles between ruler and estates were comparable to similar events in the history of the British and French parliaments.\\r\\nThe Swabian League, a significant regional power in its part of Germany during the 15th Century, also had its own kind of Estates, a governing Federal Council comprising three Colleges: those of Princes, Cities, and Knights.\\r\\nIn the late Russian Empire the estates were called sosloviyes. The four major estates were: nobility (dvoryanstvo), clergy, rural dwellers, and urban dwellers, with a more detailed stratification therein. The division in estates was of mixed nature: traditional, occupational, as well as formal: for example, voting in Duma was carried out by estates. Russian Empire Census recorded the reported estate of a person.\\r\\nThe Parliament of Catalonia was first established in 1283 as the Catalan Courts (Corts Catalanes), according to American historian Thomas Bisson, and it has been considered by several historians as a model of medieval parliament. For instance, English historian of constitutionalism Charles Howard McIlwain wrote that the General Courts of Catalonia, during the 14th century, had a more defined organization and met more regularly than the parliaments of England or France.[13]\\r\\nThe roots of the parliament institution in Catalonia are in the Sanctuary and Truce Assemblies (assemblees de pau i treva) that started in the 11th century. The members of the parliament of Catalonia were organized in the Three Estates (Catalan: Tres Estats):\\r\\nThe parliament institution was abolished in 1716, together with the rest of institutions of Catalonia, after the War of the Spanish Succession.\\r\\nLocation specific:\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"When were the three estates of france established?"},{"output":"a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary","context":"In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary, is a region of active deformation where two or more tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere are near the end of their life cycle. This is in contrast to a constructive plate boundary (also known as a mid-ocean ridge or spreading center). As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near destructive boundaries, where subduction zones or an area of continental collision (depending on the nature of the plates involved) occurs. The subducting plate in a subduction zone is normally oceanic crust, and moves beneath the other plate, which can be made of either oceanic or continental crust. During collisions between two continental plates, large mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas are formed. In other regions, a divergent boundary or transform faults may be present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for the existence of convergent boundaries are the mid-ocean ridges that were only beginning to be understood with the acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics in the mid-1960s. The radioactive decay of elements within the rocks in the interior of the earth generates large amounts of heat that moves magma to the surface of the crust in a process called mantle convection. This results in a new oceanic crust or sea floor being formed that slowly moves away from the ridges (sometimes called spreading centers) towards the subduction zones. In other words, new seafloor originates from the upwelling rock as it emerges from the depths of the mantle and it slowly cools as it is transported over the millennia to the collision or subduction zones where it is consumed or recycled.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge, shallow earthquakes on subduction zone interfaces are the largest types of earthquakes. They accounted for 90% of the total seismic moment released for the period 1900ÿ1989, but these events usually occur offshore and far from population centers. Non-subduction interface earthquakes also occur in the region of the trench including shallow upper plate shocks, deeper events within the downgoing slab, and events that are related to outer trench swell.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA volcanic arc is formed on the continental plate, above the location of the downgoing oceanic slab. The volcanic arc is the surface expression of the magma that is generated by hydrous melting of the mantle above the downgoing slab. Hydrated minerals (e.g., phlogopite, lawsonite, amphibole) within the oceanic lithosphere become unstable at certain depths due to increased temperature and pressure, causing the crystal structure of the hydrated minerals break down and release water. The buoyant fluids then rise into the asthenosphere, where they lower the melting temperature of the mantle and cause partial melting. These melts rise to the surface and are the source of some of the most explosive volcanism on Earth because of their high volumes of extremely pressurized gases.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen two plates with oceanic crust converge, they typically create an island arc as one plate is subducted below the other. The arc is formed from volcanoes which erupt through the overriding plate as the descending plate melts below it. The arc shape occurs because of the spherical surface of the earth (nick the peel of an orange with a knife and note the arc formed by the straight-edge of the knife). A deep oceanic trench is located in front of such arcs where the descending slab dips downward, such as the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome convergent margins have zones of active seafloor spreading behind the island arc, known as back-arc basins. \\r\\nWhen one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range. This type of convergent boundary is similar to the Andes or the Cascade Range in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn oceanic trench is found where the denser plate is subducted underneath the other plate.  There is water in the rocks of the oceanic plate (because they are underwater), and as this plate moves further down into the subduction zone, much of the water contained in the plate is squeezed out when the plate begins to subduct. However, the recrystallization of ocean floor rocks, such as serpentinite, which are unstable in the upper mantle, recrystallize into olivine, causing dehydration through loss of hydroxyl groups. This addition of water to the mantle causes partial melting of the mantle, generating magma, which then rises, and which normally results in volcanoes. This normally happens at a certain depth, about 70 to 80 miles below the Earth's surface, and so volcanoes are formed fairly close to, but not right next to, the trench.","input":"What type of boundary created the himalayan mountains?"},{"output":"Manhunter","context":"The Hannibal Lecter franchise is an American media franchise that features the titular character, Hannibal Lecter, who originally appeared in a series of novels (starting with Red Dragon in 1981) by Thomas Harris.

It is on the western seaboard of Afro-Eurasia, the world's largest land mass. Since the UK is always in or close to the path of the polar front jet stream, frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. In general the climate of the UK is cool and often cloudy, and hot temperatures are infrequent.\\r\\nThe climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K?ppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of north-west Europe.[1] Regional climates are influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and latitude. Northern Ireland, Wales and western parts of England and Scotland, being closest to the Atlantic Ocean, are generally the mildest, wettest and windiest regions of the UK, and temperature ranges here are seldom extreme. Eastern areas are drier, cooler, less windy and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Northern areas are generally cooler, wetter and have slightly larger temperature ranges than southern areas.\\r\\nThe UK is mostly under the influence of the maritime polar air mass from the north-west. Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland are the most exposed to the maritime polar air mass which brings cool moist air; the east of Scotland and north-east England are more exposed to the continental polar air mass which brings cold dry air. South and south-east of England are the least exposed to Polar air masses from the north-west, and on occasion see continental tropical air mass from the south, which brings warm dry air in the summer.\\r\\nIf the air masses are strong enough in their respective areas during the summer, there can sometimes be a large difference in temperature between the far north of Scotland (including the Islands) and south-east of England ÿ often a difference of 10ÿ15?C (18-27?F) but sometimes of as much as 20?C (36?F) or more. In the height of summer the Northern Isles could have temperatures around 15?C (59?F) and areas around London could reach 30?C (86?F).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland generally has higher maximum & minimum temperatures than the other areas of the UK, though Wales has higher minima from November to February, and Northern Ireland has higher maxima from December to February. England is also sunnier throughout the year, but unlike Wales, Northern Ireland & Scotland, the sunniest month is July, totalling 193.5 hours. It rains on fewer days in every month throughout the year than the rest of the UK, and rainfall totals are less in every month, with the driest month, May, averaging 58.4?mm (2.30?in).[2] The climate of south-west England displays a seasonal temperature variation, although it is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom. Gales are less common in England compared to Scotland; however on some occasions there can be strong winds, and rarely, the remains of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms. Some events such as the Great Storm of 1987 occurred near to the UK and caused damage in England. The prevailing wind direction for England is from the south-west.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthern Ireland is warmer than Scotland throughout the year. Maximum temperatures are milder than in Wales from December to April, and milder than in England from December to February, but Northern Ireland is cooler during the rest of the year. Sunshine totals in every month are more than those of Scotland, but less than those of the rest of Great Britain. Northern Ireland is drier and has fewer rainy days than Scotland throughout the year, except in May, when it rains on more days. Northern Ireland is also drier than Wales in every month, yet it rains on more days. The rainiest month is January, when 17.8 days have more than 1?mm (0.04?in) of rain on average.[11]\\r\\nScotland has the coolest weather of any country in the United Kingdom throughout the year (with the climate at altitude varying into Cfc), with average minimum temperatures in January of ?0.2?C (31.6?F).[12] Scotland is also the wettest country in every month, apart from May, June and December, when Wales is wetter. The wettest month is January, with 170.5?mm (6.71?in) on average.[12] Scotland is also the cloudiest country throughout the year, apart from June and July, when Northern Ireland is.\\r\\nWales has warmer temperatures throughout the year than Scotland, and has milder winter minima than England, but cooler winter maxima than Northern Ireland. Wales is wetter throughout the year than Northern Ireland and England, but has fewer rainy days than Northern Ireland; meaning that rainfall tends to be more intense. Wales is also drier than Scotland in every month apart from May, June and December, and there are fewer days with rain than in Scotland. Sunshine totals throughout the year are more than that of Scotland and Northern Ireland, but less than that of neighbouring England. May is the sunniest month, averaging 186.8 hours.[17]\\r\\nSpring is the period from March to May. Spring is generally a calm, cool season, particularly because the Atlantic has lost much of its heat throughout the autumn and winter. As the sun rises higher in the sky and the days get longer, temperatures slowly rise, but the solar effect is mitigated somewhat by the effect of the cool ocean waters and westerly winds that blow across them.\\r\\nThere is a fair chance of snow earlier in the season when temperatures are colder - often in March. Some of the country's heaviest snowfalls of recent years have happened in the first half of March, and snow showers can occur infrequently until mid-April. They have been known to develop as late as mid-May over some areas of the country, such as in 2013 when snow was recorded on 14 May over parts of Staffordshire, Herefordshire and Wales. Snow was also recorded at lower levels in early June 1975. More recently, there was a disruptive snow event between 26 and 29 April 2016 across much of Northern England and Scotland, which was unusually the only significant snow event of the winter 2015/16. Snow, frost and ice can be disruptive and damaging to flowering plants, particularly later in the spring.\\r\\nEarly spring can be quite cold, and occasionally the lowest temperatures of the year can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even in the south of the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above 30?C are generally rare but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when 31.9?C was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 in most parts of the UK. In Aberdaron, the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach 20?C, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be very dramatic temperature swings between day night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just 3?C at Northolt, but 25?C was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in Spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.\\r\\nMean temperatures in Spring are markedly influenced by latitude. Most of Scotland and the mountains of Wales and northern England are the coolest areas of the UK, with average temperatures ranging from ?0.6 to 5.8?C (30.9 to 42.4?F).[18] The southern half of England experiences the warmest spring temperatures of between 8.8 and 10.3?C (47.8 and 50.5?F).[18]\\r\\nSummer lasts from June to August and is the warmest and usually the sunniest season. Rainfall totals can have a wide local variation due to localised thundershowers. These thundershowers mainly occur in southern, eastern, and central England and are less frequent and severe in the north and west.[19] Climatic differences at this time of year are more influenced by latitude and proximity to the ocean. Temperatures are the highest in southern and central areas and lowest in the north. Hot weather above 27?C in most places and in most years occurs on multiple days per year, but more frequently in London and south-east England and less so in parts of Scotland.[20] The record maximum is 38.5?C (101.3?F) recorded in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003.[21]\\r\\nAutumn in the United Kingdom lasts from September to November.[22] The season is notorious for being unsettledas cool polar air moves southwards following the sun, it meets the warm air of the tropics and produces an area of great disturbance along which the country lies. This combined with the warm ocean due to heating throughout the spring and summer, produces the unsettled weather of autumn. In addition, when the air is particularly cold temperatures on land may be colder than the ocean, resulting in significant amounts of condensation and clouds which bring rain to the country.\\r\\nAtlantic depressions during this time can become intense and winds of hurricane force (greater than 119?km/h or 74?mph) can be recorded. Western areas, being closest to the Atlantic, experience these severe conditions to a significantly greater extent than eastern areas. As such, autumn, particularly the latter part, is often the stormiest time of the year. One particularly intense depression was the Great Storm of 1987. A very severe storm affected the UK on 27 October 2002 which, at Mumbles head near Swansea, recorded maximum sustained wind speeds of over 123?km/h, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane.[23] The autumn of 2013 was also littered with severe storms, including the St. Jude's Storm on 28 October 2013.\\r\\nAutumn can also be a cold season at times - in recent years, very low temperatures and heavy snowfall have been recorded during November 1985, November 1993 & November 2010, which set a new record low of -18.0?C in Wales on 28 November 2010. At Northolt, the coldest temperature of the year 2016 was set on 30 November. Snow also fell rather widely across the UK on 28 & 29 October 2008, causing traffic problems where it settled on the M4. Even further south, low temperatures can be recorded, with temperatures well below freezing as far south as Heathrow Airport between 29 & 31 October 1997 - for context, the low of 30 October 1997 recorded was lower than any recorded at this station in March, November or December 1997 and even the following January, 1998 - only the low temperatures on 2 & 4 February 1998 prevented it from being the lowest temperature of the winter at this station. The first frosts of the winter are usually recorded between October & December, but they are quite unusual in September except on high ground when the surrounding ocean is at or near its warmest. It is not particularly unusual for September to be warmer than June, as it was in 1999.[24]\\r\\nHowever, the United Kingdom sometimes experiences an 'Indian Summer', where temperatures particularly by night can be very mild and rarely fall below 10?C (50?F). Such events are aided by the surrounding Atlantic Ocean and seas being at their warmest, keeping the country in warm air, despite the relatively weak sun. Examples of this were in 1985, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2011[25] and 2016 where September saw above average temperatures which felt more like a continuation of summer than autumn. Autumns since 2000 have generally been very mild with notable extremes of precipitation; the UK has seen some of its wettest and driest autumns since the millennium. 2011 and 2016 were notable as many areas of the country recorded their highest temperatures of the year in September and October (for example, 28.2?C at Hawarden on 1 October, 26.3?C at St. Athan on 2 October 2011 and the UK's highest temperature of 2016 on 13 September with 34.4?C at Gravesend).[26]\\r\\nCoastal areas in the southern half of England have on average the warmest autumns, with mean temperatures of 10.7 to 13.0?C (51.3 to 55.4?F).[27] Mountainous areas of Wales and northern England, and almost all of Scotland, experience mean temperatures between 1.7 and 7.5?C (35.1 and 45.5?F).[27]\\r\\nWinter in the UK is defined as lasting from December to February. The season is generally cool, wet, windy, and cloudy. Temperatures at night rarely drop below ?10?C (14?F) and in the day rarely rise above 15?C (59?F). Precipitation is plentiful throughout the season, though snow is relatively infrequent despite the country's high latitude: The only areas with significant snowfall are the Scottish Highlands and the Pennines, where at higher elevations a colder climate determines the vegetation, mainly temperate coniferous forest, although deforestation has severely decreased forest area. For a majority of the landmass snow is possible but not frequent, apart from the higher altitudes, where snow can lie 1ÿ5 months or even beyond 6 months.\\r\\nTowards the later part of the season the weather usually stabilises with less wind, less precipitation and lower temperatures. This change is particularly pronounced near the coasts mainly because the Atlantic ocean is often at its coldest during this time after being cooled throughout the autumn and the winter. The early part of winter however is often unsettled and stormy; often the wettest and windiest time of the year.\\r\\nSnow falls intermittently and mainly affects northern and eastern areas, high ground in Wales and especially the mountains of Scotland, where there is often enough snow lying to permit skiing at some of the five Scottish ski resorts. These resorts usually operate between December and April, depending on the snowfall. Frequently in the mountains potent depressions may move in from the north in the form of 'polar lows', introducing heavy snow and often blizzard-like conditions to parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland. Blizzards have become rarer in the 21st century, although much of England was affected by one on 30 January 2003. During periods of light winds and high pressure frost and fog can become a problem and can pose a major hazard for drivers on the roads.\\r\\nMean winter temperatures in the UK are most influenced by proximity to the sea. The coldest areas are the mountains of Wales and northern England, and inland areas of Scotland, averaging ?3.6 to 2.3?C (25.5 to 36.1?F).[28] Coastal areas, particularly those in the south and west, experience the mildest winters, on average 5 to 8.7?C (41.0 to 47.7?F).[28] Hardiness zones in the UK are high, ranging from zone 7 in the Scottish Highlands, the Pennines and Snowdonia, to zone 10 on the Isles of Scilly. Most of the UK lies in zones 8 or 9.[29] In zone 7, the average lowest temperature each year is between ?17.7 and ?12.3?C (0.1 and 9.9?F), and in zone 10, this figure is between ?1.1 and 4.4?C (30.0 and 39.9?F).[30]\\r\\nSnow in the UK falls almost every year, but in small quantities. The UK can suffer extreme winters like 1684, 1740, 1795 (when London received its record lowest temperature of ?21.1?C (?6.0?F)), 1947 and 1963. In 1963 it snowed on Boxing Day, and snow lasted in most areas until 6 March, with blizzards through February, which had significant and documented effects on the FA Cup - Wrexham were forced to play on sand for one tie. In modern times snow has generally become rarer, but the UK can still get heavy falls, such as in 1978/79, 1981/82, 1986/87 and 1990/91. The winter of 2008/09 produced the heaviest snowfall since 1991 between 1 and 3 February, and the winter of 2009-10 was even more severe, with many parts of the United Kingdom experiencing the coldest and snowiest winters since 1978/79; temperatures plummeted to ?22.3?C (?8.1?F) at Altnaharra, Sutherland ÿ close to the ?22.9?C (?9.2?F) recorded at the southernmost part of the globe[South Pole?] in the same period. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK was ?27.2?C (?17.0?F) which was recorded on 10 January 1982 and 11 February 1895 in Braemar, Scotland and on 30 December 1995 in Altnaharra, Scotland. December 2010 was the coldest December in 120 years; the CET (Central England Temperature) was -0.7?C; it was the coldest month since February 1986, and the coldest December since 1890. Many places had heavy snowfall and extreme cold, temperatures regularly fell below ?10.0?C (14.0?F)) across many areas. However, the cold subsided after Christmas Day, 2010. November 2010 saw an extremely severe cold snap, with lows of ?18.0?C (?0.4?F)) in Llysdinam on 28 November. The month saw temperatures below average, despite what was actually a very mild first half. Spring 2013 was also notoriously cold: March 2013 was the coldest month of the winter (and indeed 2013 as a whole), which is quite striking given that December 2012, January and February 2013 were all also below average in terms of temperature. The following winter was the opposite - in many places, only on 11 and 12 January was any snow recorded (some places having no snow at all), and the entire country was battered by a series of severe depressions and storms. The St Jude's Day storm first affected the UK on 26 October 2013, and many places saw no respite until a high swept across the country on 2 March 2014. Parts of the Somerset levels remained under water for most of the winter and well into spring. Record-equalling gusts of 142?mph were recorded off the north coast of Scotland on 5 December 2013, with notably severe storms also recorded on 2 November 2013, 24 December 2013, 3 January 2014 and 14 February 2014.\\r\\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, most of the winters were milder and usually wetter than average with daytime temperatures going below freezing a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 was the only one which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall & January 1997 was cold in the South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11 have however seen a different pattern with these three winters being defined as below or well below average with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; this was the first time three consecutive cold winters in the UK have occurred since the 1960s. Since the winter of 2012/2013, winters have been mild (exceptionally so in 2013/2014 and 2015/2016), although exceptionally wet. The winter of 2014/2015 was an oddity, in that it was generally quiet and sunny. December 2014 & January 2015 were a little milder than the average, February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 was cool and January 2017 was cold in the south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010.\\r\\nDecember 2015 became the wettest calendar month ever recorded in the United Kingdom, with January 2016 becoming the second wettest. In these months, some northern and western parts had 2 to 4 times as much rainfall as normal.[31] December 2015 was also the warmest December averaged over the whole UK, and had the highest positive anomaly for any month in the Central England temperature series which began in 1659 (CET was 9.7?C, this is warmer than even any March[32]). Most areas of southern England had average monthly temperatures 5-6?C above normal. Some plants flowered that would normally do so in the Spring or even Summer.[33] Hardly any stations in Wales and Southern England recorded any air frosts and temperatures were often comparable to those of April or May. The maximum recorded temperature was 17.2?C at Teignmouth in Devon and Plockton and Achnagart in the highlands of Scotland on 16th. The lowest daily mean temperature during December 2015 at Heathrow Airport was still 8.2?C on 9 December, comparable to the average daily high for the calendar month. Remarkably, December 2015 did not break any national records for high temperatures, just failing to reach the maximum England temperature of 17.7?C recorded on 2 December 1985 in Chivenor, Devon and on 11 December 1994 in Penkridge, Staffordshire.[34] Despite the warmth, it was the dullest December since 1989.[35]\\r\\nThe average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom is 1339.7 hours, which is just under 30% of the maximum possible (The maximum hours of sunshine possible in one year is approximately 4476 hours).[36] Generally the United Kingdom sees frequent cloudy skies due to its high latitude and oceanic controlled climate. The lowest sunshine hours are found in northern parts of the country and the highest in the southern parts and southern coast of England. The counties of Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex and Kent are the sunniest areas, which have annual average totals of around 1,750 hours of sunshine per year.[37] Northern, western and mountainous areas are generally the cloudiest areas of the UK, with some mountainous areas receiving fewer than 1,000 hours of sunshine a year.[37]\\r\\nValley areas such as the South Wales Valleys, due to their north-south orientation, receive less sunshine than lowland areas because the mountains on either side of the valley obscure the sun in the early morning and late evening. This is noticeable in winter where there are only a few hours of sunshine. The mountains of Wales, northern England and Scotland can be especially cloudy with extensive mist and fog. Near the coast, sea fog may develop in the spring and early summer. Radiation fog may develop over inland areas of Great Britain and can persist for hours or even days in the winter and can pose a major hazard for drivers and aircraft.\\r\\nOn occasions blocking anticyclones (high pressure systems) may move over the United Kingdom, which can persist for weeks or even months. The subsided, dry air often results in clear skies and few clouds, bringing frosty nights in winter and warm days in the summer.\\r\\nAverage hours of sunshine in winter range from 38ÿ108 hours in some mountainous areas and western Scotland, up to 217 hours in the south and east of England;[38] while average hours of sunshine in summer range from 294ÿ420 hours in northern Scotland and Northern Ireland, to 600ÿ760 hours in southern English coastal counties.[39] The most sunshine recorded in one month was 383.9 hours at Eastbourne (East Sussex) in July 1911.[37]\\r\\nOne of the greatest influences on the climate of the UK is the Atlantic Ocean and especially the Gulf Stream, which carries warm water up from lower latitudes and modifies the high latitude air masses that pass across the UK. This thermohaline circulation has a powerful moderating and warming effect on the country's climate. This warm water current warms the climate to such a great extent that if the current did not exist then temperatures in winter would be about 10?C (18?F) lower than they are today and similar to eastern Russia or Canada near the same latitude. The current allows England to have vineyards at the same latitude that Canada has polar bears. These warm ocean currents also bring substantial amounts of humidity which contributes to the notoriously wet climate that western parts of the UK experience.\\r\\nThe extent of the Gulf Stream's contribution to the actual temperature in western Europe is a matter of dispute.[40][41] It has been argued that atmospheric waves that bring warm air northwards contribute to the warmer temperatures than thermohaline circulation.[40]\\r\\nThe high latitude and proximity to a large ocean to the west means that the United Kingdom experiences strong winds. The prevailing wind is from the south-west, but it may blow from any direction for sustained periods of time. Winds are strongest near westerly facing coasts and exposed headlands.\\r\\nGales  which are defined as winds with speeds of 51 to 101?km/h (32 to 63?mph) are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the country. The Hebrides experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale-force winds) while inland areas in England and Wales receive fewer than 5 days of gale a year.[37] Areas of high elevation tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations, and Great Dun Fell in Cumbria (at 857?m or 2,812?ft) averaged 114 days of gale a year during the period 1963 to 1976. The highest gust recorded at a low level in England was 191?km/h (119?mph) at Gwennap Head in Cornwall on 15 December 1979,[37] and a 115?mph gust was also recorded at Shoreham-By-Sea on 16 October 1987. A disputed 122?mph gust was recorded on 16 October 1987 at Gorleston in Norfolk during the Great Storm of 1987. In Scotland, Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire recorded 229?km/h (142?mph) on 13 February 1989, which was equalled during Cyclone Xaver on 5 December 2013. Wales' highest wind speed gust of 200?km/h (124?mph) was set at Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan on 28 October 1989. Especially potent storm systems typically affect the UK during autumn and winter, with the winters of 1989/1990 and 2013/2014 particularly notable for the frequency and potency of storm systems.\\r\\nAn unofficial gust of 194?mph was recorded on the Shetland Isles during the New Year's Day Storm on 1 January 1992, and an equal unofficial 194?mph wind gust is claimed to have been set in the Cairngorm Mountains on 19 December 2008.[42]\\r\\nBarometric pressure plays a role in storm systems. For the United Kingdom, record figures for barometric pressure recordings are:[43]\\r\\nHighest - 1053.6mb (Aberdeen, 31 January 1902)\\r\\nLowest - 925.6mb (Ochtertyre, 26 January 1884)\\r\\nNotably a low pressure storm system affected the UK with a central pressure of 914.0mb on 10 January 1993, however this figure is not recorded over the UK but out in the Atlantic, despite the system affecting the UK.\\r\\nRainfall amounts can vary greatly across the United Kingdom and generally the further west and the higher the elevation, the greater the rainfall. The mountains of Wales, Scotland, the Pennines in Northern England and the moors of South West England are the wettest parts of the country, and in some of these places as much as 4,577 millimetres (180.2?in) of rain can fall annually,[44] making these locations some of the wettest in Europe. The wettest spot in the United Kingdom is Crib Goch, in Snowdonia, which has averaged 4,473 millimetres (176.1?in) rain a year over the past 30 years.[45][46] Most rainfall in the United Kingdom comes from North Atlantic depressions which roll into the country throughout the year from the west or southwest and are particularly frequent and intense in the autumn and winter. They can on occasions bring prolonged periods of heavy rain, and flooding is quite common.\\r\\nParts of England are surprisingly dry, which is contrary to the stereotypical viewLondon receives just below 650 millimetres (25.6?in) per annum,[47] which is less than Rome, Sydney, or New York City. In East Anglia it typically rains on about 113 days per year.[48] Most of the south, south-east and East Anglia receive less than 700 millimetres (27.6?in) of rain per year.[37] The English counties of Essex, Cambridgeshire - as well as parts of North Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire, Suffolk and Norfolk - are amongst the driest in the UK, with an average annual rainfall of around 600 millimetres (23.6?in). This is due to a mild rainshadow effect, due to mountainous parts of the South West, Wales and Cumbria blocking the moist airflow across the country to the east. In some years rainfall totals in Essex and South Suffolk can be below 450 millimetres (17.7?in) (especially areas around Colchester, Clacton and Ipswich) - less than the average annual rainfall in Jerusalem, Beirut and even some semi-arid parts of the world.\\r\\nParts of the United Kingdom have had drought problems in recent years, particularly in 2004-2006. Fires broke out in some areas, even across the normally damp higher ground of north-west England and Wales. The landscape in much of England and east Wales became very parched, even near the coast; water restrictions were in place in some areas.\\r\\nJuly 2006 was the hottest month on record for the United Kingdom and much of Europe,[49] however England has had warmer spells of 31 days which did not coincide with a calendar monthin 1976 and 1995. As well as low rainfall, drought problems were made worse by the fact that the driest parts of England also have the highest population density, and therefore highest water consumption. The drought problems ended in the period from October 2006 to January 2007, which had well above average rainfall.\\r\\nDecember 2015 was the wettest month ever recorded in the United Kingdom.[50] The average rainfall for the month was almost doubled.[51]\\r\\nGenerally the United Kingdom has cool to mild winters and warm summers with moderate variation in temperature throughout the year. In England the average annual temperature varies from 8.5?C (47.3?F) in the north to 11?C (51.8?F) in the south, but over the higher ground this can be several degrees lower.[37] This small variation in temperature is to a large extent due to the moderating effect the Atlantic ocean haswater has a much greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer.\\r\\nThe ocean is at its coldest in February or early March, thus around coastal areas February is often the coldest month, but inland there is little to choose between February and January as the coldest.[37] Temperatures tend to drop lowest on late winter nights inland, in the presence of high pressure, clear skies, light winds and when there is snow on the ground. On occasions, cold polar or continental air can be drawn in over the United Kingdom to bring very cold weather.\\r\\nThe floors of inland valleys away from warming influence of the sea can be particularly cold as cold, dense air drains into them. A temperature of ?26.1?C (?15.0?F) was recorded under such conditions at Edgmond in Shropshire on 10 January 1982, the coldest temperature recorded in England and Wales. The following day the coldest maximum temperature in England, at ?11.3?C (11.7?F), was recorded at the same site.[37]\\r\\nOn average the warmest winter temperatures occur on the south and west coasts, however, warm temperatures occasionally occur due to a foehn wind warming up downwind after the crossing the mountains. Temperatures in these areas can rise to 15?C (59?F) in winter on rare occasions[52] This is a particularly notable event in northern Scotland, mainly Aberdeenshire, where these high temperatures can occur in midwinter when the sun only reaches about 10 above the horizon.\\r\\nJuly is on average the warmest month, and the highest temperatures tend to occur away from the Atlantic in southern, eastern and central England, where summer temperatures can rise above 30?C (86?F). It soared to 38.5?C (101.3?F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003: the highest temperature ever recorded in the United Kingdom.[53]\\r\\nWhile the United Kingdom is not particularly noted for extreme weather, it does sometimes occur, and events such as floods and drought may be experienced. The summer of 1976, for example, experienced temperatures as high as 35?C (95?F), and it was so dry the country suffered drought and water shortages.[54]\\r\\nExtended periods of extreme weather, such as the droughts of 1975ÿ1976, summer 2006, and spring 2012, the long hot summers of 1911, 1976, 2003 and 2006, and the winters of 1946ÿ1947, 1962ÿ1963, 2009ÿ2010, and 2010ÿ2011 are often caused by blocking anti-cyclones which can persist for several days, weeks, or even months. In winter they can bring long periods of cold dry weather and in summer long periods of hot dry weather.\\r\\nThere have also been occurrences of severe flash floods caused by intense rainfall; the most severe was the Lynmouth disaster of 1952 in which 34 people died and 38 houses and buildings were completely destroyed. In the summer of 2004, a severe flash flood devastated the town of Boscastle in Cornwall. However, the worst floods in the United Kingdom in modern times occurred in the North Sea flood of 1953. A powerful storm from the Atlantic moved around Scotland and down the east coast of England. As it moved south it produced a storm surge which was magnified as the North Sea became narrower further south. By the time the storm affected south-east England and the Netherlands, the surge had reached the height of 3.6 metres (12?ft). Over 300 people were killed by the floods in eastern England.\\r\\nThunderstorms are most common in southern and eastern England, and least common in the north and west.[55] In London, thunderstorms occur on average 14ÿ19 days a year, while in most of Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland thunderstorms occur on around 3 days a year.[55] Occasionally, thunderstorms can be severe and produce large hailstones as seen in Ottery St Mary, Devon in October 2008, where drifts reached 1.8 metres (5?ft 11?in).[56]\\r\\nStrong winds occur mainly in the autumn and winter months associated with low pressure systems and Scotland experiences hurricane-force winds in most winters. The Gale of January 1976, Great Storm of 1987 (23?fatalities) and the Burns' Day storm of 1990 (97?fatalities) are particularly severe examples; Scotland saw winds of 142?mph during Cyclone Xaver in 2013.[57]\\r\\nThe most rain recorded to fall on a single day was 279?mm at Martinstown (Dorset) on 18 July 1955,[37] but also 243?mm fell at Bruton, Somerset on 28 June 1917.[58] Heavy rain also fell between 20 and 25 June in 2007; some areas experienced a month's rainfall in one day. Four people died in the flooding and over S1.5?billion of damage to businesses and properties was caused.\\r\\nTropical cyclones themselves do not affect the UK due to the seas being too cold ÿ they need temperatures above 26.5?C (79.7?F) to remain active. The waters near the UK, the Atlantic Ocean, only have temperatures of 2 to 18?C (36 to 64?F),[59] so any tropical cyclone that does come anywhere near the UK has said to have undergone a process called extratropical transition. This now means it is an extratropical cyclone, which the UK frequently experiences. The Great Storm of 1987 was a very deep depression which formed in the Bay of Biscay, which also contained the remnants of Hurricane Floyd.[60] Hurricane Lili of 1996 and Hurricane Gordon of 2006 both crossed the UK as strong extratropical cyclones with tropical storm-force winds, causing transport closures, power-cuts and flooding in Northern Ireland, Scotland and South West England. In 2011, the remnants of Hurricane Katia passed over northwestern Scotland with winds near 70?mph (110?km/h).\\r\\nIt is internationally recognised that the United Kingdom has a higher incidence of tornadoes, measured by unit area of land, than any other country in the world. Dr T. Theodore Fujita (inventor of the Fujita scale), an American meteorologist, was the first to recognise the UK as the top site for tornadoes in 1973.[61][62] The United Kingdom has at least 33 tornadoes per year,[63] more than any other country in the world relative to its land area.[64] Although most tornadoes are weak, there are occasional destructive events, for example, the Birmingham tornado of 2005 and the London tornado of 2006. Both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury. The largest ever recorded was thought to have been an F4, again in London in 1091. The most deadly occurred on 28 December 1879. All 74 lives were lost when a passenger train plunged from the Tay Bridge (Tayside) into the Tay Estuary, when the middle section of the bridge collapsed. Although the bridge was poorly constructed and had already been weakened in earlier gales (including the pre-existing winds at the time of the tragedy), the ultimate failure is believed to have been caused by two or three waterspouts which were sighted close to the bridge immediately before the accident.[65] A tornado also developed in London on 3 July 2007.\\r\\nThe UK also holds the title for the highest known 'outbreak' of tornadoes outside of the United States. The largest tornado outbreak in Britain is also the largest tornado outbreak known anywhere in Europe. On 23 November 1981, 105 tornadoes were spawned by a cold front in the space of 5.25 hours. Excepting Derbyshire, every county in a triangular area from Gwynedd to Humberside to Essex was hit by at least one tornado, while Norfolk was hit by at least 13. Very fortunately most tornadoes were short-lived and also weak (the strongest was around T5 on the TORRO Tornado Scale) and no deaths occurred.[65]\\r\\nThe climate of the United Kingdom has not always been the way it is today. During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder. The last glacial period was a period of extreme cold weather that lasted for tens of thousands of years and ended about 10,000 years ago. During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great ice sheet extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of England (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of Wales.\\r\\nThe cold period from the 16th to the mid-19th centuries is known as the Little Ice Age.\\r\\nThe temperature records in England are continuous back to the mid 17th century. The Central England temperature (CET) record is the oldest in the world, and is a compound source of cross-correlated records from several locations in central England. Precipitation records date back to the eighteenth century and the modern England and Wales Precipitation series begins in 1766.\\r\\nA detailed narrative account of the weather of every year from 1913 to 1942, with photographs of plants taken on the same day in each of those years, may be found in Willis (1944).[66]\\r\\nAs with many parts of the world, over the last century the United Kingdom has reported a warming trend in temperatures. While some of this may be due to a recovery from the cooler period of climate mid 20th century (particularly the 1960s) the last 20 years has nonetheless seen an unprecedented level of warm weather. This rise in temperatures is illustrated by the most recent dataset (1981ÿ2010) for Belfast and Cambridge Botanical Gardens, and the same data 50 years previous (1931ÿ1960).\\r\\nAs the above tables show, all months except December at Belfast exhibit warming when both maximum and minimum temperatures are taken into account.\\r\\nAgain, a similar warming trend is shown for the South East of England, albeit slightly more pronounced with no month recording a fall in overall mean temperatures.\\r\\nA disputed temperature of 42?C was set at an airfield in Wisley, Surrey on 18 July 2006. It has been suggested that the reading for this temperature should in fact have been 32?C. It is worth noting that the Met Office expected temperatures to surpass the August 2003 record during the July 2006 heatwave, and it is still speculated that both heatwaves did set higher temperatures than those officially recorded.\\r\\nCentral estimates produced by the Met Office predict average annual temperature to increase by 2?C (4?F) and the warmest summer day to increase by 3?C (6?F) by the 2050s. Average winter rainfall is also likely to increase and most areas will see a slight decrease in annual rainfall.[72]\\r\\nAccording to the Met Office, in the UK, the decade from 2000-2009 was the warmest since instrumental record dating started in 1850.[73]","input":"What type of climate does united kingdom have?"},{"output":"vodka","context":"A Long Island Iced Tea is a type of alcoholic mixed drink typically made with vodka, tequila, light rum, triple sec, gin, and a splash of cola, which gives the drink the same amber hue as its namesake.[1] A popular version mixes equal parts vodka, gin, rum, triple sec, with ?1?1?2 parts sour mix and a splash of cola. Lastly, it is decorated with the lemon and straw, after stirring with bar spoon smoothly.[2]\\r\\nMost variants use equal parts of the main liquors, but include a smaller amount of triple sec (or other orange-flavored liqueur). Close variants often replace the sour mix with lemon juice, replace the cola with diet cola or actual iced tea, or add white crme de menthe. Most variants do not include any tea.\\r\\nThe drink has a much higher alcohol concentration (approximately 22 percent) than most highball drinks due to the relatively small amount of mixer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert \\"Rosebud\\" Butt claims to have invented the Long Island Iced Tea as an entry in a contest to create a new mixed drink with triple sec in 1972 while he worked at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, New York.[3][4][5]\\r\\nA slightly different drink is claimed to have been invented in the 1920s during Prohibition in the United States by an \\"Old Man Bishop\\" in a local community named Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee.[6][7] The drink was then perfected by Ransom Bishop, Old Man Bishop's son. This drink included whiskey and maple syrup, and varied quantities of the five liquors, rather than the modern one with cola and five equal portions of the five liquors.\\r\\nThe popularity of the Long Island has spawned its own family of highballs.[4] Many drinks remain popular in their own right in numerous locales throughout the United States, while owing their existence to the success of the original Long Island Iced Tea. A example of a variation to the Long Island is the Purple Rain, which uses the same mix as a Long Island but the Triple Sec is replaced with a shot of Chambord Liqueur and the cola replaced with lemonlime soda [8]. The Adios Mother is consider a variation of the Long Island Ice Tea or a Blue Hawaiian.[9]","input":"What is in long island iced tea mix?"},{"output":"Soviet Russia","context":"The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was a peace treaty signed on 3 March 1918 between the new Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire), that ended Russia's participation in World War I. The treaty was signed at Brest-Litovsk (Polish: Brze?? Litewski; since 1945 Brest), after two months of negotiations. The treaty was agreed upon by the Bolshevik government to stop further advances by German and Austro-Hungarian forces. According to the treaty, Soviet Russia defaulted on all of Imperial Russia's commitments to the Triple Entente alliance.\\r\\nIn the treaty, Bolshevik Russia ceded the Baltic States to Germany; they were meant to become German vassal states under German princelings.[2] Russia also ceded its province of Kars Oblast in the South Caucasus to the Ottoman Empire and recognized the independence of Ukraine. According to Spencer Tucker, a historian of World War I, \\"The German General Staff had formulated extraordinarily harsh terms that shocked even the German negotiator.\\"[3] Congress Poland was not mentioned in the treaty, as Germans refused to recognize the existence of any Polish representatives, which in turn led to Polish protests.[4] When Germans later complained that the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 was too harsh on them, the Allies (and historians favorable to the Allies) responded that it was more benign than Brest-Litovsk.[5]\\r\\nThe treaty was effectively terminated in November 1918,[6] when Germany surrendered to the Allies. However, in the meantime, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, already fighting the Russian Civil War, by the renouncement of Russia's claims on Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine and Lithuania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1917, Germany and Imperial Russia were stuck in a stalemate on the Eastern Front of World War I and the Russian economy had nearly collapsed under the strain of the war effort. The large numbers of war casualties and persistent food shortages in the major urban centers brought about civil unrest, known as the February Revolution, that forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate. The Russian Provisional Government that replaced the Tsar (initially presided by prince Georgy Lvov, later by Alexander Kerensky), decided to continue the war on the Entente side. Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov sent the Entente Powers a telegram, known as Milyukov note, affirming to them that the Provisional Government would continue the war with the same war aims that Imperial Russia did.\\r\\nThe pro-war Provisional Government was opposed by the self-proclaimed Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, dominated by leftist parties. Its Order No. 1 called for an overriding mandate to soldier committees rather than army officers. The Soviet started to form its own paramilitary power, the Red Guards, in March 1917.\\r\\nThe continuing war led the German Government to agree to a suggestion that they should favor the opposition Communist Party (Bolsheviks), who were proponents of Russia's withdrawal from the war. Therefore, in April 1917, Germany transported Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin and thirty-one supporters in a sealed train from exile in Switzerland to Finland.[7] Upon his arrival in Petrograd, Lenin proclaimed his April Theses, which included a call for turning all political power over to workers' and soldiers' soviets (councils) and an immediate withdrawal of Russia from the war. Throughout 1917, Bolsheviks called for the overthrow of the Provisional Government and an end to the war. Following the disastrous failure of the Kerensky Offensive, discipline in the Russian army deteriorated completely. Soldiers would disobey orders, often under the influence of Bolshevik agitation, and set up soldiers' committees to take control of their units after deposing the officers. Russian and German soldiers occasionally fraternized.\\r\\nThe defeat and ongoing hardships of war led to anti-government riots in Petrograd, the \\"July Days\\" of 1917. Several months later, on 7 November (25 October old style), Red Guards seized the Winter Palace and arrested the Provisional Government in what is known as the October Revolution.\\r\\nA top priority of the newly established Soviet government was to end the war. On 8 November 1917 (26 October 1917 O.S) Vladimir Lenin signed the Decree on Peace, which was approved by the Second Congress of the Soviet of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies. The Decree called \\"upon all the belligerent nations and their governments to start immediate negotiations for peace\\" and proposed an immediate withdrawal of Russia from World War I. Leon Trotsky was appointed Commissar of Foreign Affairs in the new Bolshevik government. In preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers, Leon Trotsky appointed his good friend, Adolph Joffe, to represent the Bolsheviks at the peace conference.\\r\\nOn 15 December 1917, an armistice between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers was concluded. On 22 December, peace negotiations began in Brest-Litovsk.\\r\\nArrangements for the conference were the responsibility of General Max Hoffmann, chief of staff of the Central Power's forces on their Eastern Front (Oberkommando-Ostfront). The delegations that had negotiated the armistice were made stronger. Prominent additions on the Central Power's side were the foreign ministers of Germany Richard von Khlmann and of Austria-Hungary Count Ottokar Czernin, both the Ottoman grand vizier Talat Pasha and Foreign Minister Nassimy Bey. The Bulgarians were headed by Minister of Justice Popoff, who was later joined by Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov. [8] [9]\\r\\nThe Russian delegation was led by Adolph Joffe who had already led their armistice negotiators, but his group was made more cohesive by eliminating most of the representatives of social groups, like peasants and sailors, and the addition of tsarist general Aleksandr Samoilo and the noted Marxist historian Mikhail Pokrovsky. It still included as the representative for women Anastasia Bizenko, who had assassinated a high Imperial official. Again the negotiators met in the fortress in Brest Litovsk, while the delegates were housed in temporary wooden structure in its courtyards, because the city had been burnt to the ground in 1915 by the retreating Russian army. They were cordially welcomed by the commander of the Eastern Front, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, who sat with Joffe on the head table at the opening banquet with one hundred guests. [10] As they had during the armistice negotiations both sides continued to eat dinner and supper together amicably intermingled in the officer's mess.\\r\\nWhen the conference convened Khlmann asked Joffe to present the Russian conditions for peace. He made six points, all variations of the Bolshevik slogan of peace with \\"no annexations or indemnities\\". The Central Powers accepted these principles \\"but only in case all belligerents [including the nations of the Entente] without exception pledge themselves to do the same\\". [11] They did not intend to annex territories occupied by force. Joffe telegraphed this marvelous news to Petrograd. Thanks to informal chatting in the mess, one of Hoffmann's aides, Colonel Friedrich Brinckmann, realized that the Russians had optimistically misinterpreted the Central Power's meaning. [12] It fell to Hoffmann to set matters straight at dinner on 27 December: Poland, Lithuania and Courland, already occupied by the Central Powers, were determined to separate from Russia, on the principle of self-determination that the Bolsheviks themselves espoused. Joffe \\"looked as if he had received a blow on the head\\". [13] Pokrovsky wept as he asked how they could speak of \\"peace without annexations when Germany was tearing eighteen provinces away from the Russian state\\". [14] The Germans and Austro-Hungarian planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, while the Baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by German princes. Czernin was beside himself with this hitch that was slowing the negotiations; self-determination was anathema to his government and they urgently needed grain from the east because Vienna was on the verge of starvation. He proposed to make a separate peace. [15] Khlmann warned that if they negotiated separately Germany would immediately withdraw all its divisions from the Austrian front; Czernin dropped that threat. The food crisis in Vienna was eventually eased by \\"forced drafts of grain from Hungary, Poland, and Romania and by a last moment contribution from Germany of 450 truck-loads of flour\\", [16] At the Russian request they agreed to recess the talks for twelve days.\\r\\nThe Russians only hopes were that given time their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt, so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote \\"To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying\\". [17] Therefore Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader.\\r\\nOn the other side there were significant political realignments. On New Years day in Berlin the Kaiser insisted that Hoffmann reveal his views on the future German-Polish border. He advocated taking a small slice of Poland; Hindenburg and Ludendorff wanted much more. They were furious with Hoffmann for breaching the chain of command and wanted him dismissed and sent to command a division. The Kaiser refused, but Ludendorff no longer spoke with Hoffmann on the telephone, now communication was through an intermediary. [18] The German Supreme Commanders were also furious at ruling out of annexations, contending that the peace \\"must increase Germany's material power\\". [19] They denigrated Khlmann and pressed for additional territorial acquisitions. When Hindenburg was asked why they needed the Baltic states he replied, \\"To secure my left flank for when the next war happens.\\" [20] However the most profound transformation was that a delegation from the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared independence from Russia, had arrived at Brest-Litovsk. They would make peace if they were given the Polish city of Cholm and its surroundings, and then would provide desperately needed grain. Czernin no longer was desperate for a prompt settlement with the Russians.\\r\\nWhen they reconvened Trotsky declined the invitation to meet Prince Leopold and terminated shared meals and other sociable interactions with the representatives of the Central Powers. Day after day Trotsky \\"engaged Khlmann in debate, rising to subtle discussion of first principles that ranged far beyond the concrete territorial issues that divided them\\". [21] The Central Powers signed a peace treaty with the Ukraine during the night of 8-9 February, even though the Russian had retaken Kiev. German and Austro-Hungarian troops entered the Ukraine to prop up the Rada. Finally Hoffmann broke the impasse with the Russians by focusing the discussion on maps of the future boundaries. Trotsky summarized their situation \\"Germany and Austria-Hungary are cutting off from the domains of the former Russian Empire territories more than 150,000 square kilometers in size.\\" [22] He was granted a nine day recess for the Russians to decide whether to sign.\\r\\nIn Petrograd Trotsky argued passionately against signing, proposing that instead \\"they should announce the termination of the war and demobilization without signing any peace.\\" [23] Lenin was for signing rather than having an even more ruinous treaty forced on them after a few more weeks of military humiliation. The \\"Left Communists\\", led by Nikolai Bukharin and Karl Radek, were sure that Germany, Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria were all on the verge of revolution. They wanted to continue the war with a newly-raised revolutionary force while awaiting for these upheavals.[24] Consequently Lenin agreed to Trotsky's formula  a position summed up as \\"no war ÿ no peace\\"  which was announced when the negotiators reconvened on 10 February 1918. The Russians thought their stalling was succeeding until 16 February when Hoffmann notified them that the war would resume in two days, when fifty-three divisions advanced against the near-empty Russian trenches. On the night of 18 February the Central Committee supported Lenin's resolution that they sign the treaty by a margin of seven to five. Hoffmann kept advancing until 23 February when he presented new terms that included the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine and Finland. They were give 48 hours to decide. Lenin told the Central Committee that \\"you must sign this shameful peace in order to save the world revolution\\". [25] If they did not agree he would resign. He was supported by six Central Committee members, opposed by three, with Trotsky and three others abstaining. [26] Trotsky resigned as foreign minister and was replaced by Grigori Sokolnikov.\\r\\nWhen Sokolnikov arrived at Brest-Litovsk he declared \\"we are going to sign immediately the treaty presented to us as an ultimatum but at the same time refuse to enter into any discussion of its terms.\\" [27] The treaty was signed at 17:50 on 3 March, 1918.\\r\\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March 1918. The signatories were Bolshevik Russia signed by Grigori Yakovlovich Sokolnikov on the one side and the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Ottoman Empire on the other.\\r\\nThe treaty marked Russia's final withdrawal from World War I as an enemy of her co-signatories, on severe terms. In all, the treaty took away territory that included a quarter of the population and industry of the former Russian Empire [28] and nine-tenths of its coal mines.[29]\\r\\nRussia renounced all territorial claims in Finland (which it had already acknowledged), Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Belarus, and Ukraine. The territory of the Kingdom of Poland was not mentioned in the treaty, because Russian Poland had been a personal possession of the Tsar, not part of the Empire.\\r\\nThe treaty stated that \\"Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their populations.\\" Most of these territories were in effect ceded to Germany, which intended to have them become economic and political dependencies. The many ethnic German residents (volksdeutsch) would be the ruling elite. New monarchies were created in Lithuania and the United Baltic Duchy (which comprised the modern countries of Latvia and Estonia). The German aristocrats Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach (in Lithuania), and Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (in the United Baltic Duchy), were appointed as rulers.\\r\\nThis plan was detailed by German Colonel General Erich Ludendorff, who wrote, \\"German prestige demands that we should hold a strong protecting hand, not only over German citizens, but over all Germans.\\"[30]\\r\\nThe occupation of Western Russia ultimately proved a costly blunder for Berlin as over one million German troops lay sprawled out from Poland nearly to the Caspian Sea, all idle and depriving Germany of badly needed manpower in France. The hopes of utilizing Ukraine's grain and coal proved abortive and in addition, the local population became increasingly upset at the occupying army. Revolts and guerrilla warfare began breaking out all over the occupied zone, many of them inspired by Bolshevik agents. German troops had to intervene in Finland to put down an attempted Bolshevik coup, and Ludendorff became increasingly paranoid about his troops being affected by propaganda emanating from Moscow; this was one of the reasons he was reluctant to transfer divisions to the Western Front. The attempt at establishing an independent Ukrainian state under German guidance was unsuccessful as well. Despite all this, Ludendorff completely ruled out the idea of marching on Moscow and Petrograd to remove the Bolshevik government from power.\\r\\nGermany transferred hundreds of thousands of veteran troops to the Western Front for the 1918 Spring Offensive, which shocked the Allies badly, but ultimately failed. Some Germans later blamed the occupation for significantly weakening the Spring Offensive.\\r\\nAt the insistence of Talaat Pasha, the treaty declared that the territory Russia took from the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War (1877ÿ1878), specifically Ardahan, Kars, and Batumi, were to be returned. At the time of the treaty, this territory was under the effective control of Armenian and Georgian forces.\\r\\nParagraph 3 of Article IV of the treaty states that:\\r\\nThe districts of Erdehan, Kars, and Batum will likewise and without delay be cleared of Russian troops. Russia will not interfere in the reorganization of the national and international relations of these districts, but leave it to the population of these districts to carry out this reorganization in agreement with the neighboring States, especially with the Ottoman Empire.\\r\\nIn the wake of Russian repudiation of Tsarist bonds, nationalisation of foreign-owned property and confiscation of foreign assets, Russia and Germany signed an additional agreement on 27 August 1918. Russia agreed to pay six billion marks in compensation to German interests for their losses.\\r\\nImmediately after the signing of the treaty, Lenin moved the Soviet Russian government from Petrograd to Moscow.[31] Trotsky blamed the peace treaty on the bourgeoisie, the social revolutionaries,[32] Tsarist diplomats, Tsarist bureaucrats, \\"the Kerenskys, Tseretelis and Chernovs\\"[33] the Tsarist regime, and the \\"petty-bourgeois compromisers\\".[34]\\r\\nRelations between Russia and the victors did not go smoothly. The Ottoman Empire broke the treaty by invading the newly created First Republic of Armenia in May 1918. Joffe became the Russian ambassador to Germany. His priority was distributing propaganda to trigger the German revolution. On 4 November 1918 \\"the Soviet courier's packing-case had 'come to pieces'\\" in a Berlin railway station; [35] it was filled with insurrectionary documents. Joffe and his staff were ejected from Germany in a sealed train on 5 November 1918. In the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I, one clause abrogated the Brest-Litovsk treaty. Next the Bolshevik legislature (VTsIK) annulled the treaty on 13 November 1918, and the text of the VTsIK Decision was printed in Pravda newspaper the next day. In the year after the armistice following a timetable set by the victors the German Army withdrew its occupying forces from the lands gained in Brest-Litovsk. The fate of the region, and the location of the eventual western border of the Soviet Union, was settled in violent and chaotic struggles over the course of the next three and a half years. The PolishÿSoviet War was particularly bitter; it ended with the Treaty of Riga in 1921. Although most of Ukraine fell under Bolshevik control and eventually became one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, Poland and the Baltic states emerged as independent countries. In the Treaty of Rapallo, concluded in April 1922, Germany accepted the Treaty's nullification, and the two powers agreed to abandon all war-related territorial and financial claims against each other. This state of affairs lasted until 1939. As a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union advanced its borders westward by invading Poland in September 1939 and taking a small part of Finland in November 1939 and annexing the Baltic States, Eastern Poland and Bessarabia in 1940. It thus overturned almost all the territorial losses incurred at Brest-Litovsk, except for the main part of Finland, western Congress Poland, and western Armenia.\\r\\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk marked a significant contraction of the territory controlled by the Bolsheviks and damaged their claim to bs effective successors of the Russian Empire. While the independence of Finland and Poland was already accepted by them in principle,[citation needed] the loss of Ukraine and the Baltics created, from the Bolshevik perspective, dangerous bases of anti-Bolshevik military activity in the subsequent Russian Civil War (1918ÿ1922). Indeed, many Russian nationalists and some revolutionaries were furious at the Bolsheviks' acceptance of the treaty and joined forces to fight them. Non-Russians who inhabited the lands lost by Bolshevik Russia in the treaty saw the changes as an opportunity to set up independent states.\\r\\nFor the Western Allies, the terms that Germany imposed on Russia were interpreted as a warning of what to expect if Germany and the other Central Powers won the war. Between Brest-Litovsk and the point when the German military situation in the west became dire, some officials in the German government and high command began to favor offering more lenient terms to the Allies in exchange for their recognition of German gains in the east.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe maps show that Russia's post-1991 western border bears a marked similarity to that imposed by the Brest-Litovsk treaty.[citation needed]\\r\\nEmil Orlik, the Viennese Secessionist artist, attended the conference, at the invitation of Richard von Khlmann. He drew portraits of all the participants, along with a series of smaller caricatures. These were gathered together into a book, Brest-Litovsk, a copy of which was given to each of the participants.[36]","input":"Who was involved in the treaty of brest-litovsk?"},{"output":"51,634","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Thomas  (Danish: Sankt Thomas) is one of the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea and, together with Saint John, Water Island and Saint Croix, a former Danish colony, form a county and constituent district of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an unincorporated territory of the United States. Located on the island is the territorial capital and port of Charlotte Amalie. As of the 2010 census, the population of Saint Thomas was 51,634[2] about 48.5% of the US Virgin Islands total. The district has a land area of 32 square miles (83?km2).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island was originally settled around 1500 BC by the Ciboney people. They were later replaced by the Arawaks and then the Caribs. Christopher Columbus sighted the island in 1493 on his second voyage to the \\"New World\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch West India Company established a post on Saint Thomas in 1657. The first congregation was the St. Thomas Reformed Church, which was established in 1660 and was associated with the Dutch Reformed Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenmark-Norway conquered the island in 1666, and by 1672 had established control over the entire island through the Danish West India and Guinea Company. The land was divided into plantations and sugarcane production became the primary economic activity. As a result, the economies of Saint Thomas and the neighboring islands of Saint John and Saint Croix became highly dependent on slave labor and the slave trade. In 1685, the Brandenburgisch-Africanische Compagnie took control of the slave trade on Saint Thomas, and for some time the largest slave auctions in the world were held there.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Thomas's fine natural harbor became known as \\"Taphus\\" for the drinking establishments located nearby. (\\"Tap Hus\\" translates as \\"rum shop\\" or \\"tap house\\" referring to the drinking establishments.[4]) In 1691, the primary settlement there was renamed Charlotte Amalie in honor of the wife of Denmark's King Christian V. It was later declared a free port by Frederick V. In December 1732, the first two of many Moravian Brethren missionaries came from Herrnhut Saxony in present-day Germany to minister to them. Distrusted at first by the white masters, they lived among the slaves and soon won their confidence.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1796 a small Jewish community developed in Charlotte Amalie. It established a historic synagogue, Beracha Veshalom Vegmiluth Hasidim, the oldest synagogue in continuous use anywhere in the United States or its external territories.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first British invasion and occupation of the Danish West Indies occurred at the end of March 1801 when a British fleet arrived at St Thomas. Denmark-Norway accepted the Articles of Capitulation the British proposed and the British occupied the islands without a shot being fired. The British occupation lasted until April 1802, when the British returned the islands to Denmark-Norway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second British invasion of the Danish West Indies took place in December 1807 when a British fleet captured St Thomas on 22 December and Santa Cruz on 25 December. Denmark-Norway did not resist and the invasion was bloodless. This British occupation of the Danish West Indies lasted until 20 November 1815, when Britain returned the islands to Denmark.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the sugar trade had brought prosperity to the island's free citizens, by the early 19th century Saint Thomas was in decline. The continued export of sugar was threatened by hurricanes, drought, and American competition. Following the Danish Revolution of 1848, slavery was abolished and the resulting rise in labor costs further weakened the position of Saint Thomas's sugar producers.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven its harbors and fortifications, Saint Thomas still retained a strategic importance, and thus, in the 1860s, during the American Civil War and its aftermath, the United States government considered buying the island and its neighbors from Denmark for $7.5 million. However, the proponents of the purchase failed to gain legislative support for the bid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the islands were poorly managed by the Danes[citation needed], a local islander, David Hamilton Jackson, was instrumental in persuading the Danish to allow the US to purchase the islands of Saint Thomas, Saint John, and Saint Croix. In 1915, he traveled to Denmark and convinced the King of Denmark to allow freedom of the press in the islands.[7] He began the first newspaper in the islands, known as The Herald. After this, he organized labor unions among the islanders for better working conditions. The islands now have an annual celebration in November to honor the legacy of David Hamilton Jackson.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, Saint Thomas was purchased (along with Saint John and Saint Croix) by the United States for $25 million in gold,[9] as part of a defensive strategy to maintain control over the Caribbean and the Panama Canal during the First World War. The transfer occurred on March 31, 1917, behind Fort Christian before the barracks that now house the Legislature of the U.S Virgin Islands. The baccalaureate service for the transfer was held at the St. Thomas Reformed Church as it was identified as the American church in the Danish West Indies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States granted citizenship to the residents in 1927. The U.S. Department of the Interior took over administrative duties in 1931. American forces were based on the island during the Second World War. In 1954, passage of the U.S. Virgin Islands Organic Act officially granted territorial status to the three islands, and allowed for the formation of a local senate with politics dominated by the American Republican and Democratic parties. Full home rule was achieved in 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe post-war era also saw the rise of tourism on the island. With relatively cheap air travel and the American embargo on Cuba, the numbers of visitors greatly increased. Despite natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo (1989) and Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn (1995), the island's infrastructure continues to improve as the flow of visitors continues. Hotels have been built from the West End to the East End.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island has a number of natural bays and harbors including Magens Bay, Great Bay, Jersey Bay, Long Bay, Fortuna Bay, and Hendrik Bay. Passenger ships dock and anchor in Long Bay, near Charlotte Amalie. Ships dock at Havensight Pier.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Thomas is divided into the following subdistricts (with population as per the 2010 U.S. Census):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island is serviced by the Cyril E.

This was inherited from what was the then-current Danish practice at the time of the American acquisition in 1917. However, because Saint Thomas is a U.S. territory, most cars are imported from the mainland United States and therefore the steering column is located on the left side of the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island has many regular taxis from compact size to large vans, as well as open-air, covered trucks called \\"safaris\\" with bench seats.

Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.[2][3] Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were authors of The Federalist Papers, advocating ratification of the Constitution. The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York (1777) and Massachusetts (1780) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution.[4] Jay, Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1783) that would end the American Revolutionary War.[5] Washington was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention. All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States, with Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison serving as President. Jay was the nation's first Chief Justice, Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury, and Franklin was America's most senior diplomat, and later the governmental leader of Pennsylvania.\\r\\nThe term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to the Signers of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.[6] Signers should not be confused with the term Framers; the Framers are defined by the National Archives as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States. Of the 55 Framers, only 39 were signers of the Constitution.[7][8] Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include: 1) those who signed the Continental Association, a trade ban and one of the colonists' first collective volleys protesting British control and the Intolerable Acts in 1774[9] or 2) those who signed the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S. constitutional document.[10]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Founding Fathers\\" is a twentieth-century appellation, coined by Warren G. Harding in 1916. Prior to, and during the 19th century, they were referred to as simply the \\"Fathers\\". The term has been used to describe the founders and first settlers of the original royal colonies.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Continental Congress met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of fifty-six delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies (excluding Georgia) that became the United States of America. Among them was George Washington, who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Also in attendance was Patrick Henry, and John Adams, who like all delegates were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included Samuel Adams from Massachusetts, John Dickinson from Pennsylvania and New York's John Jay. This congress in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the Continental Association to administer boycott actions against Britain.\\r\\nWhen the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.[13] New arrivals included Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, John Hancock of Massachusetts, and John Witherspoon of New Jersey. Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when Peyton Randolph was recalled to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses. Thomas Jefferson replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.[14] The second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the Articles of Confederation and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.[15]\\r\\nThe newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the British Parliament. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the Congress of the Confederation, which met from 1781 to 1789.[16] The Constitutional Convention took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.[17] Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset for some including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the United States Constitution and the replacement of the Continental Congress with the United States Congress.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th-century U.S. leadership. Almost all of them were well-educated men of means who were leaders in their communities. Many were also prominent in national affairs. Virtually every one had taken part in the American Revolution; at least 29 had served in the Continental Army, most of them in positions of command. Scholars have examined the collective biography of them as well as the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution.[18]\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers attended or held degrees from the colonial colleges, most notably Columbia known at the time as \\"King's College\\", Princeton originally known as \\"The College of New Jersey\\", Harvard College, the College of William and Mary, Yale College and University of Pennsylvania. Some had previously been home schooled or obtained early instruction from private tutors or academies.[19] Others had studied abroad. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin who had little formal education himself would ultimately establish the College of Philadelphia based on European models (1740); \\"Penn\\" would have the first medical school (1765) in the thirteen colonies where another Founder, Benjamin Rush would eventually teach.\\r\\nWith a limited number of professional schools established in the U.S., Founders also sought advanced degrees from traditional institutions in England and Scotland such as the University of Edinburgh, the University of St. Andrews, and the University of Glasgow.\\r\\nSeveral like John Jay, James Wilson, John Williams and George Wythe[24] were trained as lawyers through apprenticeships in the colonies while a few trained at the Inns of Court in London.\\r\\nFranklin, Washington, John Williams and Henry Wisner had little formal education and were largely self-taught or learned through apprenticeship.\\r\\nSome of the Founding Fathers were natives of the Thirteen Colonies.\\r\\nAt least nine were born outside of the Thirteen Colonies\\r\\nMany of them had moved from one state to another. Eighteen had already lived, studied or worked in more than one state or colony: Baldwin, Bassett, Bedford, Davie, Dickinson, Few, Franklin, Ingersoll, Hamilton, Livingston, Alexander Martin, Luther Martin, Mercer, Gouverneur Morris, Robert Morris, Read, Sherman, and Williamson.\\r\\nSeveral others had studied or traveled abroad.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers practiced a wide range of high and middle-status occupations, and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. They did not differ dramatically from the Loyalists, except they were generally younger and less senior in their professions.[25]\\r\\nHistorian Caroline Robbins in 1977 examined the status of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence and concluded:\\r\\nSeveral of the Founding Fathers had extensive national, state, local and foreign political experience prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1787. Some had been diplomats. Several had been members of the Continental Congress or elected President of that body.\\r\\nNearly all of the 55 Constitutional Convention delegates had some experience in colonial and state government, and the majority had held county and local offices.[30] Those who lacked national congressional experience were Bassett, Blair, Brearly, Broom, Davie, Dayton, Alexander Martin, Luther Martin, Mason, McClurg, Paterson, Charles Pinckney, Strong, and Yates.\\r\\nFranklin T. Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of some of the Founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 28 were Anglicans (in the Church of England; or Episcopalian, after the American Revolutionary War was won), 21 were Protestants, and two were Roman Catholics (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons).[31] Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists.[31]\\r\\nA few prominent Founding Fathers were anti-clerical Christians such as Thomas Jefferson,[32][33][34] who constructed the Jefferson Bible, and Benjamin Franklin.[35]\\r\\nHistorian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders (Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington) were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid \\"theistic rationalism\\".[36]\\r\\nThe Faiths of the Founding Fathers is a book that discusses the religion held by the founding fathers, written in 2006 by historian of U.S. religion David L. Holmes.\\r\\nOne of the greatest contradictions of the Founding Fathers was their disunity with regard to slavery at a time that they were seeking liberty for themselves. This hypocrisy was as evident in the North as it was in the South for many wealthy Northerners owned domestic slaves. In her study of Thomas Jefferson, historian Annette Gordon-Reed emphasizes this irony, \\"Others of the founders held slaves, but no other founder drafted the charter for freedom, \\"[37] In addition to Jefferson, George Washington, John Jay and many other of the Founding Fathers practiced slavery but were also conflicted by the institution which many saw as immoral and politically divisive.[38]\\r\\nFranklin, though he was a key founder of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society[39] originally owned slaves whom he later manumitted. John Jay would try unsuccessfully to abolish slavery as early as 1777 in the State of New York.[40] He nonetheless founded the New York Manumission Society in 1785, for which Hamilton became an officer. They and other members of the Society founded the African Free School in New York City, to educate the children of free blacks and slaves. It was not until Jay was governor of New York in 1798, that he signed into law a gradual abolition law; fully ending slavery as of 1827. He freed his own slaves in 1798. Alexander Hamilton opposed slavery, as his experiences in life left him very familiar with slavery and its effect on slaves and on slaveholders,[41] although he did negotiate slave transactions for his wife's family, the Schuylers.[42] John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Paine never owned slaves.[43]\\r\\nSlaves and slavery are mentioned only indirectly in the 1787 Constitution. For example, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 prescribes that \\"three fifths of all other Persons\\" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and direct taxes. Additionally, in Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3, slaves are referred to as \\"persons held in service or labor\\".[39][44] The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.[44] In 1782 Virginia passed a manumission law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.[45] As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.[45] Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.[44] Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, for lands north of the Ohio River.[44]\\r\\nThe international slave trade was banned in all states except South Carolina, by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave.[46] However, the domestic slave trade was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory.[47]\\r\\nIn the winter and spring of 1786ÿ1787, twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates; for example, Patrick Henry of Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and important than national politics, though during the ratification controversy of 1787ÿ1788 he claimed, \\"I smelled a rat.\\" Rhode Island did not send delegates because of its politicians' suspicions of the Convention delegates' motivations. As the colony was founded by Roger Williams as a sanctuary for Baptists, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.[48]\\r\\nMost of the Founding Fathers married and had children. Many of their spouses, like Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Sarah Livingston Jay, Dolley Madison, Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer were strong women and made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.[49]\\r\\nSherman fathered the largest family: 15 children by two wives. At least nine (Bassett, Brearly, Johnson, Mason, Paterson, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) married more than once. Four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of the delegates also had children conceived illegitimately.[50] George Washington, \\"The Father of our Country,\\"[51] had no biological descendants.\\r\\nThe National Archives and Records Administration also known as NARA, defines U.S. Founding Documents, or Charters of Freedom, as the Declaration of Independence (1776), The Constitution (1787) and the Bill of Rights (1791). These original instruments which represent the philosophy of the United States are housed in Washington, D.C. in the NARA Rotunda.[52] The Library of Congress further identifies the Articles of Confederation, also preserved at NARA, as a primary U.S. document.[53] The Articles of Confederation served as the first constitution of the United States until its replacement by the present Constitution on March 4, 1789.\\r\\nSignatories of the Continental Association (CA), Declaration of Independence (DI), Articles of Confederation (AC), and the United States Constitution (USC)):\\r\\nSubsequent events in the lives of the Founding Fathers after the adoption of the Constitution were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.[54] Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison served in highest U.S. office of President. Jay would be appointed as Chief Justice of the United States and later elected to two terms as Governor of New York.\\r\\nSeven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.[49] Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: James Armistead Lafayette was 15, Marquis de Lafayette was 18, Alexander Hamilton was 19, Aaron Burr was 20, Gouverneur Morris and Betsy Ross were 24. The oldest were Benjamin Franklin, 70, and Samuel Whittemore, 81.[55]\\r\\nSecretary Charles Thomson lived to the age of 94. Johnson died at 92. John Adams lived to the age of 90. A few ÿ Franklin, Jay, Jefferson, Madison, Hugh Williamson, and George Wythe ÿ lived into their eighties. Approximately 16 died in their seventies, 21 in their sixties, 8 in their fifties, and 5 in their forties. Three (Alexander Hamilton, Richard Dobbs Spaight and Button Gwinnett) were killed in duels.\\r\\nFriends and political adversaries John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on the same day ÿ July 4, 1826.[56]\\r\\nThe last remaining founders, also called the \\"Last of the Romans\\", lived well into the nineteenth century.[57]\\r\\nThe following men and women are also recognized by many as having been founders of the United States, based upon their contributions to the formation of American nation and democracy.\\r\\nSeveral Founding Fathers were instrumental in establishing schools and societal institutions that still exist today:\\r\\nArticles and books by twenty-first century historians combined with the digitization of primary sources like handwritten letters continue to contribute to an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the Founding Fathers.\\r\\nRon Chernow won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of George Washington. His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster musical of the same name.\\r\\nJoseph J. Ellis ÿ According to Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says \\"the founders\\", or \\"the fathers\\", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s ÿ men like Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun ÿ \\"the founders\\" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.\\r\\nWe can win no laurels in a war for independence,\\" Webster acknowledged in 1825. \\"Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are there places for us?... [as] the founders of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation.[87]\\r\\nJoanne B. Freeman Freeman's area of expertise is the life and legacy of Alexander Hamilton as well as political culture of the revolutionary and early national eras.[88][89][90] Freeman has documented the often opposing visions of the Founding Fathers as they tried to build a new framework for governance, \\"Regional distrust, personal animosity, accusation, suspicion, implication, and denouncementthis was the tenor of national politics from the outset.\\" [91]\\r\\nAnnette Gordon-Reed is an American historian and Harvard Law School professor. She is noted for changing scholarship on Thomas Jefferson regarding his relationship with Sally Hemings and her children. She has studied the challenges facing the Founding Fathers particularly as it relates to their position and actions on slavery.

The country has also been an associate member of the Western European Union from 1992 to its end in 2011. Turkey signed a Customs Union agreement with the EU in 1995 and was officially recognised as a candidate for full membership on 12 December 1999, at the Helsinki summit of the European Council.\\r\\nNegotiations for full membership were started on 3 October 2005.[5] Progress was slow, and out of the 35 Chapters necessary to complete the accession process only 16 had been opened and one had been closed by May 2016.[6] The early 2016 refugee deal between Turkey and the European Union was intended to accelerate negotiations after previous stagnation and as allow visa-free travel through Europe for Turks.[7]\\r\\nTurkish accession talks came to a halt as a result of the 2016ÿ17 purges in Turkey. On 24 November 2016 the European Parliament voted to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey over human rights and rule of law concerns,[8] though this decision was not binding.[9] On 13 December, the Council of the European Union (comprising the ministers of the member states) resolved that it would open no new areas in Turkey's membership talks in the \\"prevailing circumstances\\",[10] as Turkeys path toward autocratic rule made progress on EU accession impossible.[11] As of 2017, and especially following the passage of the constitutional referendum, Turkish accession talks have effectively stopped.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Ottoman Empire's collapse following World War I, Turkish revolutionaries led by Mustafa Kemal Atatrk emerged victorious in the Turkish War of Independence, establishing the modern Turkish Republic as it exists today. Atatrk, President of Turkey, implemented a series of reforms, including secularisation and industrialisation, intended to \\"Europeanise\\" or Westernise the country.[14] During World War II, Turkey remained neutral until February 1945, when it joined the Allies. The country took part in the Marshall Plan of 1947, became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949,[15] and a member of NATO in 1952.[16] During the Cold War, Turkey allied itself with the United States and Western Europe. The Turkish expert Meltem Ah?ska outlines the Turkish position vis--vis Europe, explaining how Europe has been an object of desire as well as a source of frustration for Turkish national identity in a long and strained history.[17]\\r\\nThe country first applied for associate membership in the European Economic Community in 1959, and on 12 September 1963 signed the \\"Agreement Creating An Association Between The Republic of Turkey and the European Economic Community\\", also known as the Ankara Agreement. This agreement came into effect the following year on 12 December 1964. The Ankara Agreement sought to integrate Turkey into a customs union with the EEC whilst acknowledging the final goal of membership.[14] In November 1970, a further protocol called the \\"Additional Protocol\\" established a timetable for the abolition of tariffs and quotas on goods traded between Turkey and the EEC.[14]\\r\\nOn 14 April 1987, Turkey submitted its application for formal membership into the European Economic Community. The European Commission responded in December 1989 by confirming Ankaras eventual membership but also by deferring the matter to more favourable times, citing Turkeys economic and political situation, as well its poor relations with Greece and the conflict with Cyprus as creating an unfavourable environment with which to begin negotiations.[18] This position was confirmed again in the Luxembourg European Council of 1997 in which accession talks were started with central and eastern European states and Cyprus, but not Turkey. During the 1990s, Turkey proceeded with a closer integration with the European Union by agreeing to a customs union in 1995. Moreover, the Helsinki European Council of 1999 proved a milestone as the EU recognised Turkey as a candidate on equal footing with other potential candidates.\\r\\nThe next significant step in TurkeyÿEU relations came with the December 2002 Copenhagen European Council.[19] According to it, \\"the EU would open negotiations with Turkey 'without delay' if the European Council in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation from the Commission, decides that Turkey fulfills the Copenhagen political criteria.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe European Commission recommended that the negotiations should begin in 2005, but also added various precautionary measures. The EU leaders agreed on 16 December 2004 to start accession negotiations with Turkey from 3 October 2005.[20] While Austria and Germany initially wanted to leave open the possibility that negotiations with Turkey would lead to a privileged partnership, less than full membership, accession negotiations were ultimately launched with the \\"shared objective\\" of membership.[21]\\r\\nTurkey's accession talks have since been stalled by a number of domestic and external problems. Both Austria and France have said they would hold a referendum on Turkey's accession. In the case of France, a change in its Constitution was made to impose such a referendum, but later another constitutional change has enabled the parliament (if a large majority of its members agrees) to prevent such a referendum.[22] The issue of Cyprus continues to be a major obstacle to negotiations.[23] European officials have commented on the slowdown in Turkish reforms which, combined with the Cyprus problem, led the EUs Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in March 2007 to warn of an impending train crash in the negotiations.[24] Due to these setbacks, negotiations again came to a halt in December 2006, with the EU freezing talks in 8 of the 35 key areas under negotiation.[25]\\r\\nIn December 2009, the Republic of Cyprus blocked 6 chapters of Turkish accession negotiations, including those on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, Energy and Education and Culture, arguing that Turkey needs to first normalise relations with Cyprus.[26][27] As a result, no chapter have been opened since June 2010.[28][29][30] Hence, there is no chapter Turkey can open other than the difficult and economically detrimental chapters Competition Policy, Social Policy and Employment, and Public Procurement that most candidate countries open at the end of accession as all other chapters are blocked. In February 2013, Turkish Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry for EU Affairs, Burak Erdenir, claimed that the EU had yet to communicate to Turkey the benchmark criteria for opening chapters 23 and 24, Judiciary & Fundamental Rights and Justice, Freedom & Security, which was to be done after screening of the chapters was completed in 2006, thus making it impossible to comply with them. He also suggested this was a deliberate attempt to slow their accession process.[31]\\r\\nAfter over 2 years of no chapter openings, the European Commission set up a \\"Positive agenda\\" designed to focus on common EU-Turkey interests. EU Commissioner for expansion Stefan Fle describes that the goal was \\"to keep the accession process alive and put it properly back on track after a period of stagnation which has been a source of frustration for both sides.\\"[32] The EU Commission mentioned a broad range of areas as the main elements of the Agenda such as intensified dialogue and cooperation on political reforms, visa, mobility and migration, energy, fight against terrorism, further participation of Turkey in Community programmes, town twinning, trade and the Customs Union and supporting efforts to align with the acquis, including on chapters where accession negotiations cannot be opened for the time being. The proposal was considered favorably on the condition that it serves as an instrument in support of and complementary to the negotiation process with the EU.\\r\\nIn the framework of Positive Agenda, Working Groups were established on 8 chapters (3-Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services, 6-Company Law, 10-Information Society and Media, 18-Statistics, 23-Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, 24-Justice, Freedom and Security, 28-Consumer and Health Protection and 32-Financial Control). The Positive Agenda kick-off meeting was held on 17 May 2012 in Ankara with the participation of Stefan Fle, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy. As a result of the Working Groups meetings held so far, a total of four closing benchmarks were confirmed to have been met by Turkey in three chapters (Company Law, Consumer and Health Protection and Financial Control chapters).[33][34]\\r\\nIn 2007, Turkey stated that they were aiming to comply with EU law by 2013,[35] but Brussels refused to back that as a deadline for membership.[36] In 2006 European Commission President Jos Manuel Barroso said that the accession process will take at least until 2021.[37] In a visit to Germany on 31 October 2012, Turkish Prime Minister R.T. Erdo?an made clear that Turkey was expecting membership in the Union to be realised by 2023, the 100th Anniversary of the Turkish Republic, implying that they could end membership negotiations if the talks had not yielded a positive result by then.[38] Turkish President Abdullah Gl said that upon completing the accession process Turkey will hold a referendum for Turkish membership in the European Union.[39]\\r\\nOn 20 June 2013, in the wake of Ankara's crackdown on mass demonstrations in Taksim Square, Germany blocked the start to new EU accession talks with Turkey.[40] According to the Financial Times, one Turkish official said that such a move could potentially break off political relations with the bloc.[40]\\r\\nA Eurobarometer poll in September 2013, which included EU countries and candidate countries as well, showed that 43% of Turks viewed the EU positively, as compared with 60% six months previously. In the same poll, 29% of Turks polled expressed support for an EU Constitution, the lowest level of support among EU countries and candidates polled.[41] Germany says that its reservation stems from a technical issue, but Angela Merkel, an opponent of Turkish entry into the EU, has described herself as \\"shocked\\" after Ankara's use of overwhelming police force against mostly peaceful demonstrators.[40] France stated that they would not waive their veto over unfreezing four accession chapters with Turkey until after elections for the European Parliament in June 2014.[42]\\r\\nThe crackdown following the 2016 Turkish coup d'tat attempt by President Erdogan damaged relations with the EU. Erdogan has indicated his approval of reinstating the death penalty to punish those involved in the coup, with the EU suggesting that this would end its EU ambitions. Erdogan stated in November 2016 that he was considering putting Turkey's continued negotiations with the EU on membership to a referendum in 2017.[43] In November 2016, the European Parliament voted in favour of a non-binding resolution to request that the European Commission temporarily suspend membership negotiations due to the \\"disproportionate repressive measures\\" of the government to the coup.[44] On 13 December, the European Council (comprising the heads of state or government of the member states) resolved that it would open no new areas in Turkey's membership talks in the \\"prevailing circumstances\\";[10] Turkeys path toward autocratic rule makes progress on EU accession impossible.[11]\\r\\nIn April 2017, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted to reopen its monitoring procedure against Turkey. This vote is widely understood to deal a major blow to Turkey*s perspective of eventual EU membership, as exiting that process was made a precondition of EU accession negotiations back in 2004.[45]\\r\\nTo accede to the EU, Turkey must successfully complete negotiations with the European Commission on 33 of the 35 chapters of the acquis communautaire, the total body of EU law. (Two chapters do not require negotiation.) Afterwards, the member states must unanimously agree on granting Turkey membership to the European Union.\\r\\nUntil the accession process is terminated, Turkey receives payments from the EU budget as pre-accession support, currently 4.5 billion allocated budget for the 2014-2020 period (about 740 million Euros per year).[73]\\r\\nIn June 2017, the EU's financial watchdog, the European Court of Auditors, said it would start to probe how almost 1 billion Euro EU funds which Turkey received since 2007 to support rule of law, civil society, fundamental rights, democracy and governance were actually spent.[74] Turkish media commented that \\"perhaps it can explain why this money apparently failed to have the slightest effect on efforts to prevent the deterioration of democracy in this country.\\"[75]\\r\\nThe problem of Turkey's membership of the EU is compounded by conflicting views as to what the EU should ultimately become.[76] This has played a significant role in the debate, due in part to the Eurozone crisis and the fact that as a result of this the eurozone and the EU overall is more federalised on both fiscal, legal and political levels than it was at the time of Turkey's application or at the time that Turkey was accepted as a candidate.[77] Generally those members of the EU who support a rights-based free trade bloc do not oppose Turkey as adamantly as those who support a broader political union. The latter, in particular, are concerned that unification would be frustrated and the European project threatened by Turkey's inclusion.[78]\\r\\nProponents of Turkey's membership argue that it is a key regional power[80][81] with a large economy and the second-largest military force of NATO after the United States[82][83] that will enhance the EU's position as a global geostrategic player and its Common Foreign and Security Policy;[84] given Turkey's geographic location and economic, political, cultural and historic ties in regions with large natural resources that are at the immediate vicinity of the EU's geopolitical sphere of influence; such as the East Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts, the Middle East, the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia.[85][86]\\r\\nAccording to the former Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, \\"the accession of Turkey would give the EU a decisive role for stability in the eastern part of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, which is clearly in the strategic interest of Europe.\\"[87] Two of Turkey's key supporters for its bid to join the EU are Poland[88][89] and the United Kingdom.[90][citation needed].\\r\\nUpon joining the EU, Turkey's 76 million inhabitants would bestow the second-largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament.[24] Demographic projections indicate that Turkey would surpass Germany by 2020.[24] However, as a single country can only hold a maximum of 96 seats in the European Parliament, this would not give Turkey an advantage in the European Parliament.\\r\\nTurkey's membership would also affect future enlargement plans, especially the number of nations seeking EU membership,[24] grounds on which Valry Giscard d'Estaing has opposed Turkey's admission. Giscard has suggested that it would lead to demands for accession by Morocco. Morocco's application is already rejected on geographic grounds; Turkey, unlike Morocco, has 3% of its territory in Europe. On the other hand, Cyprus, which is geographically located in Asia, joined the European Union in 2004. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated in January 2007 that \\"enlarging Europe with no limit risks destroying European political union, and that I do not accept...I want to say that Europe must give itself borders, that not all countries have a vocation to become members of Europe, beginning with Turkey which has no place inside the European Union.\\"[91]\\r\\nEU member states must unanimously agree on Turkey's membership for the Turkish accession to be successful. In December 2011, a poll showed that as much as 71% of the participants surveyed in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom were opposed to Turkey's membership in the European Union.[92] A number of nations may oppose it; notably Austria (which historically served as a bulwark for Christian Europe against the Ottoman Empire whose armies twice laid siege to Vienna in 1529 and 1683); Germany (chancellor Angela Merkel has long rejected Turkey's accession bid, and has proposed a \\"privileged partnership\\" instead);[93] and France (where some are anxious at the prospect of a new wave of Muslim immigrants, given the country's already large Muslim community.)[94]\\r\\nNegotiations to remove the French constitutional requirement for a compulsory referendum on all EU accessions after Croatia resulted in a new proposal to require a compulsory referendum on the accession of any country with a population of more than 5% of the EU's total population; this clause would mainly apply to Turkey and Ukraine.[95] The French Senate, however, blocked the change in the French constitution, in order to maintain good relations with Turkey.[96] The current situation according to the French constitution is as follows: if 3/5 of the delegates (from the Senate and the Parliament) agree to the accession of Turkey, there will be no referendum.\\r\\nUpon accession to the EU, Turkey expects to receive economic development aid similar to what Ireland, Greece and Portugal received.[citation needed] There is also an expectation that there will be an increase in European foreign investment in the Turkish economy, further driving economic growth. Additionally, in times of economic crisis, Turkey could expect economic assistance from the EU,[citation needed] similar to what Ireland, Greece and Portugal received after the 2008 financial crisis.\\r\\nFree movement of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to easily migrate to other parts of Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of living will tend to cool separatist tendencies. Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe. The EU accession bid has stimulated Turkey's political and legal reforms and intensified the democratisation process.[97]\\r\\nGiven Turkey's large and growing population, Turkey will have a correspondingly large representation in the European Parliament. This will give Turkey strong direct influence over EU policies. Membership in the EU will also increase Turkey's prestige regionally and internationally.\\r\\nTurkey has the world's 17th largest GDP-PPP[98] and 18th largest Nominal GDP.[99] The country is a founding member of the OECD and the G-20 major economies.\\r\\nTurkey has taken advantage of a customs union with the European Union, signed in 1995, to increase its industrial production destined for exports, while at the same time benefiting from EU-origin foreign investment into the country.[100] In 2008, Turkey's exports reached 141.8 billion USD[101] (main export partners: Germany 11.2%, UK 8%, Italy 6.95%, France 5.6%, Spain 4.3%, US 3.88%; total EU exports 56.5%.) However, larger imports amounting to about 204.8 billion USD[101] threaten the balance of trade (main import partners: Russia 13.8%, Germany 10.3%, China 7.8%, Italy 6%, USA 4.8%, France 4.6%, Iran 3.9%, UK 3.2%; total EU imports 40.4%; total Asia imports 27%).[102][103]\\r\\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Istanbul had a total of 37 billionaires in 2013, ranking 5th in the world behind Moscow (84 billionaires), New York City (62 billionaires), Hong Kong (43 billionaires) and London (43 billionaires).[104]\\r\\nThe opening of talks regarding the Economic and Monetary Policy acquis chapter of Turkey's accession bid was expected to begin in June 2007, but were stalled by France.[105] Turkey became the European Unions fifth-largest trade partner in 2015 according to data released by Eurostat.[106]\\r\\nTurkey is set to receive EUR 9.2bn from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, a funding mechanism for EU candidate countries.\\r\\nAs of 2005[update], the population of Turkey stood at 71.5 million with a yearly growth rate of 1.5%.[107][108] The Turkish population is relatively young, with 25.5% falling within the 0ÿ15 age bracket.[109]\\r\\nTurkey's large population would alter the balance of power in the representative European institutions. Upon joining the EU, Turkey's 78 million inhabitants would bestow it the second largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament.[110][not in citation given] Demographic projections indicate that Turkey's population will surpass Germany's by 2020. This means Turkey would get the maximal number of representatives in the European Parliament, equal to Germany's.[110][not in citation given][dubious ÿ discuss]\\r\\nIstanbul will become the largest metropolis in the European Union if Turkey successfully completes the accession negotiations.\\r\\nCyprus was divided when, on 20 July 1974, Turkey occupied a third of the island in response to an Athens-engineered coup aimed at annexing Cyprus to Greece.[111][112] Since then, Turkey has refused to acknowledge the Republic of Cyprus (an EU member since 2004) as the sole authority on the island, and recognizes the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus since its establishment in 1983. The Turkish invasion in 1974 and the resulting movement of refugees along both sides of the Green Line, and the establishment of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983, form the core issues which surround the ongoing Cyprus dispute.\\r\\nTurkey and the Turkish Cypriots backed the 2004 Annan Plan for Cyprus aimed at the reunification of the island, but the plan was subsequently rejected by Greek Cypriots on the grounds that it did not meet their needs. According to Greek Cypriots, the latest proposal included maintained residence rights for the many Anatolian Turks who moved to Cyprus after the invasion (and their descendants who were born on the island after 1974), while the Greek Cypriots who lost their property after the Turkish invasion would be granted only a restricted right of return to the north following the island's proposed reunification.[citation needed] Although the outcome received much criticism in the EU as well, the Republic of Cyprus was admitted into the EU a week after the referendum.\\r\\nThe Turkish government has refused to officially recognise the Republic of Cyprus until the removal of the political and economic blockade on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.[citation needed] Turkey's non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus has led to complications within the Customs Union. Under the customs agreements which Turkey had already signed as a precondition to start EU membership negotiations in 2005, it is obliged to open its ports to Cypriot planes and vessels, but Turkey has not complied so far;[114] refusing to do so until the EU eases the international isolation of Northern Cyprus.[115] In February 2013, Turkish EU Minister Egemen Ba??? told the Republic of Cyprus, \\"if you truly want salvation, truly want peace, then remove your blockade of Ercan Airport to EU member countries and Turkey will open its ports to you.\\"[116]\\r\\nTurkeys refusal to implement a trade pact between Turkey and the EU that requires the Turkish government to allow Greek Cypriot vessels to use its air and sea ports has prompted the EU to freeze eight chapters in Turkey's accession talks.[114]\\r\\nIn November 2009, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Cemil ?i?ek declared that, should Turkey be forced to choose between supporting either EU membership or Turkish Cypriots, \\"[then] Turkeys choice will forever be to stand next to the Turkish Cypriots. Everybody should understand this.\\"[114]\\r\\nThe issue of Turkish membership has been contentious in Greece. Opinion poll of 2005, suggest that only 25% of Greeks believe Turkey has a place in the European Union.[117] The former Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated that Turkish membership of the EU could only be predicated upon, \\"full compliance, full accession\\" in December 2006.[118] In 2005 the European Commission referred to relations between Turkey and Greece as \\"continuing to develop positively\\"[119] while also citing a key barrier to progress being Turkey's ongoing claim of casus belli over a dispute about territorial waters boundaries.[119] In September 2017, Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, mentioned that halting accession talks with Turkey would be a strategic mistake by the European Union, amid a war of words raging between Germany and Turkey.[120] Also, former Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou, has urged European Union leaders to keep the doors open to Turkey and to continue dialogue with the Turkish government, in an apparent reference to German Chancellor Angela Merkels calls for the suspension of accession talks with Turkey.[121]\\r\\nTurkey has a secular constitution, with no \\"official\\" state religion, although the chief imam (currently Mehmet G?rmez) is a civil servant and head of the Religious Affairs Directorate, or Diyanet.[122] 99% of the Turkish population is Muslim[123][124] of whom over 70% belong to the Sunni branch of Islam. A minority is affiliated with the Shi'a Alevi branch.[125] The Christians (Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Gregorian, Syriac, Protestant) and Jews (Sephardic, Ashkenazi) were formerly sizable religious minorities in the country, until the genocide of Greeks, Armenians and Assyrians.[citation needed] Turkey would be the first Muslim-majority country to join the European Union.[126][127]\\r\\nOfficial population census polls in Turkey do not include information regarding a person's religious belief or ethnic background due to the regulations set by the Turkish constitution, which defines all citizens of the Republic of Turkey as Turkish in terms of nationality, regardless of faith or race.[128]\\r\\nThere is a tradition of secularism in Turkey. The state has no official religion nor promotes any, and actively monitors the area between the religions.[129] The constitution recognises the freedom of religion for individuals, whereas religious communities are placed under the protection of the state; but the constitution explicitly states that they cannot become involved in the political process (by forming a religious party, for instance) or establish faith-based schools. No party can claim that it represents a form of religious belief; nevertheless, religious sensibilities are generally represented through conservative parties.[129] Turkey prohibits by law the wearing of religious headcover and theo-political symbolic garments for both sexes in government buildings, schools, and universities;[130] the law was upheld by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights as legitimate in the Leyla ?ahin v. Turkey case on 10 November 2005.[131] However, in 2010, the prohibition of wearing headscarfs in universities was lifted.\\r\\nCultural differences between Muslim majority Turkey and predominantly Christian majority Europe play an important part in the entire debate on Turkish accession to the European Union. In an analysis, based on the World Values Survey, the social scientists Arno Tausch and Almas Heshmati came to the conclusion that a robust measurement scale of global economic, political and social values and Turkey's place on them wields only a very qualified picture of Turkey's place on the maps of global values. The study, which is based on 92,289 representative individuals with complete data in 68 countries, representing 56.89% of the global population, looks at hard-core economic values in the countries concerned. From nine dimensions for the determination of the geography of human values, based on a promax factor analysis of the available data, six factor analytical scores to calculate a new Global Value Development Index were used, which combines: avoiding economic permissiveness; avoiding racism; avoiding distrust of the army and the press; avoiding the authoritarian character; tolerance and respect; and avoiding the rejection of the market economy and democracy. Turkey is ranked 25, ahead of several EU member countries. But there are still considerable deficits concerning the liberal values components, which are very important for an effective democracy. The deficits, the study argues, suggest that the Turkish state, Turkish civil society and European decision makers would be well advised to continue to support civil society and secular democracy in Turkey.[132]\\r\\nIn 2004, the French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier stated that Turkey must recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as a genocide.[133] However, he insisted that although France did not set a precondition for European Union entry regarding the matter, he stated that France would raise the issue during negotiations. The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, stated that it must be a precondition for Turkey to recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as genocide.[134]\\r\\nThe government of Turkey rejects such a precondition for EU membership and does not accept it as a part of the EU membership criteria.\\r\\nIn 2006, the European Parliament voted against a proposal to formally add the issue as a membership criterion for Turkey.[135] A similar proposal by Greek and Greek Cypriot MEPs was also rejected by the European Parliament in 2011.[136]\\r\\nIn 2013, during the case of Perin?ek v. Switzerland, the European Court of Human Rights judged that \\"The existence of a genocide, which was a precisely defined legal concept, was not easy to prove. The Court doubted that there could be a general consensus as to events such as those at issue, given that historical research was by definition open to discussion and a matter of debate, without necessarily giving rise to final conclusions or to the assertion of objective and absolute truths.\\"[137]\\r\\nIn contravention of European Union directives on human rights, Turkey banned LGBT pride parades in 2015 and 2016.[138][139][140] Reasons given for the ban were security concerns, and religious sensitivities caused by holding the parade during the month of Ramadan.\\r\\nArticle 301 states that \\"a person who publicly insults the Turkish nation, the State of the Republic of Turkey, or the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, shall be punishable by imprisonment of between six months and two years\\" and also that \\"expressions of thought intended to criticise shall not constitute a crime.\\"\\r\\nThe EU was especially critical of this law during the September 2005 trial of novelist Orhan Pamuk over comments that recognised the deaths of thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians. Enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn and members of the European Parliament called the case \\"regrettable\\", \\"most unfortunate\\", and \\"unacceptable\\".[141] After the case was dropped three months later, Turkey's Foreign Minister Abdullah Gl indicated that Turkey may abandon or modify Article 301, stating that \\"there may be need for a new law\\".[142] In September 2006, the European Parliament called for the abolition of laws, such as Article 301, \\"which threaten European free speech norms\\".[143] On 30 April 2008, the law was reformed.[144] According to the reform, it is now a crime to explicitly insult the \\"Turkish nation\\" rather than \\"Turkishness\\"; opening court cases based on Article 301 require the approval of the Justice Minister; and the maximum punishment has been reduced to two years in jail.[144]\\r\\nKemal Kerin?siz, an ultra-nationalist lawyer, and other members of Byk Hukuk?ular Birli?i (Great Jurists Union) headed by Kerin?siz, have been \\"behind nearly all of [Article 301] trials.\\"[145] In January 2008, Kerin?siz was arrested for participating in an ultra-nationalist underground organisation, Ergenekon, allegedly behind the attacks on the Turkish Council of State and Cumhuriyet newspaper,[146] the assassination of several Christian missionaries and Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink,[147] as well as allegedly plotting the assassination of Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk.[148][149]\\r\\nTurkey gave women the right to vote in 1930 for municipal elections. In 1934 this right was expanded for the national elections, while women were also given the right to become elected as MPs in the Turkish Parliament, or for being appointed as Ministers, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Parliament and President of the Republic. In 1993 Tansu ?iller became the first female Prime Minister of Turkey.\\r\\nIn its second report on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey, the European Parliament emphasised that respecting human rights, including womens rights, is an essential condition for Turkey's membership of the EU. According to the report, Turkey's legal framework on women's rights \\"has in general been satisfactory, but its substantive implementation remains flawed.\\"[150]\\r\\nTurkey is one of two states (along with Azerbaijan) among the 47 members of the Council of Europe which refused to recognise the status of conscientious objectors or give them an alternative to military service.[151]\\r\\nPublic opinion in EU countries generally opposes Turkish membership, though with varying degrees of intensity. The Eurobarometer SeptemberÿOctober 2006 survey[152] shows that 59% of EU-27 citizens are against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% are in favour. Nearly all citizens (about 9 in 10) expressed concerns about human rights as the leading cause. In the earlier MarchÿMay 2006 Eurobarometer, citizens from the new member states were more in favour of Turkey joining (44% in favour) than the old EU-15 (38% in favour). At the time of the survey, the country whose population most strongly opposed Turkish membership was Austria (con: 81%), while Romania was most in favour of the accession (pro: 66%). On a wider political scope, the highest support comes from the Turkish Cypriot Community (pro: 67%) (which is not recognised as sovereign state and is de facto not EU territory and out of the European institutions). These communities are even more in favour of the accession than the Turkish populace itself (pro: 54%).[153] Opposition in Denmark to Turkish membership was polled at 60% in October 2007, despite the Danish government's support for Turkey's EU bid.[154]\\r\\nThe opening of membership talks with the EU in December 2004 was celebrated by Turkey with much fanfare,[155] but the Turkish populace has become increasingly sceptical as negotiations are delayed based on what it views as lukewarm support for its accession to the EU and alleged double standards in its negotiations particularly with regard to the French and Austrian referendums. A mid-2006 Eurobarometer survey revealed that 43% of Turkish citizens view the EU positively; just 35% trust the EU, 45% support enlargement and just 29% support an EU constitution.[156]\\r\\nMoreover, Turks are divided on whether to join at all. A 2007 poll put Turkish support for accession to the EU at 41.9% (up from 32% in 2006), with 27.7% opposed and 24.0% indifferent.[157] A 2009 poll showed that support for accession had risen to 48%, even as negative views of the EU had risen from 28% to 32%.[158] A 2013 poll showed Turkish support for the EU bid at one third of the population, and opposition to double that share.[159]\\r\\nAccording to the Transatlantic Trends survey for 2013, 60% of Turks have an unfavourable view of the European Union[160] and most Turks believe that working with Asia is more important to their national interests than working with Europe.[161] 44% of Turks believe EU membership could be good for the economy in contrast with 61% for EU citizens.[162] During an interview with Euractiv, EU Minister Egemen Ba??? stated that: \\"This is what Europe needs to do; they need to say that when Turkey fulfills all requirements, Turkey will become a member of the EU on date X. Then, we will regain the Turkish public opinion support in one day.\\"[163]\\r\\n\\"... under my Presidency of the Commission ... no further enlargement will take place over the next five years. As regards Turkey, the country is clearly far away from EU membership. A government that blocks Twitter is certainly not ready for accession.\\"","input":"When did turkey became part of european union?"},{"output":"season two","context":"Damon Salvatore is a fictional character in The Vampire Diaries novel series. He is portrayed by Ian Somerhalder in the television series. Initially, Damon is the main antagonist in the beginning of the show and later became a protagonist. After the first few episodes, Damon begins working alongside his younger brother, Stefan Salvatore, to resist greater threats and gradually Elena begins to consider him a friend. In 1864, Damon became a vampire after being shot by his father with Katherine's blood in his system. His transition was completed after his younger brother Stefan, who is also a vampire, convinces him to drink blood. Damon, angry that Katherine chose to turn Stefan as well, vows to make his brother's life sorrowful ÿ thus further causing a century-long rift between the two brothers. Elena Gilbert chooses to be with Damon in the finale episode.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIan Somerhalder was cast as Damon Salvatore at the end of March 2009, six months before the premiere of the series.[1] The initial casting call for the character required an actor in his early- to mid-twenties to play a \\"darkly handsome, strong, charming, and smug vampire who can go from casual and playful to pure evil in less than a heartbeat.\\"[2] Somerhalder had not read the books until filming began.[3]\\r\\nDamon Salvatore is a vampire, turned by Katherine Pierce 145 years prior to the series' debut. He is the son of late Giuseppe Salvatore, ripper Lily Salvatore and older brother of Stefan Salvatore. He is portrayed as a charming, handsome and snarky person who loves tricking humans, and takes pleasure in feeding on them and killing them during the early episodes of the first season, unlike his brother, Stefan.\\r\\nIn the first season, Damon appears as the frightening older brother to Stefan Salvatore, and plays as the main antagonist for the first initial episodes with a hidden agenda.[4] Slowly, Damon begins to be kinder to the other characters, showing brief moments of compassion such as erasing Jeremy's memory of vampires and removing his \\"suffering\\"[4] so Jeremy gets his life back on track.[5] Damon apologizes for turning Vicki Donovan into a vampire and admits it was wrong.[6] Later at the Gilbert house, Elena returns home. Damon admits that he came to the town wanting to destroy it but actually found himself wanting to protect it after everything that happened at the Founder's Day celebrations and says he's not a hero and doesn't do good, saying it's not in him - those traits are reserved for Stefan, Elena and Bonnie. The two begin to kiss passionately before getting interrupted - it is later revealed that it wasn't Elena he kissed, but Katherine Pierce.[6] Later in the season, it also implies that he actually feels human emotions, such as pain and love, which helps the viewer sympathize toward his character in some situations. But mostly, he likes to take care of himself and do the dirty work, in his own sadistic ways.\\r\\nIn season two, Katherine tells Damon that she never loved him and that it was always Stefan. Elena says something similar later, leaving Damon heartbroken. As an expression of his anger, pain, and hopelessness, he snaps Jeremy Gilbert's neck, not realizing he is wearing a ring which reverses damage done by supernatural creatures or forces. Jeremy survives because of the ring, but Damon's action incurs Elena's wrath and pain. When Bonnie also discovers it was his blood that enabled Caroline Forbes to become a vampire, the two declare their hatred for him, leaving angrier than ever.[7] After saving Elena with Stefan in episode 8 of season 2, Damon shows up in Elena's room with the vervain necklace that was ripped from her neck earlier in the episode. Before he gives it back, he tells Elena that he is in love with her, and because he is in love with her, he cannot be selfish with her. He also states that he doesn't deserve her, but that his brother does. He kisses her forehead and says he wishes she could remember this, but she can't. As the camera shows a close up of Damon's eye as he is compelling Elena to forget, a tear slips. Elena blinks and her vervain necklace is back around her neck, Damon is gone and her window is open with the curtains blowing. She had no recollection as to how the necklace was returned to her. In one episode, Damon joins Rose to find out why the originals are after Elena; after some time and clever banter, the two have sex, stating that they could rid themselves of emotion. However, when Rose, Damon's old friend who turned Katerina, suffers from a werewolf bite, he gives her the memory of her life prior to becoming a vampire, and helps her remember how good it felt to be able to wall and feel the sunlight, without it burning her. During this meaningful moment, Damon mercifully kills her, leaving him to mourn the death of his one of very few friends. Elena and Damon then begin to mend fences, and Elena gives him an affectionate hug to help comfort him after Rose's death. Damon begins showing another side of himself in small acts that help build what once was an impossible friendship between Elena and himself, after she clearly stated that he has lost her forever. After he spares Caroline's mother, Elena says how that was the person she was once friends with. And it's hard for Damon to accept that he has to change to have her in his life, which he explains to Andy Star, his compelled girlfriend a few more episodes in. Damon is bitten by Tyler the werewolf at the end of the season. Elena takes care of him, and right before he is cured by the blood of Klaus, the original hybrid, she gives him a \\"goodbye\\" kiss, because she was sure he was going to die. She even forgives him, telling him that she cares for him through grief-stricken tears.\\r\\nIn the third season, Damon helps Elena in bringing his brother, Stefan, back to Mystic Falls after Stefan becomes Klaus' henchman. The arrangement transpired after a bargain for his blood that would cure Damon of the werewolf bite he had received from Tyler. At first, he is reluctant to involve Elena in the rescue attempts, employing Alaric Saltzman, Elena's guardian, instead as Klaus does not know that Elena is alive after the sacrifice which frees Klaus' hybrid side. However, Elena involves herself, desperate to find Stefan. Damon, though hesitant at first, is unable to refuse her because of his love for her. He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger, clearly showing that she also has feelings for him. He tells her that \\"when (he) drag(s) (his) brother from the edge to deliver him back to (her), (he) wants her to remember the things (she) felt while he was gone.\\" When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls, his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons. This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate. A still loyal Elena, however, refuses to admit her feelings for Damon. In 'Dangerous Liaisons', Elena, frustrated with her feelings for him, tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem, and that this could be causing all their troubles. This incenses Damon, causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons. The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion, Elena ÿ for the first time in the three seasons ÿ kisses Damon of her own accord. This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realize that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress, Katherine Pierce, who turned the brothers, once did. In assessment of her feelings for Damon, she states this: \\"Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do, I can't shake him.\\" In the season finale, a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice: to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time. She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision. Damon, who is trying to stop Alaric, accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan, her choice may have been different. This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was, in fact, the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan. Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love, Damon compels her to forget. He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric, whose life line is tied to Elena's, suddenly collapses in his arms. Damon is grief-stricken, knowing that this means that Elena has also died and yells, \\"No! You are not dead!\\" A heartbroken Damon then goes to the hospital demanding to see Elena when the doctor, Meredith Fell, tells him that she gave Elena vampire blood. The last shot of the season finale episode shows Elena in transition.\\r\\nDamon starts season 4 at Elena's bedside after finding out about her dying with vampire blood in her system, causing her to start the transition to Vampire. Damon decides to firstly try to kill Rebekah with a White Oak Stake, yet she overpowers him. Rebekah is shot at through the Window and Damon escapes.\\r\\nLater in part of a plan with the Sheriff and Meredith Fell, Damon uses Matt as bait to draw out the deputies and Pastor Young. After dispatching the deputies, Damon decides to take out some aggression on Matt and is about to snap his neck when stopped by the new vampire Elena. After Elena and Stefan go hunting on animals the next morning and Elena has her first feed on a deer she pukes the blood out. Meanwhile, it seems a new vampire hunter is in town. Elena goes to Damon for help, he pulls her with him to the bathroom and makes her drink his blood because he says \\"You need warm blood from the vein, so maybe this'll do the trick.\\" He says it's personal and Elena wonders why but no answer was given. She drinks his blood but pukes hours later. When Stefan finds out Damon has feed Elena his blood he's very angry and hits Damon who just got in a fight with the vampire hunter.\\r\\nDamon has decided to leave town, but through the early episodes of Season 4 seems to be looking for reasons to stay. Meredith Fell seems to be one who convinces him in 'The Rager' to stay to help Elena with her transition to Vampire. Indeed, a renewed conflict over ideology and what sort of Vampire Elena will become drives Damon and Stefan apart.\\r\\nThe Five, shows Damon tasking Stefan with learning more about the Vampire Hunter, Connor while Damon decides to accompany both Bonnie and Elena to College. This trip is ostensibly about teaching Elena the 'hunt': how to catch, feed and erase. After some initial problems, Elena has a Frat Party gets success and seems to enjoy herself causing friction with Bonnie. She leaves the party and later states that she doesn't want to be like Damon. In the next episode, she begins to believe that Stefan is lying to her and takes things into her own hands to kill the vampire hunter who is holding her brother, Matt, and April captive. She does, and begins to suffer from hallucinations at the end of the episode. After asking Stefan why he wants to cure Elena, Damon tells him that he loves Elena as a vampire or human.\\r\\nIn the episode 'We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes', Damon helps Elena in dealing with her hallucinations and saves her from committing suicide. He also helps uncover the mystery about the hunter's curse with the help of Bonnie and Professor Shane. At the end of the episode, he reveals the truth about the cure to Elena and explains how Stefan has been lying to her only to find this possible cure for vampirism. However, Elena breaks up with Stefan at the end of the episode after confessing her gradually growing feelings for Damon.\\r\\nIn the following episode \\"My Brother's Keeper\\", Elena tells Damon he is the reason she and Stefan broke up and at the end of the episode Damon and Elena finally have sex. After that it turns out Elena is sired with Damon, first they think it is the reason why Elena loves Damon, but in episode \\"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street\\" they found out that it only affects how you act, not how you feel. The sire-bond can only be broken when Damon leaves Elena and tells her to stop caring about him according to a witch in New Orleans named Nandi. In the following episode Damon goes with Elena to her family's lake house to help with Jeremy's Hunter instincts. In the episode Elena tries to act like a couple with Damon, but he refuses to even kiss her out of his guilt about the sire bond and worry that he's taking advantage of her. In the end of the episode Damon invokes the sire bond telling Elena to return to Mystic Falls while he trains Jeremy \\"O Come, All Ye Faithful\\". Elena kisses him goodbye.\\r\\nIn 'After School Special', Damon is at the Lake House training Jeremy, along with Matt Donovan. Klaus shows up and threatens Damon, wanting him to get Jeremy's mark completed earlier rather than later. Damon is shown to be reluctant, not wanting to hurt innocents for Elena's sake, but Klaus follows through with his plans regardless. Later in the episode Elena calls Damon and confesses she's in love with him and it's the 'most real thing she's ever felt in her entire life', in a moment of weakness Damon tells her to come see him. Afterward Damon is confronted with a bar of newly turned vampires for Jeremy to kill concedes that it's the quickest way, however balks when Klaus takes control and compels the newly turned vamps to kill Matt Donovan. In Catch Me If You Can Damon tells the boys to run since Jeremy isn't ready to take on all these vampires. Later when Elena arrives her and Damon argue over the killing of innocents and tells her to take Matt home while he and Jeremy take care of Klaus's newly turned vampires. However Kol shows up and has killed all the vampires, determined to stop them from finding the cure & waking Silas, and threatens Jeremy's life. Kol compels Damon to stake himself and later to kill Jeremy and to forget what Kol compelled him to do. Upon arriving back in Mystic Falls Damon begins to seek out Jeremy due to the compulsion, however when he sees him in the grill he realizes what Kol compelled him to do and tells Jeremy to run. Damon chases Jeremy throughout Mystic Falls and advises Jeremy that he is compelled and he needs to kill him. Jeremy shoots Damon in the head and when Damon awakens later starts cursing the youngest Gilbert, calling him stupid for not killing him. At the end of the episode Damon catches up with Jeremy Elena follows and urges Damon to fight it because \\"You love me and I love you\\", but he tells her that he can't, falls to his knees and urges Jeremy to kill him. Stefan shows up just in time to break Damon's neck and lock him up until they can take care of Kol. Damon spends the next episode locked up and bled dry by a jealous and snarky Stefan and engages in a conversation with Klaus about Caroline, Rebekah and Elena.\\r\\nWhen the group goes to the mysterious island to find the Cure, Damon continues to be suspicious of Professor Shane. When Jeremy goes missing and Bonnie and Shane stay behind to try a locator spell, Damon stays to keep an eye on Shane. He later begins torturing Shane for information, but Shane starts analyzing Damon and telling him Elena will go back to Stefan once she's cured. Elena interrupts the torture session and Damon storms out and Elena follows. She tells Damon that she's sure her feelings for him are real and asks him to become human with her, however Damon tells her he has no desire to be human and that human/vampire relationships are doomed and stalks off. Afterward he is captured by Vaughn, another member of the Five, who tortures Damon and leads him around with a noose around his neck. Damon goes with Vaughn to the cavern close to where Silas is buried and eventually overpowers him, but not before Vaughn injures Rebekah. Elena and Stefan come across the injured Damon and Rebekah, Stefan stays while Elena rushes to find Jeremy. Damon urges Stefan to go get the cure for Elena, uncaring that there is only enough for one, because he wants it for the girl he loves. After Stefan leave Rebekah comments that Damon did something selfless and remarks that he will always love Elena. An exhausted Damon admits that he can't control everything and is tired.\\r\\nAfter Katherine kills Jeremy in 'Down the Rabbit Hole' Damon stays behind determined to find the missing Bonnie, telling Stefan he can't come home without her. Eventually he finds Bonnie, hugging her in relief, but when the two arrive back in Mystic Falls in informs Stefan Bonnie has lost her mind. Elena, who had been in denial about Jeremy's death, comes into reality and demands Damon bring Jeremy's body downstairs. When Elena starts breaking down Stefan urges Damon to help her, indicating he should invoke the sire bond to take away her pain, however instead Damon tells Elena to shut off her emotions. In the next episode Damon begins trying to track Katherine in order to find the cure while Rebekah attempts to tag along. He finds an old friend from his past, Will, dying from a werewolf bite and kills him out of mercy. He arrives back home just in time to stop Elena from killing Caroline and takes her with to New York. While in NY Damon begins investigating Katherine's whereabouts and tries to keep that he's looking for the cure from Elena. Elena finds out and attempts to play him all the while Damon tells her and Rebekah about his time here in the 1970s. He admits that he had his emotions off and Lexi had come to help him on Stefan's behalf, however he tricks her into believing he fell in love with her only to leave her trapped on the roof during the day as revenge. He reveals that the reason he killed Lexi in season one was out of the guilt she stirred in him. Elena kisses Damon and attempts to steal Katherine's address out of his pocket, however Damon was aware she was trying to play him the entire time, and attempts to convince her to turn her emotions back on. Rebekah shows up and snaps his neck. He then calls Stefan and the brothers attempt to track down Elena. The decide to give up on the cure after Elena kills a waitress and threatens to kill people.\\r\\nIn 'Pictures of You' Damon, along with Stefan, decide they're going to try making Elena turn her emotions back on. The Salvatore brothers decide to take Elena to the prom, where Damon asks Elena why she told him she was in love with him and it's the most real thing she ever felt. Elena tells Damon that she only said it because of the sire bond and she feels nothing for him. However, later when Bonnie nearly kills Elena, she cries out for Damon to help her and he locks her up in the Salvatore basement. Damon then manipulates Elena's dreams in an attempt to remind how much she loves her friends in family, however when it doesn't work the Salvatore brothers (per Stefan's advice) try torturing Elena to get her to feel emotion. Elena however calls their bluff and attempts to kill herself, knowing Damon would never really hurt her and let her die. Damon realizes that Elena is smart and that torture will not work. After Katherine frees Elena Damon comes up with a plan, killing Matt in front of her (while he wore the Gilbert ring) and it works to get Elena's emotions back on. When Elena focuses her hate on Katherine Damon tells Elena where Katherine is, but tells her she shouldn't try and kill her. Damon admits he hates Katherine, however he knows once Elena kills her all her other emotions (grief & guilt) will all come flooding back in. Elena stakes Damon in the stomach when he attempts to stop her.\\r\\nIn the season finale 'Graduation', he tries to give the cure to Elena, but Elena refuses, which tells him that there is no more sire bond. He gets shot by Vaughn with a bullet laced with werewolf venom, and almost dies, but Klaus comes back to Mystic Falls and saves him. At the end of the episode, Elena proclaims her love for him stating that of all the decisions she has made choosing him will prove to be the worse one.\\r\\nNot aware of Stefan's absence and Bonnie's death, Damon and Elena are having the time of their lives before Elena leaves for Whitmore college. College brings a lot of ups and downs to the on screen romance. Katherine begs Damon to protect her as she feels someone is after her, Damon by the help of Jeremy's vampire hunter instincts that Silas is possessing as Stefan. Silas gives Damon a crash course on why he looks like Stefan and tells where was he the whole summer, shocked to know about this he starts to search Stefan with the help of Stefan. Silas mind-controlled Elena to kill Damon but Elena resists it by thinking about her worries for Stefan. Both Elena and Damon, with the help of Sheriff Forbes, finds the safe where Stefan was drowning the whole summer, but only to find a dead body. Due to both Elena and Katherine having same nightmare of Stefan all three, Damon, Elena and Katherine search for Stefan. Damon finally finds Stefan inside a hut where he is tied up in the chair and Qetsiyah makes a link of Stefan with Silas which fries Stefan's brain. Qetsiyah reveals to Damon that his relationship with Elena is doomed. Damon and Elena take Stefan where both of them finds out that he has memory loss and can't remember anything. Damon, to make Stefan remember about his past life, gives him his journals and spends quality time with him. Jeremy tells Damon that Bonnie is dead and Damon finally tells Elena about Bonnie. At Bonnie's funeral, Damon consoles Elena. Damon wants to help Silas so that Silas can do a spell to swap his life with Bonnie as Silas wants to die. Silas had seen Qetsiyah going to the party therefore both Damon and Silas goes to the ball party at Whitmore College. Silas needs Damon to kill Stefan, so that he can get back his power. Stefan, after waking up, tricked Damon and snapped his neck. At Salvatore's mansion they bring a desiccated Silas, to trade Silas's life with Bonnie he must become mortal(witch). The only way is by the cure so Elena and Damon calls Katherine who has the cure in her blood and after she arrives her blood is drained by Silas, but still Katherine lived. Amara is then awakened and revealed to be the mystic anchor. She then cures herself of her immortality by feeding off Silas.\\r\\nAt the beginning of season 6, Damon is still trapped in the 1994 snapshot with Bonnie, forced to relive the same day over and over again. As the season progresses, the duo meet Kai Parker who's provides them with clues on how to get back home. In a truly selfless act, Bonnie manages to send Damon back while she remains in 1994 with Kai. Back home, things aren't as Damon expected them to be. Elena has compelled her memories of their time together and moved on. After a few initial set backs, Damon sets his mind to wooing her back.\\r\\nAs the season progresses, Elena falls for Damon all over again as they search for a way to free Bonnie and she becomes a large part of his support as his good friend Liz Forbes becomes more and more ill with cancer. Kai, who escaped the Prison World without Bonnie and merged with Luke, has absorbed some of Luke's qualities and is now moved by guilt to help free Bonnie. With his help, he, along with Damon, Elena, and Jeremy, are able to visit the Prison World and remind Bonnie that there is still magic residing in Qetsiyah's headstone in Nova Scotia.\\r\\nAfter the death of Liz, Caroline is unable to bear the pain of losing her mother and chooses to turn off her humanity just as Bonnie returns. Bonnie brought back with her a strange video she'd caught while leaving a second Prison World she'd been moved to set in October 31, 1903. She shows the video to Damon and he recognizes his own mother, Lillian Salvatore, standing in the background. Troubled with the news that his mother is still alive after believing she'd been dead since 1858, Damon's informed by Kai that his mother was placed in a Prison World due to being a Ripper and the heinous number of deaths she'd caused. Unfortunately, Stefan is forced by Caroline to turn off his humanity and Kai, Bonnie, Damon, and Elena have to travel to Lily's 1903 Prison World to retrieve her and use her as a means to get Stefan back.\\r\\nDamon is disturbed to learn when he gets to Lily that she has been trapped with other vampires and they allowed her to drink their portions of blood to stay alive. She is reluctant to leave without them, but Damon threatens to leave her behind if she doesn't go. Bonnie, Damon, and Elena leave with Lily, leaving Kai behind. When they return, Bonnie gives Damon a gift she'd gotten for him during her trip to Nova Scotia in the 1994 Prison World: the cure to vampirism. He struggles with whether or not to give it to Elena and provide her with the life she'd been robbed of.\\r\\nAfter using Lily to get Stefan's humanity back and he is used to bring Caroline back, Lily is adamant about returning to her Prison World to retrieve what she considers to be her family. Damon confronts Bonnie, who had taken the Ascendant, and tells her that Lily is threatening to destroy the cure if he doesn't return with the means to get her \\"family\\" back. However, when he decides to let Bonnie destroy the Ascendant, he comes home to find that Lily had actually given the cure to Elena instead. He confesses that he was selfish and afraid of losing her but agrees that she should take it and that he'll take it with her.\\r\\nElena takes the cure and, unexpectedly, her memories return and she remembers when she'd traveled to Nova Scotia with Damon in search of the cure the first time, he'd told her that he used to miss being human, but, now, he couldn't imagine anything more miserable. She tells him he needs to think about it before making that decision and enlists Stefan to try to make sure Damon is certain of his choice to become human. Damon almost decides he'd rather stay a vampire until he witnesses an interaction between an older couple. Before Jo and Ric's wedding, he tells Elena he'd made his choice to live one lifetime with her. During the wedding, Kai shows up and stabs Jo before causing an explosion. The second to last episode ends with Elena lying unconscious on the ground.\\r\\nIn the last episode of the 6th season titled \\"I'm Thinking Of You All The While\\" Damon rushes Elena to the hospital after vampire blood fails to heal and awaken her. At the hospital the doctors tell him that she is medically healthy and they see no reason why she's not awake. Kai stumbles into the hospital injured. After consuming Lily's blood and killing himself, Kai's ability to siphon magic allowed him to become another Heretic (vampire with witch-like power), but he was soon bitten by a transforming Tyler, who had re-triggered his werewolf curse. Kai tells Damon and he's linked Elena's life to Bonnie's and as long as Bonnie lives, Elena will remain asleep but perfectly healthy. He also tells him that the spell is permanent and any attempt to find a loophole in the spell will result in the death of both Bonnie and Elena. Damon returns to the wedding to find Bonnie badly injured on the floor and Kai's reminder that letting Bonnie die will allow Elena to regain consciousness. Damon tells Bonnie he's sorry and leaves the room. Kai is irritated that his plan to torture Damon with an impossible choice had failed and, while he's distracted, Damon decapitates him from behind. Damon saves Bonnie's life and they go to the Salvatore boarding house to say their goodbyes to Elena, deciding that they will allow Bonnie to live her life and, when she dies, Elena will wake. Damon allows himself to enter Elena's subconscious to say his goodbye, dancing with her and telling her that he'll never be ready to live the next 60 years of his life without her. Stefan and Damon move the coffin holding Elena to a crypt and have Bonnie seal the door magically to keep away those seeking the Cure.\\r\\nThe season ends with the impression that quite a bit of time has passed. Mystic Falls is desolate and run down after the return of the other Heretics, Lily's \\"family\\". The last scene shows Damon looking torn standing on the clock tower he once sat on with Elena.\\r\\nAt the start of season 1, Damon was a self-proclaimed loner,[8] often keeps to himself. Despite his initially antagonistic relationships with humans such as Alaric Saltzman and Sheriff Elizabeth Forbes, Caroline's mother. Damon gradually involved himself into the lives of many people in Mystic Falls by developing friendships with several humans. After spending time with Elena Gilbert, Damon becomes more empathetic and falls deeply, madly and passionately in love with her. He always puts her safety first before anyone else, even his.[9][10]\\r\\nDamon's most prominent love, aside from Elena, was Rose. He met her while searching for Klaus and hooked up with her shortly after. Unfortunately Damon ticked off Jules, a werewolf, and she showed up on a full moon for revenge.\\r\\nDamon has had a challenging relationship with his younger brother Stefan Salvatore for over a century. Before they became vampires, they both loved the vampire Katherine Pierce. Damon shows that he has nurtured a long-standing desire to reunite with Katherine throughout the first season. In the first season, we learn that it was Stefan who convinced Damon to feed and complete his transformation after Katherine turned both brothers into vampires.[11] Despite the feud between the Salvatore brothers, both Damon and Stefan always have each other's backs. Damon is always there for Stefan when it really matters, e.g., saving him from being tortured, helping him through withdrawal, and working with him to kill common enemies.[12] And Stefan will still give up his own life for Damon's survival. They both actually love each other but won't admit it, however:[13]\\r\\nAfter learning of Katherine's deceit, Damon starts to fall for, Elena. In general, Damon is fiercely protective of Elena and always puts her safety ahead of all else. Damon comes to Elena's rescue at the Miss Mystic Falls pageant when Elena is left stranded without a partner, and the two dance. In the episode \\"Rose\\", Damon confesses his love for her only to compel her to forget about it because he doesn't believe he is worthy of her. Throughout the third season his relationship with Elena grows; she learns to fully trust him, and they begin to rely on each other as a team. They share two passionate kisses, but Elena remains in denial about her feelings for him. After a long struggle, Elena still chooses Stefan much to Damon's dismay. In the following season, however, Elena realizes that her feelings for Damon cannot be denied any longer. She and Stefan break up, and in the following episode Damon and Elena finally get together and have sex. Damon and Elena then both individually discover that Elena is sired to Damon, making Elena's feelings unfortunately known; however, Elena insists that her love for Damon is the most real thing that she's ever felt in her entire life. Damon remains doubtful, so in \\"O Come, All Ye Faithful\\" he sets her \\"free\\". In an interview before the season finale, Julie Plec stated that \\"This year, she's had a very traumatic roller coaster of life experience and it's changed her irrevocablyand at the center of it all was the diehard belief that she loved Damon, that she loved him more than she'd ever loved anyone.\\" [14] In \\"Graduation\\", after the sire bond is broken and there remains no doubt about Elena's feelings, she reveals that she is in love with Damon.\\r\\nDamon and Elena spend the next few months together, having the summer of their lives. When Elena has to leave for college, Damon stays behind in Mystic Falls and they have a functional long distance relationship. However, in the episode \\"Original Sin\\", Tessa, who is revealed to be Qetsiyah, tells Damon that the doppelgangers are fated to fall in love and that he is only a bump in the road that makes their story interesting. Damon refuses to believe in this and assures Elena that he will fight for her and their future together as she is his life. It is later revealed that there is nothing fated about Stefan and Elena, but that they were merely drawn together by a spell. After a tumultuous, back and forth relationship, Damon and Elena get back together at the end of the season, and they choose to sacrifice themselves together to save Stefan and Alaric and their other friends on the Other Side. When Elena makes it back but Damon is trapped on the collapsing Other Side, Elena is devastated. Damon says his last goodbye to Elena, telling her that she is by far the best thing that has ever happened to him, and that being loved by her is \\"the epitome of a fulfilled life\\", as Elena sobs inconsolably. In season 6, Elena is unable to move on from Damon's death months later. She pretends to be happy, but she is secretly taking witch herbs to hallucinate Damon. When the herbs make her dangerous to humans, Elena decides to have Alaric compel away her memories of Damon, because she will never be able to move on otherwise. When Damon returns, he attempts to help her remember their love story, but the compulsion will not break. Not remembering any of the good things about Damon, Elena still decides to give him another chance. She slowly falls in love with him again, ultimately declaring that no matter whether she has memories of him or not, she always finds her way back to him. When Bonnie returns from the prison world, she gifts Damon with the cure for vampirism, knowing that he wanted to give it to Elena. However, Damon is afraid that this will mean losing Elena. They discuss what a human life together would be like. Elena initially rejects the cure, but Damon decides to take it with her so that they can have a human life together, including children. Damon always wanted Elena to have the human life she always dreamed of. Elena takes the cure, which breaks the compulsion, and her memories of Damon return to her. She recalls a memory from season 4, where Damon declares that there would be nothing more miserable than becoming human again. Elena is afraid that Damon would regret taking the cure, so she challenges him to think it through carefully. Stefan attempts to convince Damon that becoming human would be a bad decision, but Damon ultimately realizes that one lifetime with Elena is infinitely better than an immortal one without her, and confidently believes her to be his soulmate. Damon and Elena excitedly anticipate the beginning of their human future together, until Kai puts Elena under a sleeping spell, tied to Bonnie's life.\\r\\nDamon spends the next two seasons devoted to Elena, waiting for her to wake up. He repeatedly states that he is miserable without her, and will spend the next 60 or so years unhappily until Bonnie dies. However, Damon is committed to staying true to Elena, and doing right by her. Elena is shown to be Damon's moral compass, and his guiding force throughout the two seasons. When Damon is in the Phoenix Stone's version of hell, a vision of Stefan asks Damon \\"What would Elena do?\\" and this prompts Damon to forgive his mother, freeing him from hell. The phoenix stone's influence remains, and Damon accidentally lights Elena's coffin on fire (or so he thinks). Believing that he has unwittingly killed the love of his life, Damon becomes suicidal. When confronted with the hunter Rayna, Damon commands her to kill him because he is already in hell in a world without Elena. Enzo then reveals to Damon that Elena is still alive, renewing Damon's hope. When Damon realizes that he is a potential danger to his friends and family because he does not believe he is good without Elena, he decides to desiccate himself next to her. He write to Alaric that before Elena, he didn't know what it was like to be happy, fulfilled or complete, and that he doesn't want to continue living without that feeling. After Stefan wakes Damon from his desiccation, Damon continues to be devoted to his future with Elena. At the end of season 7, he is lured into a trap by a siren, hearing Elena's voice calling out to him. When the siren takes control of Damon's mind in season 8, Damon spends a significant amount of time sleeping, seeking refuge in dreams of his memories of Elena. When Sybil erases Elena from Damon's consciousness only to insert herself into their memories, Damon fights back, instinctively drawn back to Elena. His love for her prevails, and he breaks the siren's mind control, regaining his memories of Elena. Julie Plec stated that \\"I think the only hope that he's holding on to is the idea of the two of them living in Tribeca in their brownstone and raising kids and having a life together as humans when this is all said and done.\\" [15] After Stefan gives Damon the cure to vampirism, turning him into a human, and Bonnie unbreaks the spell on Elena, Damon and Elena finally reunite. They begin their life together, getting married while Elena goes to medical school and becomes a doctor. Eventually they return to Mystic Falls to grow old together, where they died together of old age. We last see them walking hand in hand in the afterlife before reuniting with their respective families.\\r\\nAlaric is a vampire hunter looking to avenge his wife by killing the vampire that killed her. It is soon revealed that the vampire that Alaric is hunting is actually Damon. Before killing Alaric, he confesses that he didn't kill Isobel but turned her. Alaric is brought back to life by the Gilbert ring. The two remain enemies but work together on occasion. Eventually, the two become best friends and drinking buddies. Even after Alaric is turned into a vampire who kills other vampires, Damon does his best to ensure that they don't have to kill him. But with Elena's death, Alaric dies as well while Damon holds him. In the episode, \\"Memorial\\", it's clear that Damon still misses his friend as he talks to Alaric at his grave. Unknown to him, Alaric listens to the whole thing and even responds with \\"I miss you too, buddy\\". Damon's best friend.\\r\\nBonnie first saw Damon in Friday Night Bites when he dropped Caroline off at cheerleading practice. They first interacted in Haunted, when Damon learned that Bonnie had come into possession of the Bennett Talisman. He needed this to open the tomb which Katherine was locked in (for 145 years or so he believed). At first, Bonnie didn't want to have anything to do with Damon, saving his life only for Elena's sake and soon blaming him for Caroline's transition into a vampire. However, as time went on, Bonnie was put into situations where she had to work with Damon to achieve what they both wanted (albeit reluctantly at first). Their teamwork has often proved to be beneficial for the both of them. Their relationship has even come to a point where Damon is visibly worried for Bonnie's well-being and was devastated when he found out about her death. The improvement of their relationship is seen in Damon's efforts to help bring Bonnie back from the dead. However, their unique friendship hit a speed bump when Damon reverted to his old ways. Finally, they stood side by side with each other as The Other Side collapsed, holding each other's hand and at peace with what is to come for the both of them. They later discover that they are trapped in a 1994 Prison World. During that time, they start to bond and form a close alliance to take down Kai. Before sending Damon back home, she mentions that he's not exactly the last person she would wanna be stuck with. When Damon returns home, he does everything he can to find a way to bring Bonnie back, including a long road trip to Oregon to seek the Gemini Coven, and also compelling Alaric to steal the Ascendant from Jo. They finally reunite at the Salvatore Boarding House with a hug after Sheriff Forbes's funeral. It's shown that Damon and Bonnie genuinely care about each other and have made sacrifices for each other.","input":"When does damon first develop feelings for elena?"},{"output":"B. R. Ambedkar","context":"The Dalit Buddhist movement (also known as Neo-Buddhist movement[1]) is a socio-political movement by Dalits in India started by B. R. Ambedkar. It radically re-interpreted Buddhism and created a new school of Buddhism called Navayana. The movement has sought to be a socially and politically engaged form of Buddhism.[2][3]\\r\\nThe movement was launched in 1956 by Ambedkar when nearly half a million Dalits ÿ formerly untouchables ÿ joined him and converted to his Navayana Buddhism.[4] It rejected Hinduism, challenged caste system and promoted the rights of the Dalit community.[5][4] The movement also rejected the teachings of traditional Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana sects of Buddhism, and took an oath to pursue a new form of engaged Buddhism as taught by Ambedkar.[6][7][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBuddhism originated in ancient India and grew after Ashoka adopted it. By the 2nd century CE, Buddhism was widespread in India and had expanded outside of India into Central Asia, East Asia and parts of Southeast Asia.[8][9] During the Middle Ages, Buddhism slowly declined in India,[10] while it vanished from Persia and Central Asia as Islam became the state religion.[11][12]\\r\\nAccording to Randall Collins, Buddhism was already declining in India by the 12th century, but with the pillage by Muslim invaders it nearly became extinct in India.[13] In the 13th century, states Craig Lockard, Buddhist monks in India escaped to Tibet to escape Islamic persecution;[14] while the monks in western India, states Peter Harvey, escaped persecution by moving to south Indian Hindu kingdoms that were able to resist the Muslim power.[15]\\r\\nEfforts to revive Buddhism in India began in the 19th-century, such as with the efforts of Sri Lankan Buddhist leader Anagarika Dharmapala who founded the Maha Bodhi Society.[16] The Maha Bodhi Society, according to Bhagwan Das, was not a Dalit movement however, because it mainly attracted upper-caste Hindus to Buddhism.[17]\\r\\nTwo early Dalit movements that rejected Hinduism were launched by Swami Achhutanand Harihar in Uttar Pradesh and Babu Mangu Ram in Punjab. These were called Adi Dharma movements.[18]\\r\\nAchhutanand was born in an untouchable family, joined the Arya Samaj suddhi reform movement, worked there for about eight years (1905-1912), felt untouchability was being practiced in Arya Samaj in subtle ways, left it and launched Bharitiya Achhut Mahasabha as a socio-political movement.[18] Achhutanand began spreading his ideas by publishing the Adi-Hindu magazine, and called Dalits to a return to Adi-Dharma as the original religion of Indians. Achhutanand formulated his philosophy on the basis of a shared cultural and ethnic identity, presenting it to an audience beyond the Dalits and including tribal societies as well. He opposed the non-cooperation movement of Mahatma Gandhi, his fasts and Indian National Congress, stating that the Brahmins were \\"as foreign to India as were the British\\", according to Anand Teltumbde.[18]\\r\\nBabu Mangu Ram was also born in an untouchable family of Punjab with a flourishing leather trade. Mangu Ram arrived in the United States in 1909, at age 23 and worked in California. There he joined the Ghadar Party, smuggling weapons from California to India to oppose the British rule.[18] In 1925, he shifted his focus to Dalit freedom, for which he launched the \\"Ad Dharm\\" movement as well as Adi-Danka weekly newspaper to spread his ideas. His religious movement failed to accomplish much, states Teltumbde, and Mangu Ram later joined the Ambedkar movement.[18]\\r\\nIn 1914, Prakash was ordained Bodhanand Mahastavir in Calcutta, and began preaching Buddhism in Lucknow. He founded the Bharatiye Buddh Samiti in 1916, and set up a vihara in 1928.[19]\\r\\nIn 1898, Pandit Iyothee Thass founded the Sakya Buddhist Society, also known as Indian Buddhist Association, in Tamil Nadu.[20] He presented Buddhism as a religious alternative for the Dalits. Thass' efforts created a broad movement amongst Tamil Dalits in South India till the 1950s.[19] The first president of the Indian Buddhist Association was Paul Carus.[19] The Indian Buddhist Association, unlike the Dalit movement led by Ambedkar, adopted the Theravada Buddhism tradition found in Sri Lanka, where Thass had received his training and initiation in Buddhism.[20]\\r\\nAmbedkar was a Dalit leader, influential during the colonial era and post-independence period of India. He was the fourteenth child in an impoverished Maharashtra Dalit family, who studied abroad, returned to India in the 1920s and joined the political movement. His focus was social and political rights of the Dalits.[21]\\r\\nDuring 1931-32, Mahatma Gandhi led Indian independence movement held discussions with the British government over the Round Table Conferences. They sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians.[22] The British side sought reforms that would keep Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions.[23] They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables.[22] Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule.[24][25]\\r\\nAfter Gandhi returned from Second Round Table conference, he started a new satyagraha. He was immediately arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It came to be known as the Communal Award.[26] In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison.[27] The resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.[28][29]\\r\\nAmbedkar accepted the Poona Pact under public pressure, but disagreed with Gandhi and his political methods. He dismissed Gandhi's ideas as loved by \\"blind Hindu devotees\\", primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and \\"there is always some simpleton to preach them\\".[30][31]\\r\\nAmbedkar concluded that Dalits must leave Hinduism and convert to another religion, and announced his intent to leave Hinduism in 1935. He considered Islam, Christianity, Sikhism and Buddhism.[21][32] Ambedkar was approached by various leaders of different denominations and faiths. On 22 May 1936, an \\"All Religious Conference\\" was held at Lucknow. It was attended by prominent Dalit leaders including Jagjivan Ram, though Ambedkar could not attend it. At the conference, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, and Buddhist representatives presented the tenets of their respective religions in an effort to win over Dalits.[19] Ambedkar rejected the other religions and chose Buddhism.[21] However, Ambedkar remained a Hindu for next 20 years, studied then re-interpreted Buddhism, and adopted Neo-Buddhism or Navayana few weeks before his death.[7][21]\\r\\nThe Italian Buddhist monk Lokanatha visited Ambedkar's residence at Dadar on 10 June 1936. Later in an interview to the press, Lokanatha said that Ambedkar was impressed with Buddhism.[33]\\r\\nAccording to Ambedkar, several of the core beliefs and doctrines of traditional Buddhist traditions such as Four Noble Truths and Anatta were flawed and pessimistic, may have been inserted into the Buddhist scriptures by wrong headed Buddhist monks of a later era. These should not be considered as Buddha's teachings in Ambedkar's view.[32][34] Other foundational concepts of Buddhism such as Karma and Rebirth were considered by Ambedkar as superstitions.[32]\\r\\nNavayana as formulated by Ambedkar and at the root of Dalit Buddhist movement abandons mainstream traditional Buddhist practices and precepts such as the institution of monk after renunciation, ideas such as karma, rebirth in afterlife, samsara, meditation, nirvana and Four Noble Truths.[35] Ambedkar's new sect of Buddhism rejected these ideas and re-interpreted the Buddha's religion in terms of class struggle and social equality.[34][32][36]\\r\\nAmbedkar called his version of Buddhism Navayana or Neo-Buddhism.[37] His book, The Buddha and His Dhamma is the holy book of Navayana and Dalit Buddhists.[38] According to Junghare, for the followers of Navyana, Ambedkar has become a deity and he is worshipped in its practice.[39]\\r\\nAfter publishing a series of books and articles arguing that Buddhism was the only way for the Untouchables to gain equality, Ambedkar publicly converted on 14 October 1956, at Deekshabhoomi, Nagpur, over 20 years after he declared his intent to convert and a few weeks before his death. Ambedkar adopted Navayana Buddhism, and converted between 380,000 and 500,000 Dalits to his Neo-Buddhism movement.[7][21]\\r\\nThe conversion ceremony was attended by Medharathi, his main disciple Bhoj Dev Mudit, and Mahastvir Bodhanand's Sri Lankan successor, Bhante Pragyanand.[19] Ambedkar asked Dalits not to get entangled in the existing branches of Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana), and called his version Navayana or 'Neo-Buddhism'. Ambedkar would die less than two months later, just after finishing his definitive work on Buddhism.\\r\\nMany Dalits employ the term \\"Ambedkar(ite) Buddhism\\" to designate the Buddhist movement, which started with Ambedkar's conversion.[19] Many converted people call themselves \\"-Bauddha\\" i.e. Buddhists.\\r\\nAfter receiving ordination, Ambedkar gave dhamma diksha to his followers. The ceremony included 22 vows given to all new converts after Three Jewels and Five Precepts. On 14 October 1956 at Nagpur, Ambedkar performed another mass religious conversion ceremony at Chandrapur.[40][41]\\r\\nHe prescribed 22 vows to his followers:[42]\\r\\nThe Buddhist movement was somewhat hindered by Ambedkar's death so shortly after his conversion. It did not receive the immediate mass support from the Untouchable population that Ambedkar had hoped for. Division and lack of direction among the leaders of the Ambedkarite movement have been an additional impediment. According to the 2001 census, there are currently 7.95 million Buddhists in India, at least 5.83 million of whom are Buddhists in Maharashtra.[43] This makes Buddhism the fifth-largest religion in India and 6% of the population of Maharashtra, but less than 1% of the overall population of India.\\r\\nThe Buddhist revival remains concentrated in two states: Ambedkar's native Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh  the land of Bodhanand Mahastavir, Acharya Medharthi and their associates.\\r\\nAcharya Medharthi retired from his Buddhapuri school in 1960, and shifted to an ashram in Haridwar. He turned to the Arya Samaj and conducted Vedic yajnas all over India. After his death, he was cremated according to Arya Samaj rites.[19] His Buddhpuri school became embroiled in property disputes. His follower, Bhoj Dev Mudit, converted to Buddhism in 1968 and set up a school of his own.\\r\\nRajendranath Aherwar appeared as an important Dalit leader in Kanpur. He joined the Republican Party of India and converted to Buddhism along with his whole family in 1961. In 1967, he founded the Kanpur branch of \\"Bharatiya Buddh Mahasabha\\". He held regular meetings where he preached Buddhism, officiated at Buddhist weddings and life cycle ceremonies, and organised festivals on Ambedkar's Jayanti (birth day), Sambuddhatva jayanthi, Diksha Divas (the day Ambedkar converted), and Ambedkar Paranirvan Divas (the day Ambedkar died).[19]\\r\\nThe Dalit Buddhist movement in Kanpur gained impetus with the arrival of Dipankar, a Chamar bhikkhu, in 1980. Dipankar had come to Kanpur on a Buddhist mission and his first public appearance was scheduled at a mass conversion drive in 1981. The event was organised by Rahulan Ambawadekar, an RPI Dalit leader. In April 1981, Ambawadekar founded the Dalit Panthers (U.P. Branch) inspired by the Maharashtrian Dalit Panthers. The event met with severe criticism and opposition from Vishva Hindu Parishad and was banned.[19]\\r\\nThe number of Buddhists in the Lucknow district increased from 73 in 1951 to 4327 in 2001.[44] According to the 2001 census, almost 70% of the Buddhist population in Uttar Pradesh is from the scheduled castes background.[45]\\r\\nIn 2002, Kanshi Ram, a popular political leader from a Sikh religious background, announced his intention to convert to Buddhism on 14 October 2006, the fiftieth anniversary of Ambedkar's conversion. He intended for 20,000,000 of his supporters to convert at the same time.[citation needed] Part of the significance of this plan was that Ram's followers include not only Untouchables, but persons from a variety of castes, who could significantly broaden Buddhism's support. But, he died 9 October 2006[46] after a lengthy illness; he was cremated as per Buddhist tradition.[47]\\r\\nAnother popular Dalit leader, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati, has said that she and her followers will embrace Buddhism after the BSP forms a government at the Centre.[48]\\r\\nJapanese-born Surai Sasai emerged as an important Buddhist leader in India. Sasai came to India in 1966 and met Nichidatsu Fuji, whom he helped with the Peace Pagoda at Rajgir. He fell out with Fuji, however, and started home, but, by his own account, was stopped by a dream in which a figure resembling Nagarjuna appeared and said, \\"Go to Nagpur\\". In Nagpur, he met Wamanrao Godbole, the person who had organised the conversion ceremony for Ambedkar in 1956. Sasai claims that when he saw a photograph of Ambedkar at Godbole's home, he realised that it was Ambedkar who had appeared in his dream. At first, Nagpur folk considered Surai Sasai very strange. Then he began to greet them with \\"Jai Bhim\\" (victory to Ambedkar) and to build viharas. In 1987 a court case to deport him on the grounds that he had overstayed his visa was dismissed, and he was granted Indian citizenship. Sasai and Bhante Anand Agra are two of main leaders of the campaign to free the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya from Hindu control.[49]\\r\\nA movement originating in Maharashtra but also active in Uttar Pradesh, and spread out over quite a few other pockets where Neo Buddhists live, is Triratna Bauddha Mahsa?gha (formerly called TBMSG for Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Sahayaka Gana). It is the Indian wing of the UK-based Triratna Buddhist Community founded by Sangharakshita. Its roots lie in the scattered contacts that Sangharakshita had in the 1950s with Ambedkar. Sangharakshita, then still a bhikshu, participated in the conversion movement from 1956 until his departure to the UK in 1963.\\r\\nWhen his new ecumenical movement had gained enough ground in the West, Sangharakshita worked with Ambedkarites in India and the UK to develop Indian Buddhism further. After visits in the late 1970s by Dharmachari Lokamitra from UK, supporters developed a two-pronged approach: social work through the Bahujan Hitaj (also spelled as Bahujan Hitay) trust, mainly sponsored from the general public by the British Buddhist-inspired Karuna Trust (UK), and direct Dharma work. Currently the movement has viharas and groups in at least 20 major areas, a couple of retreat centres, and hundreds of Indian Dharmacharis and Dharmacharinis.[50]\\r\\nFunding for movement's social and dharma work has come from foreign countries, including the Western countries and Taiwan. Some of the foreign-funded organisations include Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Sahayaka Gana[51] and Triratna (Europe and India). Triratna has links with the 'Ambedkarite' Buddhist Romanis in Hungary.[52]\\r\\nSince Ambedkar's conversion, several thousand people from different castes have converted to Buddhism in ceremonies including the twenty-two vows. The Tamil Nadu and Gujarat governments passed new laws in 2003 to ban \\"forced\\" religious conversions.\\r\\nCritics have argued that efforts to convert Hindus to Ambedkarite Buddhism are political stunts rather than sincere commitments to social reform.[60][61] On May 2011, Vishwesha Teertha, stated that conversion doesn't add any benefit to status of dalits.[62]\\r\\nOn 17 June 2013, the converted Dalits asked for the Buddhist certificates, that has been delayed.[63]\\r\\nAccording to Gail Omvedt, an American-born and naturalised Indian sociologist and human rights activist?:\\r\\nAmbedkar's Buddhism seemingly differs from that of those who accepted by faith, who 'go for refuge' and accept the canon. This much is clear from its basis: it does not accept in totality the scriptures of the Theravada, the Mahayana, or the Vajrayana. The question that is then clearly put forth: is a fourth yana, a Navayana, a kind of modernistic Enlightenment version of the Dhamma really possible within the framework of Buddhism?[64]\\r\\nAccording to Omvedt, Ambedkar and his Buddhist movement deny many of the core doctrines of Buddhism.[4] All the elements of religious modernism, state Christopher Queen and Sallie King, may be found in Ambedkar Buddhism where his The Buddha and His Dhamma abandons the traditional precepts and practices, then adopts science, activism and social reforms as a form of Engaged Buddhism.[65] Ambedkar's formulation of Buddhism is different from Western modernism, states Skaria, given his synthesis of the ideas of modern Karl Marx into the structure of ideas by the ancient Buddha.[66]","input":"Who was the leader of the dalit movement in india?"},{"output":"14,938,948","context":"The Carolinas are the U.S. states of North Carolina and South Carolina, considered collectively. They are bordered by Virginia to the north, Tennessee to the west, and Georgia to the southwest. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east. Combining North Carolina's Clusters population of 10,042,802 and South Carolina's of 4,896,146, the Carolinas have a population of 14,938,948 as of 2015. If the Carolinas were a single state of the United States, it would be the fifth-most populous state, behind California, Texas, Florida, and New York. The Carolinas were known as the Province of Carolina during America's early colonial period, from 1663 to 1710. Prior to that, the land was considered part of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, from 1609 to 1663. The province, named Carolina to honor King Charles I of England, was divided into two colonies in 1729, although the actual date is the subject of debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region was claimed as part of the Spanish territory named La Florida by Ponce de Leon in 1513. Santa Elena, a Spanish settlement on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina, was the capital of La Florida from 1566 to 1587. It was founded by Pedro Menndez de Avils, the first governor of Spanish Florida.[1][2] There had been a number of earlier attempts to establish colonies in the area by both the Spanish and the French, who had been inspired by earlier accounts of the plentiful land of Chicora.[3]  Menndez's Santa Elena settlement shifted the focus of Spanish colonial efforts northward from St. Augustine, which had been established in 1565 to drive the French from their colony of Fort Caroline. Santa Elena was ultimately built at the site of the abandoned French outpost of Charlesfort, founded in 1562 by Jean Ribault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe establishment of Santa Elena followed the destruction of the French Fort Caroline by Menndez in 1565. The Spanish settlement housed a sizeable community, and became the base of operations for the Jesuits and military working in the northern zone of Spanish Florida. From this base the Spanish founded a number of other ephemeral forts as far inland as the Appalachian Mountains, but resistance from local Native American tribes and the lack of interest of Spain in the area, caused these to be abandoned, relocated or destroyed. Santa Elena was ultimately abandoned in 1587, with its survivors relocating to St. Augustine. The Spanish never pressed their colonial claims to the area again, focusing on other areas of the American continent. The territory was thereafter left to the native Americans until October 30, 1629, when Charles I granted a patent to his attorney-general, Sir Robert Heath, for the lands south of 36 degrees and north of 31 degrees, \\"under the name, in honor of that king, of Carolana\\".[4]\\"[5] Carolus is Latin for 'Charles'. The charter was unrealized and later ruled invalid.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 24, 1663, Charles II issued a new charter to a group of eight English noblemen, granting them the land of Carolina, as a reward for their faithful support of his efforts to regain the throne of England. The eight were called Lords Proprietor or simply Proprietors. The 1663 charter granted the Lords Proprietor title to all of the land from the southern border of the Virginia Colony at 36 degrees north to 31 degrees north (along the coast of present-day Georgia).[6] The establishment of separate colonies did not officially occur until 1729, when seven of the Lords Proprietors sold their interests in Carolina to the Crown, and both North Carolina and South Carolina became royal colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1665, the charter was revised slightly, with the northerly boundary extended to 36 degrees 30 minutes north to include the lands of the Albemarle Settlements along the Albemarle Sound, which had been settled mainly by Virginians migrating south. Likewise, the southern boundary was moved south to 29 degrees north, just south of present-day Daytona Beach, Florida, which had the effect of including the existing Spanish settlement at St. Augustine, an unenforceable overreach of English power. The charter also granted all the land, between these northerly and southerly bounds, from the Atlantic Ocean, westward to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, an even more unenforceable overreach.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1663 and 1729 there were many disagreements relating to defense, governance and the difference between the two differing agrarian styles employed by the inhabitants of the Colony of Virginia and that practiced by the planters arriving to Charles Town from the West Indies and Barbados.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1729 the Province of Carolina was divided when the descendants of seven of the eight Lords Proprietors sold their shares back to the Crown. Only the heirs of Sir George Carteret retained their original rights to what would become the Granville District. Both the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina became British Crown Colonies in 1729.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe culture of the Carolinas is a distinct subset of larger Southern culture. Notably, the coastal Carolina region was settled by Europeans over a century before the inland regions of the South,[8] and was influenced by the culture of the Caribbean, especially Barbados; many of the early governors during the unified period were Barbadians.[9]  Though the two states both form part of the South, there are historically a number of differences in the settlement patterns, political development, and economic growth of the two states. For example, during the Civil War, South Carolina was the first Southern state to secede from the Union,[10] while North Carolina was the last state to secede. When North Carolina did secede, it did so largely because North Carolinians refused to provide the federal government men to fight against their sister state, or to allow them passage through North Carolina to make war on South Carolina. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the war, South Carolina was generally one of the strongest supporters of the Confederacy. The war began in Charleston, South Carolina, where cadets of the South Carolina Military Academy, known as The Citadel, fired the opening shots at the Union Ship Star of the West.[11] North Carolina was also a key Confederate state, raising and giving more soldiers to The Confederacy than any other southern state.[12] At Gettysburg, one in four Confederate soldiers was from North Carolina,  despite the fact that some North Carolinians (especially in the western part of the state) refused to support the Confederacy.[13] North Carolina's Civil War governor, Zebulon Vance, was an outspoken critic of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and frequently refused to obey Davis's orders for reinforcements and supplies; Vance insisted the soldiers and supplies would be needed for North Carolina's Confederate effort. However, during the seven days' battles, North Carolina did send large numbers of troops for the general aid of the South as a whole.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carolinas were both instrumental in keeping the Confederacy alive, because of their deepwater ports in Wilmington and Charleston. These two cities were key in supplying southern armies with weapons, clothing, and ammunition, and producing food and provisions for southern civilians.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring most of the 20th century, South Carolina was a bastion of the \\"solid Democratic South\\" with almost no Republican officeholders, and the state frequently elected politicians who were outspoken supporters of racial segregation. North Carolina, while mostly Democratic, contained a large Republican minority ÿ the state voted Republican in the presidential election of 1928 and elected several Republican congressmen, governors, and senators from 1868ÿ1928 ÿ and North Carolina was widely known as one of the more progressive Southern states on the issue of segregation and civil rights. In 1947, the journalist John Gunther wrote, \\"that North Carolina is by a good deal the most progressive Southern state will, I imagine, be agreed to by almost everybody.\\"[17] On the other hand, he described South Carolina as \\"one of the poorest American states, and probably one of the balkiest.\\"[18] In describing the differences between the two states, Gunther noted that, in 1947, divorce in North Carolina \\"may be granted simply on the ground of absence of cohabitation; South Carolina is the one American state in which divorce is not possible.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite North Carolina being a swing state in presidential elections, and South Carolina being one that reliably votes for Republican presidential candidates, they are technically the country's two most politically similar states, according to a comparison of the states along a range of 19 variables performed by the statistician Nate Silver in 2008.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, like much of the South, the Carolinas have been agricultural.[20]  However, the predominance of certain crops has influenced the regional economy:\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other [Southern] states, until after World War II North Carolina remained primarily a region of small farms and factories heavily dependent on just a few labor-intensive crops, relying on sharecropping and tenancy, especially for black laborers. The Carolinas are distinct for their economic dependence on tobacco as well as on cotton and rice, and for their many small-scale furniture, textile, and tobacco factories.[21]\\r\\nThese small industries gave the Carolinas, particularly North Carolina, a more significant industrial base than most Southern states, but as increased mechanization in the textiles, apparel, and furniture industries combined with the decline of the tobacco industry,[22] many rural and small urban communities suffered.[23]  However, during the 1990s, both states began to experience growth in the technological and banking sectors, bringing jobs and population growth.[24]  These changes, as with earlier industrialization, were more pronounced in North Carolina, and South Carolina has experienced a slower rate of economic growth for several years.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carolinas have three professional sports teams in the Big Four major leagues: the Carolina Panthers of the NFL, the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA, and the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL. Supported by both states, the three teams are all based in NC, two in Charlotte and the third in Raleigh. All of the sports teams are fairly recent additions; the oldest team, the NFL's Panthers, was established in 1995, while the youngest, the Hornets, was added to the NBA in 2004 as the Charlotte Bobcats, although a prior NBA team also named the Hornets played in Charlotte from 1988 before leaving for New Orleans in 2002. The Bobcats were renamed the Hornets in May 2014, one season after the former New Orleans Hornets decided to rebrand themselves as the Pelicans. At that time, the Hornets also regained sole ownership of the pre-relocation history of the original Charlotte Hornets. The Hurricanes formed in 1971 as the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association. After the NHL-WHA merger in 1979, they joined the NHL as the Hartford Whalers until 1997 when they relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina. Currently, the Hurricanes are the most successful after their 2006 Stanley Cup championship marked the first professional sports title for the region. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, Charlotte was the host city of the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, which was held at the now demolished Charlotte Coliseum. \\r\\nOn May 24, 2017, Charlotte was awarded to be the host city of the 2019 NBA All-Star Game. The game is set to be held on February 17, 2019 at the  Spectrum Center,  home of the Charlotte Hornets. The game is expected to be one of the biggest sporting events to ever come to Charlotte. Bank of America Stadium currently hosts three major sporting events, the Belk Bowl,  the Belk Kickoff Game and the ACC Championship Game. Charlotte Motor Speedway hosts three major NASCAR events, the Coca-Cola 600, the Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race,  and the Bank of America 500.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carolinas are home to a number of NBA superstars, such as Chris Paul, James Worthy, John Wall, and Michael Jordan (from NC) and Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Ray Allen, and Raymond Felton (from SC). Six of these players are All Stars, four are NBA champions, and John Wall and James Worthy were the Number 1 draft picks in the 2010 NBA draft and 1982 NBA draft, respectively. A disproportional number of basketball players come from the Carolinas, on par with such big cities as New York City and Los Angeles. While the Hornets do little to generate buzz in the Carolinas, they are home to three of the most successful collegiate men's basketball teams in the NCAA, the North Carolina Tar Heels, North Carolina State Wolfpack and the Duke Blue Devils. All three schools are fierce rivals who have combined to win 13 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships (UNC has 6, Duke has 5, North Carolina State has 2).\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Prefatory Notes to Volume 5 of the Colonial Records of North Carolina, the process of determining the boundary between North and South Carolina began in 1720 \\"when the purpose to erect a\\r\\nthird Province in Carolina, with Savannah for its northern boundary\\"[26] began. On 8 January 1730[27] an agreement between the two colonies said for the border \\"to begin 30 miles southwest of the Cape Fear river, and to be run at that parallel distance the whole course of said river;\\" The next June Governor Robert Johnson of South Carolina said the border should start 30 miles southwest of the source of the Cape Fear \\"due west as far as the South Sea\\", unless the \\"Waccamaw river lyes [sic] within 30 miles of the Cape Fear river,\\"[26] which would make the Waccamaw the boundary. North Carolina agreed to this until the discovery that the Cape Fear headwaters were very close to Virginia, which would not have \\"permitted any extension on the part of North Carolina to the westward.\\"[26]  In 1732, Governor George Burrington of North Carolina stated in Timothy's Southern Gazette that territory north of the Waccamaw was in North Carolina, to which Johnson replied that South Carolina claimed the land. Johnson also said that when the two met before the Board of Trade in London two years earlier, Burrington had \\"insisted that the Waccamaw should be the boundary from its mouth to its head,\\"[26] while South Carolina agreed the border should be located 30 miles from the mouth, not the source. Johnson said this was \\"only a mistake in wording it.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Carolinas selected commissioners to survey the line between them. The plan called for the line to run northwest to 35 degrees latitude, unless the Pee Dee River was reached first, in which case it would run along the Pee Dee to 35 degrees north. Then the line would run west to Catawba town, though if the town were north of the line, the line was to run around Catawba to keep it in South Carolina.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1735, the surveyors went from the Cape Fear westward thirty miles along the coast. Then they turned northwest and marked the location with stakes. The surveyors agreed to meet again on September 18. However, only the North Carolina team returned at that time, extending the line northwest 70 miles. The South Carolina team arrived in October and only followed the previous line for 40 miles because they had not been paid. A deputy surveyor marked where the Pee Dee crossed the 35th parallel. An extension of the line in 1737 ran 22 miles to a stake in a meadow.[26]  However, the stake placed at the endpoint of the survey was 12 miles too far south.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1764, a second extension ran 62 miles westward. In 1772, after making adjustments to keep the Catawba Indians in South Carolina, \\"extended in a due west course from the confluence of the north and south forks of the Catawba River to Tryon Mountain.\\"[26] However, this extension was based on the erroneous position of the 1737 stake, removing 422,000 acres from South Carolina.[28] Joseph Caldwell, president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, found that the line west of the Pee Dee did not run along the 35th parallel, but 12 miles to the south. However, the western part of the line ran far enough to the north to make up for the difference.[26] West of this point the border was shifted to run north of the 35th parallel so that the total areas of the states would return to what was intended, although the accuracy of this part of the survey was marred by a magnetic anomaly in the Charlotte, North Carolina area.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Carolina did not agree to the line of 1772 until 1813.[26] A 1905 survey determined the border between Scotland County, North Carolina and Marlboro County, South Carolina. A 1928 survey decided the border between Horry County, South Carolina and Brunswick and Columbus counties in North Carolina.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1990s, Duke Energy determined that the border between the Carolinas needed to be re-surveyed, as the company was selling and donating land in the Jocassee Gorge area, which included parts of both states.[28] Also, with more people living outside cities, the precise boundaries of fire, tax, and school district lines needed to be known. This was especially a problem in the mountains, where people had previously lived in valleys, not on the ridges where the border was. A 15-year plan to re-establish the boundary began, using maps from the 1813ÿ1815 survey and GPS technology. A few stone markers still read, \\"NC/SC 1815 AD\\"[30] but other locations were marked with trees which no longer stand.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Carolina had recently been involved in a costly legal battle with Georgia over a small number of islands in the Savannah River, and wanted to avoid the expense of a lawsuit regarding the North Carolina border, so the two states agreed in 1993 to cooperate in resurveying the border.  The effort included using colonial-era maps to reconstruct the positions of trees making the border that had long since died, and tracking down the original positions of stone markers that had been moved.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 18 years and $980,000, it was predicted that the process of determining the border between the Carolinas would be complete in 2012.[29] Financial problems delayed the last survey until October 2012, meaning the results were not expected to be known until Spring 2013.[31] It was found that a gas station and 30 homes could change states. Lake Wylie Mini Market[32][33][34][35][36][37] has been located in South Carolina, along U.S. Route 321, and the move to North Carolina would result in higher gas taxes and change laws on beer and fireworks.[38] The state legislatures involved expect to pass laws alleviating the concerns those changing states would face.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Joint Boundary Commission met in February 2014 in Monroe, North Carolina to determine what actions still needed to be taken. The persons living in 50 homes that changed states would have to get driver's licenses and register to vote in their new states. Legislative action could allow people to keep utilities, avoid back taxes to the new state, and continue in the same schools. Lake Wylie Minimarket could be grandfathered, or Congress could change the defined border at the store's location, though the commission intended to avoid such an action.[39] As of August 2014, the states were expected to pass legislation to mitigate many of the negative impacts to affected landowners.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 1, 2016, the South Carolina House of Representatives passed a bill setting the border. North Carolina's Senate also passed a bill, which also had to clear the House. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed his state's bill in June. Three families who actually lived in North Carolina had South Carolina addresses, and 16 South Carolina residents had believed they lived in North Carolina.[40][41] On December 9, 2016, McCrory announced that he signed a four-page executive order formally defining the border between the two states based on the 20 years of work.[41]","input":"What is the population of north and south carolina?"},{"output":"September 22, 1823","context":" Book of Mormon portal\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Latter Day Saint belief, the golden plates (also called the gold plates or in some 19th-century literature, the golden bible)[1] are the source from which Joseph Smith said he translated the Book of Mormon, a sacred text of the faith.[2] Some witnesses described the plates as weighing from 30 to 60 pounds (14 to 27?kg),[3] being golden in color and being composed of thin metallic pages engraved on both sides and bound with three D-shaped rings.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith said he found the plates on September 22, 1823, at a Hill, near his home in Manchester, New York, after the angel Moroni directed him to a buried stone box. Smith said the angel at first prevented him from taking the plates but instructed him to return to the same location in a year. In September 1827, on his fourth annual attempt to retrieve the plates, Smith returned home with a heavy object wrapped in a frock, which he then put in a box. Though he allowed others to heft the box, he said that the angel had forbidden him to show the plates to anyone until they had been translated from their original \\"reformed Egyptian\\" language. Smith dictated the text of the Book of Mormon over the next several years, claiming that it was a translation of the plates. He did so by using a seer stone, which he placed in the bottom of a hat and then placed the hat over his face to view the words written within the stone.[5] Smith published the translation in 1830 as the Book of Mormon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith eventually obtained testimonies from eleven men, known as the Book of Mormon witnesses, who said they had seen the plates.[6] After the translation was complete, Smith said he returned the plates to the angel Moroni. Therefore, the plates cannot be examined. Latter Day Saints believe the account of the golden plates as a matter of faith, and critics often assert that either Smith manufactured the plates himself[7] or that the Book of Mormon witnesses based their testimony on visions rather than physical experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the words of Mormon historian Richard Bushman, \\"For most modern readers, the [golden] plates are beyond belief, a phantasm, yet the Mormon sources accept them as fact.\\"[8] Because Smith said he returned the plates to the angel Moroni after he finished translating them, their authenticity cannot be determined by physical examination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe golden plates were reportedly shown to several close associates of Smith.[9] Mormon scholars have formed collaborations such as Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies to provide apologetic answers to critical research about the golden plates and topics in the field of Mormon studies. Among the topics, the credibility of the plates has been, according to Bushman, a \\"troublesome item.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of Mormon itself portrays the golden plates as a historical record, engraved by two pre-Columbian prophet-historians from around the year AD 400: Mormon and his son Moroni.[11] Mormon and Moroni, the book says, had abridged earlier historical records from other sets of metal plates. Their script, according to the book, was described as \\"reformed Egyptian,\\" a language unknown to linguists or Egyptologists.[12] Scholarly reference works on languages do not acknowledge the existence of either a \\"reformed Egyptian\\" language or \\"reformed Egyptian\\" script as it has been described in Mormon belief. No archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in ancient America has been discovered.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, Latter Day Saint movement denominations have taught that the Book of Mormon's description of the plates' origin is accurate, and that the Book of Mormon is a translation of the plates.[14] The Community of Christ, however, while accepting the Book of Mormon as scripture, no longer takes an official position on the historicity of the golden plates.[15] Moreover, even in the more theologically conservative Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), some adherents who accept the Book of Mormon as inspired scripture do not believe it is a literal translation of a physical historical record.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-believers and some liberal Mormons have advanced naturalistic explanations for the story of the plates. For example, it has been theorized that the plates were fashioned by Smith or one of his associates,[17] that Smith had the ability to convince others of their existence through illusions or hypnosis,[18] or that witnesses were having ecstatic visions.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the golden plates consists of how, according to Joseph Smith and his contemporaries, the plates were found, received from the angel Moroni, translated, and returned to the angel before the publication of the Book of Mormon. Smith is the only source for a great deal of the story because much of it occurred while he was the only human witness. Nevertheless, Smith told the story to his family, friends, and acquaintances, and many of them provided second-hand accounts. Other parts of the story are derived from the statements of those who knew Smith, including several witnesses who said that they saw the golden plates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-known elements of the golden plates story are found in an account told by Smith in 1838 and incorporated into the official church histories of some Latter Day Saint movement denominations.[20] The LDS Church has canonized part of this 1838 account as part of its scripture, the Pearl of Great Price.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Second Great Awakening, Joseph Smith lived on his parents' farm near Palmyra, New York. At the time, churches in the region contended so vigorously for souls that western New York later became known as the \\"burned-over district\\" because the fires of religious revivals had burned over it so often.[21] Western New York was also noted for its participation in a \\"craze for treasure hunting\\".[22] Beginning as a youth in the early 1820s, Smith was periodically hired, for about $14 per month, as a scryer, using what were termed \\"seer stones\\" in attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure.[23] Smith's contemporaries described his method for seeking treasure as putting the stone in a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, and then \\"seeing\\" the information in the reflections of the stone.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith did not consider himself to be a \\"peeper\\" or \\"glass-looker\\", a practice he called \\"nonsense\\".[25] Rather, Smith and his family viewed their folk magical practices as spiritual gifts.[26] Although Smith later rejected his youthful treasure-hunting activities as frivolous and immaterial, he never repudiated the stones themselves,  denied their presumed power to find treasure, or ever relinquish the magic culture in which he was raised.[27] He came to view seeing with a stone in religious terms as the work of a \\"seer\\".[28] Smith's first stone, apparently the same one that he used at least part of the time to translate the golden plates, was chocolate-colored and about the size of a chicken egg,[29] found in a deep well he helped dig for one of his neighbors.[30] The LDS Church released photographs of the stone on August 4, 2015.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Smith, he found the plates after he was directed to them by a heavenly messenger[33] whom he later identified as the angel Moroni.[34] According to the story, the angel first visited Smith's bedroom late at night, on September 22[35] in 1822 or 1823.[36] Moroni told Smith that the plates could be found buried in a prominent hill near his home, later called Cumorah, a name found in the Book of Mormon.[37] Before dawn, Moroni reappeared two more times and repeated the information.[38]\\r\\nHowever, the angel would not allow Smith to take the plates until he obeyed certain \\"commandments\\".[39] Smith recorded some of these commandments but made it clear the main thrust of Moroni's message was that he had to keep God's commandments in general. Some contemporaries who later claimed he told them the story said there were others, some of which are relevant to the modern debate about whether or how closely events of early Mormonism were related to the practice of contemporary folk magic.[40] Smith's writings say that the angel required at least the following: (1) that he have no thought of using the plates for monetary gain,[41] (2) that he tell his father about the vision,[42] and (3) that he never show the plates to any unauthorized person.[43] Smith's contemporaries who claimed to have heard the story, both sympathetic and unsympathetic, generally agreed that Smith mentioned the following additional commandments: (4) that Smith take the plates and leave the site in which they had been buried without looking back,[44] and (5) that the plates never directly touch the ground until they were safe at home in a locked chest.[45] Some unsympathetic listeners who allegedly heard the story from Smith or his father recalled that Smith had said the angel required him (6) to wear \\"black clothes\\" to the place where the plates were buried,[46] (7) to ride a \\"black horse with a switchtail\\",[47] (8) to call for the plates by a certain name,[48] and (9) to \\"give thanks to God.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, Smith began work as usual and did not mention the visions to his father[50] because, he said, he did not think his father would believe him.[51] Smith said he then fainted because he had been awake all night, and while unconscious, the angel appeared a fourth time and chastised him for failing to tell the visions to his father.[52] When Smith then told all to his father, he believed his son and encouraged him to obey the angel's commands.[53] Smith then set off to visit the hill, later stating that he used his seer stone to locate the place that the plates were buried[54] but that he \\"knew the place the instant that [he] arrived there.\\"[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith said he saw a large stone covering a box made of stone (or possibly iron).[56] Using a stick to remove dirt from the edges of the stone cover and prying it up with a lever,[57] Smith saw the plates inside the box, together with other artifacts.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Smith's followers, Smith said he took the plates from the box, put them on the ground, and covered the box with the stone to protect the other treasures that it contained.[59] Nevertheless, the accounts say that when Smith looked back at the ground after closing the box, the plates had once again disappeared into it.[60] When Smith once again raised the stone and attempted to retrieve the plates, he said that he was stricken by a supernatural force that hurled him to the ground as many as three times.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisconcerted by his inability to obtain the plates, Smith said he briefly wondered whether his experience had been a \\"dreem of Vision\\" [sic].[62] Concluding that it was not, he said he prayed to ask why he had been barred from taking the plates.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to his question, Smith said the angel appeared and told him he could not receive the plates because he \\"had been tempted of the advisary and saught the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have an eye single to the Glory of God\\" [sic].[64] According to Smith's followers, Smith had also broken the angel's commandment \\"not to lay the plates down, or put them for a moment out of his hands,\\"[65] and according to a nonbeliever, Smith said, \\"I had forgotten to give thanks to God,\\" as required by the angel.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith said the angel instructed him to return the next year, on September 22, 1824, with the \\"right person\\": his older brother Alvin.[67] Alvin died in November 1823, and Smith returned to the hill in 1824 to ask what he should do.[68] Smith said he was told to return the following year (1825) with the \\"right person\\" but the angel did not tell Smith who that person might be.[69] However, Smith determined after looking into his seer stone that the \\"right person\\" was Emma Hale, his future wife.[70] For the visit on September 22, 1825, Smith may have attempted to bring his treasure-hunting associate Samuel T. Lawrence.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith said that he visited the hill \\"at the end of each year\\" for four years after the first visit in 1823,[72] but there is no record of him being in the vicinity of Palmyra between January 1826 and January 1827, when he returned to New York from Pennsylvania with his new wife.[73] In January 1827, Smith visited the hill and then told his parents that the angel had severely chastised him for not being \\"engaged enough in the work of the Lord,\\"[74] which may have meant that he had missed his annual visit to the hill in 1826.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next annual visit on September 22, 1827 would be, Smith told associates, his last chance to receive the plates.[76] According to Brigham Young, as the scheduled final date to obtain the plates approached, several Palmyra residents expressed concern \\"that they were going to lose that treasure\\" and sent for a skilled necromancer from 60 miles (96?km) away, encouraging him to make three separate trips to Palmyra to find the plates.[77] During one of the trips, the unnamed necromancer is said to have discovered the location but was unable to determine the value of the plates.[78] A few days prior to the September 22, 1827 visit to the hill, Smith's loyal treasure-hunting friends Josiah Stowell and Joseph Knight, Sr. traveled to Palmyra, in part, to be there during Smith's scheduled visit to the hill.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother of Smith's former treasure-hunting associates, Samuel T. Lawrence, was also apparently aware of the approaching date to obtain the plates, and Smith was concerned that he might cause trouble.[80] Therefore, on the eve of September 22, 1827, the scheduled date for retrieving the plates, Smith dispatched his father to spy on Lawrence's house until dark. If Lawrence attempted to leave, the elder Smith was to tell him that his son would \\"thrash the stumps with him\\" if he found him at the hill.[76] Late at night, Smith took a horse and carriage to the hill Cumorah with Emma.[81] While Emma stayed behind kneeling in prayer,[82] Smith walked to the site of the buried plates. Some time in the early morning hours, he said that he retrieved the plates and hid them in a hollow log on or near Cumorah.[83] At the same time, Smith said he received a pair of large spectacles he called the Urim and Thummim or \\"Interpreters,\\" with lenses consisting of two seer stones, which he showed his mother when he returned in the morning.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby Macedon to earn enough money to buy a solid lockable chest in which to put the plates.[85] By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith had said that he had been successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their share of the profits from what they viewed as part of a joint venture in treasure hunting.[86] Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith, Sr., determined that a group of ten to twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly talented seer from 60 miles (96?km) away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of divination.[87] When Emma heard of that, she rode a stray horse to Macedon and informed Smith,[88] who reportedly determined through his Urim and Thummim that the plates were safe. He nevertheless hurriedly rode home with Emma.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce home in Manchester, he said he walked to Cumorah, removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked home through the woods and away from the road with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm.[90] On the way, he said a man had sprung up from behind a log and struck him a \\"heavy blow with a gun.... Knocking the man down with a single punch, Joseph ran as fast as he could for about a half mile before he was attacked by a second man trying to get the plates. After similarly overpowering the man, Joseph continued to run, but before he reached the house, a third man hit him with a gun. In striking the last man, Joseph said, he injured his thumb.\\"[91] He returned home with a dislocated thumb and other minor injuries.[92] Smith sent his father, Joseph Knight, and Josiah Stowell to search for the pursuers, but they found no one.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith is said to have put the plates in a locked chest and hid them in his parents' home in Manchester.[94] He refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates or the other artifacts that he said he had in his possession, but some people were allowed to heft them or feel what were said to be the artifacts through a cloth.[95] A few days after retrieving the plates, Smith brought home what he said was an ancient breastplate, which he said had been hidden in the box at Cumorah with the plates. After letting his mother feel through a thin cloth what she said was the breastplate, he placed it in the locked chest.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Smith home was approached \\"nearly every night\\" by villagers hoping to find the chest, where Smith said the plates were kept.[97] After hearing that a group of them would attempt to enter the house by force, Smith buried the chest under the hearth,[98] and the family was able to scare away the intended intruders.[99] Fearing the chest might still be discovered, Smith hid it under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby that was then being used as a cooper shop.[86] Later, Smith told his mother he had taken the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards of the cooper shop, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax. Shortly thereafter the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates,[100] who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find the hiding place by looking in her seer stone.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language, and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them.[102] The translation took place mainly in Harmony, Pennsylvania (now Oakland Township), Emma's hometown, where Smith and his wife had moved in October 1827 with financial assistance from a prominent, though superstitious, Palmyra landowner Martin Harris.[103] The translation occurred in two phases: the first, from December 1827 to June 1828, during which Smith transcribed some of the characters and then dictated 116 manuscript pages to Harris, which were lost. The second phase began sporadically in early 1829 and then in earnest in April 1829 with the arrival of Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher who volunteered to serve as Smith's full-time scribe. In June 1829, Smith and Cowdery moved to Fayette, New York, completing the translation early the following month.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith used scribes to write the words he said were a translation of the golden plates, dictating the words while peering into seer stones, which he said allowed him to see the translation. Smith's translation process evolved from of his previous use of seer stones in treasure-seeking.[104] During the earliest phase of translation, Smith said he used what he called Urim and Thummim, two stones set in a frame like a set of large spectacles.[105] Witnesses said Smith placed the Urim and Thummim in his hat while he was translating.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the loss of the first 116 manuscript pages, Smith translated with a single seer stone, which some sources say he had previously used in treasure-seeking.[107] Smith placed the stone in a hat, buried his face in it to eliminate all outside light, and peered into the stone to see the words of the translation.[108] A few times during the translation, a curtain or blanket was raised between Smith and his scribe or between the living area and the area where Smith and his scribe worked.[109] Sometimes, Smith dictated to Harris from upstairs or from a different room.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith's translation did not require the use of the plates themselves.[111] Though Smith himself said very little about the translation process, his friends and family said that as he looked into the stone, the written translation of the ancient script appeared to him in English.[112] There are several proposed explanations for how Smith composed his translation. In the 19th century, the most common explanation was that he copied the work from a manuscript written by Solomon Spaulding.[113] That theory is repudiated by Smith's preeminent modern biographers.[114] The most prominent modern theory is that Smith composed the translation in response to the provincial opinions of his time,[115] perhaps while in a magical trance-like state.[116] As a matter of faith, Latter Day Saints generally view the translation process as either an automatic process of transcribing text written within the stone[117] or an intuitive translation by Smith, assisted by a mystical connection with God, through the stone.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith's dictations were written down by a number of assistants, including Emma Smith, Martin Harris, and Oliver Cowdery.[119] In May 1829, after Smith had lent 116 unduplicated manuscript pages to Harris, and Harris had lost them, Smith dictated a revelation explaining that Smith could not simply retranslate the lost pages because his opponents would attempt to see if he could \\"bring forth the same words again.\\"[120] According to Grant Palmer, Smith believed \\"a second transcription would be identical to the first. This confirms the view that the English text existed in some kind of unalterable, spiritual form rather than that someone had to think through difficult conceptual issues and idioms, always resulting in variants in any translation.\\"[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Smith and Emma moved to Pennsylvania in October 1827, they transported a wooden box, which Smith said contained the plates, hidden in a barrel of beans.[122] For a time, the couple stayed in the home of Emma's father, Isaac Hale, but when Smith refused to show Hale the plates, Hale banished the concealed objects from his house.[123] Afterward, Smith told several of his associates that the plates were hidden in the nearby woods.[124] Emma said that she remembered the plates being on a table in the house, wrapped in a linen tablecloth, which she moved from time to time when it got in the way of her chores.[125] According to Smith's mother, the plates were also stored in a trunk on Emma's bureau.[126] However, Smith did not require the physical presence of the plates to translate them.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1828, Martin Harris's wife, Lucy, visited Harmony with her husband and demanded to see the plates. When Smith refused to show them to her, she searched the house, grounds, and woods. According to Smith's mother, during the search Lucy was frightened by a large, black snake and so was prevented from digging up the plates.[128] As a result of Martin Harris's loss of the 116 pages of manuscript, Smith said that between July and September 1828, the angel Moroni took back both the plates and the Urim and Thummim as a penalty for his having delivered \\"the manuscript into the hands of a wicked man.\\"[129] According to Smith's mother, the angel returned the objects to Smith on September 22, 1828, the anniversary of the day that he first received them.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1829, Martin Harris visited Harmony and asked to see the plates. Smith told him that he \\"would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself.\\"  Harris followed the directions but could not find the plates.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early June 1829, the unwanted attentions of locals around Harmony necessitated Smith's move to the home of David Whitmer and his parents in Fayette, New York. Smith said that during this move the plates were transported by the angel Moroni, who put them in the garden of the Whitmer house, where Smith could recover them. The translation was completed at the Whitmer home.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter translation was complete, Smith said he returned the plates to the angel, but he did not elaborate about this experience.[133] According to accounts by several early Mormons, a group of Mormon leaders, including Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and possibly others[134] accompanied Smith and returned the plates to a cave inside the Hill Cumorah.[135] There, Smith is said to have placed the plates on a table near \\"many wagon loads\\" of other ancient records, and the Sword of Laban hanging on the cave wall.[136] According to Brigham Young's understanding, which he said that he had gained from Cowdery, on a later visit to the cave, the Sword of Laban was said to be unsheathed and placed over the plates and inscribed with the words: \\"This sword will never be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our God and his Christ.\\"[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith taught that part of the golden plates were \\"sealed.\\"[138] The \\"sealed\\" portion is said to contain \\"a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.\\"[139] Many Latter Day Saints believe that the plates will be kept hidden until a future time, when the sealed part will be translated[140] and, according to one early Mormon leader, transferred from the hill to one of the Mormon temples.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Whitmer is quoted as stating that he saw just the untranslated portion of the plates sitting on the table with the sword (and also a breastplate).[142] Apparently, Whitmer was aware of expeditions at Cumorah to locate the sealed portion of the plates through \\"science and mineral rods,\\" which, he said, \\"testify that they are there.\\"[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith said the angel Moroni had commanded him not to show the plates to any unauthorized person.[43] However, Smith eventually obtained the written statement of several witnesses who saw the plates. It is unclear whether the witnesses believed they had seen the plates with their physical eyes or had seen them in a vision. For instance, although Martin Harris continued to testify to the truth of the Book of Mormon even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he \\"seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience.\\"[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to some sources, Smith initially intended that the first authorized witness be his firstborn son;[145] but this child was stillborn in 1828.[146] In March 1829, Martin Harris came to Harmony to see the plates, but was unable to find them in the woods where Smith said they could be found.[147] The next day,[148] Smith dictated a revelation stating that Harris could eventually qualify himself[149] to be one of three witnesses with the exclusive right to \\"view [the plates] as they are\\".[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy June 1829, Smith determined that there would be eight additional witnesses, a total of twelve including Smith.[151] During the second half of June 1829,[152] Smith took Harris, Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer (known collectively as the Three Witnesses)[153] into woods in Fayette, New York, where they said they saw an angel holding the golden plates and turning the leaves.[154] The four also said they heard \\"the voice of the Lord\\" telling them that the translation of the plates was correct, and commanding them to testify of what they saw and heard.[155] A few days later, Smith took a different group of Eight Witnesses[156] to a location near Smith's parents' home in Palmyra[157] where they said Smith showed them the golden plates.[158] Statements over the names of these men, apparently drafted by Smith,[159] were published in 1830 as an appendix to the Book of Mormon.[160] According to later statements ascribed to Martin Harris, he viewed the plates in a vision and not with his \\"natural eyes.\\"[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Smith and the other eleven who claimed to be witnesses, a few other early Mormons said they saw the plates. For instance, Smith's mother Lucy Mack Smith said she had \\"seen and handled\\" the plates.[162] Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother William and younger sister Katharine also said they had examined and lifted the plates while they were wrapped in fabric.[163] Others said they had visions of the plates or had been shown the plates by an angel, in some cases years after Smith said he had returned the plates.[164]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plates were said to be bound at one edge by a set of rings. In 1828, Martin Harris, is reported to have said that the plates were \\"fastened together in the shape of a book by wires\\".[165] In 1859 Harris said that the plates \\"were seven inches [18 cm] wide by eight inches [20 cm] in length, and were of the thickness of plates of tin; and when piled one above the other, they were altogether about four inches [10 cm] thick; and they were put together on the back by three silver rings, so that they would open like a book\\".[166] David Whitmer, another of the Three Witnesses, was quoted by an 1831 Palmyra newspaper as having said the plates were \\"the thickness of tin plate; the back was secured with three small rings ... passing through each leaf in succession\\".[167] Anomalously, Smith's father is quoted as saying that the plates were only half an inch (1.27 centimeter) thick.[168] Smith's mother, who said she had \\"seen and handled\\" the plates, is quoted as saying they were \\"eight inches [20 cm] long, and six [15 cm] wide ... all connected by a ring which passes through a hole at the end of each plate\\".[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nHyrum Smith and John Whitmer, also witnesses in 1829, are reported to have stated that the rings holding the plates together were, in Hyrum's words, \\"in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book\\".[169] Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother William said they had examined the plates while wrapped in fabric. Emma said she \\"felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book\\".[125] William agreed that the plates could be rustled with one's thumb like the pages of a book.[170]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith did not provide his own published description of the plates until 1842, when he said in a letter that \\"each plate was six inches [15 cm] wide and eight inches [20 cm] long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were ... bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches [15 cm] in thickness\\".[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plates were first described as \\"gold\\", and beginning about 1827, the plates were widely called the \\"gold bible\\".[172] When the Book of Mormon was published in 1830, the Eight Witnesses described the plates as having \\"the appearance of gold\\".[173] The Book of Mormon describes the plates as being made of \\"ore\\".[174] In 1831, a Palmyra newspaper quoted David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses, as having said that the plates were a \\"whitish yellow color\\", with \\"three small rings of the same metal\\".[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith's first published description of the plates said that the plates \\"had the appearance of gold\\",[171] and Smith said that Moroni had referred to the plates as \\"gold.\\"[175] Late in life, Martin Harris stated that the rings holding the plates together were made of silver,[166] and he said the plates themselves, based on their heft of \\"forty or fifty pounds\\" (18ÿ23?kg),[176] \\"were lead or gold\\".[177] Joseph's brother William, who said he felt the plates inside a pillow case in 1827, said in 1884 that he understood the plates to be \\"a mixture of gold and copper ... much heavier than stone, and very much heavier than wood\\".[178]\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent people estimated the weight of the plates differently. According to Smith's one-time-friend Willard Chase, Smith told him in 1827 that the plates weighed between 40 and 60 pounds (18ÿ27?kg), most likely the latter.[179] Smith's father Joseph Smith, Sr., who was one of the Eight Witnesses, reportedly weighed them and said in 1830 that they \\"weighed thirty pounds\\" (14?kg).[180] Smith's brother William, who had lifted the plates, thought they \\"weighed about sixty pounds [27 kg] according to the best of my judgment\\".[181] Others who lifted the plates while they were wrapped in cloth or enclosed in a box thought that they weighed about 60 pounds [27?kg]. Martin Harris said that he had \\"hefted the plates many times, and should think they weighed forty or fifty pounds [18ÿ23 kg]\\".[182] Smith's wife Emma never estimated the weight of the plates but said they were light enough for her to \\"move them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work\\".[125] Based on some of the descriptions of the plates' dimensions, one scholar speculates that, had the plates been made of 24-karat gold (which Smith never claimed), they would have weighed about 140 pounds (64?kg),[183] while LDS writers have speculated that the plates were made of a copper-gold alloy like tumbaga, which would have weighed significantly less.[184]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Smith and others, the golden plates contained a \\"sealed\\" portion[138] containing \\"a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.\\"[185] Smith never described the nature of the seal, and the language of the Book of Mormon may be interpreted to describe a sealing that was spiritual, metaphorical,[186] physical, or a combination of these elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of Mormon refers to other documents and plates as being \\"sealed\\" to be revealed at some future time. For example, the Book of Mormon says the entire set of plates was \\"sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord\\"[187] and that separate records of John the Apostle were \\"sealed up to come forth in their purity\\" in the end times.[188] One set of plates to which the Book of Mormon refers was \\"sealed up\\" in the sense that they were written in a language that could not be read.[189]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith may have understood the sealing to be a supernatural or spiritual sealing \\"by the power of God\\" (2 Nephi 27:10),[190] an idea supported by a reference in the Book of Mormon to the \\"interpreters\\" with which Smith said they were buried or \\"sealed.\\"[191] Oliver Cowdery also stated that when Smith visited the hill, he was stricken by a supernatural force because the plates were \\"sealed by the prayer of faith.\\"[192]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral witnesses described a physical sealing placed on part of the plates by Mormon or Moroni. David Whitmer said that when an angel showed him the plates in 1829, \\"a large portion of the leaves were so securely bound together that it was impossible to separate them,\\"[193] that the \\"sealed\\" part of the plates were held together as a solid mass \\"stationary and immovable,\\"[194] \\"as solid to my view as wood,\\"[195] and that there were \\"perceptible marks where the plates appeared to be sealed\\"[196] with leaves \\"so securely bound that it was impossible to separate them.\\"[197] In 1842, Lucy Mack Smith said that some of the plates were \\"sealed together\\" while others were \\"loose.\\"[162] The account of the Eight Witnesses says they saw the plates in 1829 and handled \\"as many of the leaves as Smith has translated,\\" implying that they did not examine untranslated parts, such as the sealed portion.[173] In one interview, David Whitmer said that \\"about half\\" the book was unsealed;[198] in 1881, he said \\"about one-third\\" was unsealed.[196] Whitmer's 1881 statement is consistent with an 1856 statement by Orson Pratt, an associate of Smith's who never saw the plates himself but who had spoken with witnesses,[199] that \\"about two-thirds\\" of the plates were \\"sealed up\\".[200]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe golden plates were said to contain engravings that the Book of Mormon describes as reformed Egyptian.[201] Smith described the writing as \\"Egyptian characters ... small, and beautifully engraved,\\" exhibiting \\"much skill in the art of engraving.\\"[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses, said the plates had \\"fine engravings on both sides,\\"[202] and Orson Pratt, who did not see the plates himself but who had spoken with witnesses, understood that there were engravings on both sides of the plates, \\"stained with a black, hard stain, so as to make the letters more legible and easier to be read.\\"[203]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe golden plates are significant within the Latter Day Saint movement because they are the reputed source for the Book of Mormon, which Smith called the \\"most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion.\\"[204] However, the golden plates are just one of many known and reputed metal plates with significance in the Latter Day Saint movement. The Book of Mormon itself refers to a long tradition of writing historical records on plates, of which the golden plates are a culmination (see List of plates (Latter Day Saint movement)). In addition, Smith once believed in the authenticity of a set of engraved metal plates called the Kinderhook plates,[205] although these plates turned out to be a hoax by non-Mormons who sought to entice Smith to translate them in order to discredit his reputation.[206]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo other sets of alleged plates, the Voree plates and the Book of the Law of the Lord, were translated by James Strangone of three major contenders to succeed Smithwho went on to lead the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite).[207]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Latter Day Saints, especially those within the Community of Christ, have doubted the historicity of the golden plates and downplayed their significance.[15][208] For most Latter Day Saints, however, the physical existence and authenticity of the golden plates are essential elements of their faith. For them, the message of the Book of Mormon is inseparable from the story of its origins.[209]\\r\\n\\r\\nHugh Nibley said in 1957 that proof of the actual existence of the golden plates would not settle disputes about the Book of Mormon and the story of its origin.[210]","input":"When did joseph smith get the gold plates?"},{"output":"to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands","context":"A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the spinal cord and whose fiber (axon) projects outside the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.[1] Motor neurons' axons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors to produce effects.[2] Types of motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.\\r\\nThere are upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons, with the cell type described above being a lower motor neuron. Upper motor neurons are cortico-spinal interneurons that arise from the motor cortex and descend to the spinal cord where they activate the lower motor neurons through synapses. The term 'motor neuron' is usually restricted to the efferent nerves that actually innervate muscles (the lower motor neurons).\\r\\nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. As a result, if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed, the twitches can superimpose on one another, either through summation or a tetanic contraction. In summation, the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch. The twitches thus superimpose on one another, leading to a force greater than that of a single twitch. A tetanic contraction is caused by constant, very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come at such a rapid rate that individual twitches are indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n??????????? Development of motor function occurs well into childhood, but the development of actual motor neurons begins before we are born. About 16 days into embryonic development, gastrulation occurs and certain cells are fated to become neural cells. A few days after this the neural tube begins to develop.[4] Within this region, cells are specified to either the rostral-caudal axis or ventral-dorsal axis. Motor neuron development initiates from the ventral progenitor domain, which falls along the ventral-dorsal axis. This homeodomain is known as the motor neural progenitor domain (pMN). Transcription factors genes here include the Pax6, Olig2, Nkx6.1, and Nkx6.2 factors, which are regulated by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). The Olig2 gene being the most important due to its role in promoting Ngn2 expression, a gene that causes cell cycle exiting as well as promoting further transcription factors associated with motor neuron development.[5]\\r\\n??????????? Further specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, Wnts, and TGFb, are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors. There are 13 Hox transcription factors and- along with the signals- these determine whether a motor neuron will be more rostral or caudal in character. In the spinal column Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns.[5] ?These columns are further explained in the table below.\\r\\nUpper motor neurons are those that originate in the front lobe of the cerebral cortex. The designated area for these neurons is called the primary motor cortex and is located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up this cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. The axons of these cells descend from the cerebrum to form the corticospinal nerve tract.[8]\\r\\nWhite matter tracts are bundles of axons and serve as means to propagate nerve impulses on a large scale. These are found in the spinal cord and appear white from the myelin surrounding axons. While these tracts exist for both efferent and afferent nerves, efferent nerves will carry signals down the spinal cord toward their effector target. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. There are seven major white matter motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord and are listed below:[9]\\r\\nIt is important to note that these do not account for all the white motor tracts found in the body. An example of another tract is the anterior corticospinal tract, which originates in the cerebral cortex and terminates in the spinal cord.[9]\\r\\nLower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories.[10]\\r\\nAccording to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories[11]:\\r\\nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles [12] (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.\\r\\nIn addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. This process is also called the stretch reflex.\\r\\nThe interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found within the motor end plate. Once two acetylcholine receptors have been bound, an ion channel is opened and sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell. The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and triggers a muscle action potential. T tubules of the sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is this chemical release that causes the target muscle fiber to contract.[13]\\r\\nThese are also known as branchial motor neurons, which are involved in facial expression, mastication, phonation, and swallowing. Associated cranial nerves are the oculomotor, abducens, trochlear, and hypoglossal nerves.[11]\\r\\nThese motor neurons indirectly innervate cardiac muscle and smooth muscles of the viscera ( the muscles of the arteries): they synapse onto neurons located in ganglia of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic), located in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which themselves directly innervate visceral muscles (and also some gland cells).\\r\\nIn consequence:\\r\\nAll vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic, whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. (see Table)\\r\\nHuman lower motor neurons can be generated in vitro from embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.[16] They are currently being evaluated as experimental therapies in animal models of motor neuron disease or spinal cord injury.[17]","input":"What is the main function of motor neurons?"},{"output":"three","context":"Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed \\"the Red Devils\\", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.\\r\\nManchester United have won a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. The club has also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998ÿ99, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.[3] In 2016ÿ17, by winning the UEFA Europa League, they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions. In addition, they became the only professional English club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team that is organised by a national or international governing body.\\r\\nThe 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013,[4][5][6] when he announced his retirement. Jos Mourinho is the club's current manager, having been appointed on 27 May 2016.\\r\\nManchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2015ÿ16, with an annual revenue of ?689?million,[7] and the world's most valuable football club in 2017, valued at S2.86?billion.[8] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2?billion.[9][10] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost S800?million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[11][12] and has its strongest rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City and Leeds United.\\r\\nManchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[13] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company ÿ green and gold ÿ they were defeated 6ÿ0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[14] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892ÿ93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \\"LYR\\" from its name.[13] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[13]\\r\\nIn January 1902, with debts of S2,670 ÿ equivalent to S270,000 in 2017[nb 1] ÿ the club was served with a winding-up order.[15] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest S500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[16] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[17][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 ÿ the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[18] and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[19]\\r\\nIn 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested S2,000 and assumed control of the club.[20] In the 1938ÿ39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[20]\\r\\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[21] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[22] With an average age of 22, the back-to-back title winning side of 1956 were labelled \\"the Busby Babes\\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[23] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[24] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10ÿ0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[25]\\r\\nThe following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players?ÿ Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan?ÿ and injured several more.[26][27]\\r\\nReserve team manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958ÿ59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[28][29] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players ÿ including George Best ÿ to win the FA Cup in 1963. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4ÿ1 in the final[30] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[31] Matt Busby resigned as manager in 1969 and was replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[32]\\r\\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969ÿ70 season and a poor start to the 1970ÿ71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18?months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[34] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[30] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2ÿ1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.[32][35]\\r\\nDave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979ÿ80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[36] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years ÿ in 1983 and 1985. In 1985ÿ86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[37]\\r\\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[38] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[39] Despite a second-place finish in 1987ÿ88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[40] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3ÿ3 draw) saved Ferguson's career.[41][42] The following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1ÿ0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1ÿ0 at Wembley.[37] In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title ÿ alongside the FA Cup ÿ to complete the first \\"Double\\" in the club's history.[37]\\r\\nIn the 1998ÿ99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League ÿ \\"The Treble\\" ÿ in the same season.[44] Losing 1ÿ0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj?r scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[45] The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating Palmeiras 1ÿ0 in Tokyo.[46] Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football.[47]\\r\\nManchester United won the league again in the 1999ÿ2000 and 2000ÿ01 seasons. The team finished third in 2001ÿ02, before regaining the title in 2002ÿ03.[48] They won the 2003ÿ04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3ÿ0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[49] In the 2005ÿ06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[50] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League in the 2006ÿ07 and 2007ÿ08 seasons, and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 6ÿ5 on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[51] In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008ÿ09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[52][53] That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record S80?million.[54] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2ÿ1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[55]\\r\\nAfter finishing as runner-up to Chelsea in the 2009ÿ10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010ÿ11, securing the championship with a 1ÿ1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[56] This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012ÿ13, securing the championship with a 3ÿ0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[57]\\r\\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[58][59] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[60][61][62] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995ÿ96.[63] They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990.[64] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[65] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[66]\\r\\nAlthough Van Gaal's first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth-place finish in the Premier League, his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage.[67] United also fell behind in the title race for the third consecutive season, finishing in 5th place, in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaal's tenure. However, that same season, Manchester United won the FA Cup for a 12th time.[68] Despite this victory, Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later,[69] with Jos Mourinho appointed in his place on 27 May, signing a three-year contract.[70] That season, United finished in sixth place while winning the EFL Cup for the fifth time and the Europa League for the first time, as well as the FA Community Shield for a record 21st time. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal with United, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time top scorer, before leaving the club at the end of the season to return to Everton.\\r\\nThe club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[71] The devil stems from the club's nickname \\"The Red Devils\\"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971 (unless the team was playing in a Cup Final).[71]\\r\\nNewton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.[72] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[73] Between 1894ÿ96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys[73] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[73]\\r\\nAfter the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[73] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \\"V\\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[73] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[73] The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and/or white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. Since 1997ÿ98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.[74] The current home kit is a red Henley shirt, with black-and-white-banded cuffs and the trademark Adidas three stripes in white across the shoulders.[75]\\r\\nThe Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999ÿ2000 season,[76] and the 2011ÿ12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[77] An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995ÿ96 season was dropped after just five games, most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half-time of its final outing. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit.[78] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \\"Manchester United\\", a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[79]\\r\\nThe club's third kit is often all-blue, this was most recently the case during the 2014ÿ15 season.[80] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994ÿ95 and 1995ÿ96 seasons and once in 1996ÿ97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998ÿ99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003ÿ04 and 2005ÿ06.[81] From 2006ÿ07 to 2013ÿ14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006ÿ07 and 2010ÿ11, apart from 2008ÿ09 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967ÿ68 European Cup success.[82]\\r\\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[83] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[84] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[85] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[86]\\r\\nIn June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[87] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893ÿ94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \\"Bradford end\\". At the opposite end, the \\"Clayton end\\", the ground had been \\"built up, thousands thus being provided for\\".[87] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3ÿ2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[87] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \\"reserved side\\" (as distinct from the \\"popular side\\"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[88]\\r\\nWhen the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[89] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid S500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[90] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[90]\\r\\nHowever, following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[90] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around S60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of S30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962?spectators.[91]\\r\\nBombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of S22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \\"home\\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged S5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[92] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993ÿ94 season.[32] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing S40,000, four 180-foot (55?m) pylons were erected, each housing 54?individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[93]\\r\\nThe Taylor Report's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998ÿ99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[94] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4ÿ1, with just 114 seats (0.15?per?cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[95] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[96][97] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund.[98][99][100]\\r\\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendance in Europe.[101] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[102] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75?million fans worldwide,[11] while other estimates put this figure closer to 333?million.[103] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 71 million Facebook fans as of September 2016.[12][104] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[105]\\r\\nSupporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[106] and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford ÿ the \\"Stretford End\\" ÿ is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.[107]\\r\\nManchester United has rivalries with Arsenal, Leeds United, Liverpool, and Manchester City, against whom they contest the Manchester derby.[108][109]\\r\\nThe rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[110] Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and, at many points in their history, they have battled each other for the league title (most recently in the 2008ÿ09 season). Their matches are usually considered by the players and their fans as the biggest in any given season.\\r\\nThe \\"Roses Rivalry\\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[111]\\r\\nThe rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsne Wenger, have battled for the Premier League title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.[112][113]\\r\\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at S412?million ÿ an increase of S39?million on the previous year, valuing it at S11?million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid ÿ and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[114] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23?billion.[115] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[116] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3?billion. Forbes Magazine valued the club at $3.3?billion ÿ $1.2?billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[117] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689?billion.[118]\\r\\nThe core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[107] The \\"iconic\\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \\"catenaccio\\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \\"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\\".[119] Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[119]\\r\\nAs the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[120] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities ÿ the value of which is driven by television exposure.[121] During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.[122]\\r\\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[123] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005ÿ06, the club's commercial arm generated S51?million, compared to S42.5?million at Chelsea, S39.3?million at Liverpool, S34?million at Arsenal and S27.9?million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a S303?million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[124] Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services ÿ such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV ÿ have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[11]\\r\\nIn an initial five-year deal worth S500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982ÿ83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999ÿ2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, S30?million deal.[125] Vodafone agreed to pay S36?million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[125]\\r\\nTo commence at the start of the 2006ÿ07 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year S56.5?million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[126][127] At the beginning of the 2010ÿ11 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately S80?million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[128] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth S40?million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[129][130] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner.[131] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth S180?million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[132]\\r\\nThe club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[133] Adidas received the contract in 1980,[134] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[135] Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking S302.9?million deal that lasted until 2015; 3.8?million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[136][137] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \\"platinum\\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[138]\\r\\nOn 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014ÿ15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[139][140] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014ÿ15 season, citing rising costs.[141][142] Since the start of the 2015ÿ16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of S750?million.[143][144]\\r\\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for S1 via an application form.[16] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested S500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[16] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of S2,000.[20] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[145] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,[146] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[147]\\r\\nPromoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately S40,000, he accumulated a 54?per?cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[148] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.[149] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.[149] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for S20?million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.[149]\\r\\nManchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising S6.7?million),[150] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch ÿ now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust ÿ who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a S623?million offer,[151] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[152] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.[153]\\r\\nIn May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7?per?cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately S800?million (then approx. $1.5?billion).[154] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[155] In July 2006, the club announced a S660?million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30?per?cent reduction in annual interest payments to S62?million a year.[156][157] In January 2010, with debts of S716.5?million ($1.17?billion),[158] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth S504?million, enabling them to pay off most of the S509?million owed to international banks.[159] The annual interest payable on the bonds ÿ which mature on 1 February 2017 ÿ is approximately S45?million per annum.[160] Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre.[161][162] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \\"Red Knights\\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[163]\\r\\nIn August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1?billion (approx. S600?million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than S2?billion.[164] However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[165] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3?billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[166]\\r\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Manchester United won the most trophies in the 1990s; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup.\\r\\nThe club holds the record for most top-division titles (20) ÿ including a record 13 Premier League titles ÿ and FA Community Shields (21). It was also the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, and, as of 2017[update], is the only British club to have won the Club World Cup, in 2008. United also became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup, in 1999. The club's most recent trophy came in May 2017, with the 2016ÿ17 UEFA Europa League.\\r\\nIn winning the 2016ÿ17 UEFA Europa League, United became the fifth club in history to have won the \\"European Treble\\" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European Cup Winners' Cup/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.[210][211]\\r\\nEspecially short competitions such as the Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[212]","input":"How many times have man utd won champions league?"},{"output":"January 12, 1777","context":"Mission Santa Clara de Ass is a Spanish mission founded by the Franciscan order in the present-day city of Santa Clara, California. The mission, the eighth in California, was founded on January 12, 1777 and named for Saint Clare of Assisi, the foundress of the order of the Poor Clares. It is the namesake of both the city and county of Santa Clara, as well as Santa Clara University, which was built around the mission. This was the first California mission to be named in honor of a woman and the only one now located on a university campus.\\r\\nAlthough ruined and rebuilt six times, the settlement was never abandoned,[10] and today it functions as both a parish church of the Diocese of San Jose and a university chapel for Santa Clara University.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outpost was originally established as La Misi܇n Santa Clara de Thamien (or Mission Santa Clara de Thamien, a reference to the Tamyen people) at the Indian village of So-co-is-u-ka (meaning \\"Laurelwood\\", located on the Guadalupe River) January 12, 1777. There the Franciscan brothers erected a cross and shelter for worship to bring Christianity to the Ohlone and Costanoan peoples. Floods, fires, and earthquakes damaged many of the early structures and forced relocation to higher ground. The second site is known as Mission Santa Clara de Ass. A subsequent site of the mission dating from 1784 to 1819 is located several hundred yards west of the De La Cruz overpass of the Caltrain track; moreover, several Native American burial sites have been discovered near this subsequent site.[11] The current site, home to the first college in Alta California, dates back to 1828.[3]\\r\\nInitially, there was tension between the people of the mission and those in the nearby Pueblo de San Jose over disputed ownership rights of land and water. The tension was relieved when a road, the Alameda, was built by two hundred Indians to link the communities together.[12] On Sundays, people from San Jose would come to the mission for services, until the building of St. Joseph's Church in 1803. In that year, the mission of Santa Clara reported an Indian population of 1,271. In the same tabular report, its resident priest estimated that 10,000 cattle, 9,500 sheep, 730 horses, 35 mules, and 55 swine were on mission lands, while about 3,000 fanegas of grain (some 220 pounds each of wheat, barley or corn) had been harvested.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the Mexican secularization act of 1833 most of the mission's land and livestock was sold off by Mexico. Most of the buildings continued to be used as a parish church, unlike the other missions in California.[13]\\r\\nIn 1850, California became a state, with that change priests of the Jesuit Order took over the Mission Santa Clara de Ass in 1851 from the Franciscans. Father John Nobili, S.J., was put in charge of the mission. He began a college on the mission site in 1851, which grew into Santa Clara University;[14] it is the only mission to become part of a university, and it is also the oldest university in California. Throughout the history of the mission, the bells have rung faithfully every evening, a promise made to King Charles III of Spain when he sent the original bells to the mission in 1777. He asked that the bells be rung each evening at 8:30 in memory of those who had died.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1861, a new wooden fa?ade with two bell towers was attached over the old adobe front of the building. The interior was widened in 1885 to increase the seating capacity by removing the original adobe nave walls.[15][16] A fire in 1925 destroyed the structure, including the surrounding wall. The church's parochial functions were transferred to the Saint Clare Parish west of the campus. A rebuilt and restored Mission Santa Clara was consecrated in 1929, when it assumed its primary modern function as chapel and centerpiece of the university campus. It is open to visitors every day; the mission museum is located in the university's De Saisset Museum.\\r\\nThe original mission cemetery, still used, is located on nearby Lincoln Street.[17][18]","input":"When was the mission santa clara de asis built?"},{"output":"as early as 1951","context":"An airbag is a type of vehicle safety device and is an occupant restraint system. The airbag module is designed to inflate extremely rapidly then quickly deflate during a collision or impact with a surface or a rapid sudden deceleration. It consists of the airbag cushion, a flexible fabric bag, inflation module and impact sensor. The purpose of the airbag is to provide the occupants a soft cushioning and restraint during a crash event to prevent any impact or impact-caused injuries between the flailing occupant and the interior of the vehicle. The airbag provides an energy absorbing surface between the vehicle's occupant and a steering wheel, instrumental panel, A-B-C- structural body frame pillars, headliner and windshield/windscreen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nModern vehicles may contain multiple airbag modules in various configurations including:\\r\\nDuring a crash event, the vehicle's crash sensor(s) provide crucial information to the airbag electronic controller unit (ECU), including collision type, angle and severity of impact. Using this information, the airbag electronic controller unit's crash algorithm determines if the crash event meets the criteria for deployment and triggers various firing circuits to deploy one or more airbag modules within the vehicle. Working as a supplemental restraint system to the vehicle's seat-belt systems, airbag module deployments are triggered through a pyrotechnic process that is designed to be used once. Newer side-impact airbag modules consist of compressed air cylinders that are triggered in the event of a side on vehicle impact.[1]\\r\\nThe first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s with limited success. Broad commercial adoption of airbags occurred in many markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s with a driver airbag, and a front passenger airbag as well on some cars; and many modern vehicles now include six or more units.[2][citation needed]\\r\\nOver time, various manufacturers have used different terms for airbags. In the 1970s, General Motors marketed its first airbag modules under the unwieldy name \\"Air Cushion Restraint System (ACRS)\\". Common terms in North America refer to a nominal role as a supplement to \\"active\\" restraints, i.e. seat belts. Because no action by a vehicle occupant is required to activate or use the airbag, it is considered a \\"passive\\" device. This is in contrast to seat belts, which are considered \\"active\\" devices because the vehicle occupant must act to enable them.[3][4][5][6][7]\\r\\nThis terminology is not related to active and passive safety, which are, respectively, systems designed to prevent accidents in the first place, and systems designed to minimize the effects of accidents once they occur. In this usage, a car Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) will qualify as an active-safety device, while both its seatbelts and airbags will qualify as passive-safety devices. Further terminological confusion can arise from the fact that passive devices and systemsthose requiring no input or action by the vehicle occupantcan operate independently in an active manner; an airbag is one such device. Vehicle safety professionals are generally careful in their use of language to avoid this sort of confusion, though advertising principles sometimes prevent such semantic caution in the consumer marketing of safety features. Further confusing the terminology, the aviation safety community uses the terms \\"active\\" and \\"passive\\" in the opposite sense from the automotive industry.[8]\\r\\nIn patent applications, various airbag manufacturers sometimes use the catchall term 'inflatable occupant restraint systems' for vehicle airbags.\\r\\nThe airbag specified for automobile use traces its origins to air-filled bladders as early as 1951.[9][10]\\r\\nThe invention is credited independently to the American John W. Hetrick who in 1951 registered for the first airbag patent that was granted #2,649,311 by the United States Patent Office on 18 August 1953.[11][12] German engineer Walter Linderer who filed German patent #896,312 on 6 October 1951 was issued on 12 November 1953, approximately three months after American John Hetrick. Hetrick and Linderer's airbags were both based on a compressed air system, either released by spring, bumper contact or by the driver. Later research during the 1960s showed that compressed air could not inflate the mechanically based airbags fast enough for maximum safety, leading to the current chemical and electrically based airbags.[13][14]\\r\\nHetrick was an industrial engineer and member of the United States Navy. His airbag was designed based on his experiences with compressed air from torpedoes during his service in the Navy, combined with a desire to provide protection for his family in their automobile during accidents. Hetrick worked with the major American automobile corporations at the time, but they chose not to invest in it.[15][16] Although airbags are now required in every automobile sold in the United States, Hetrick's 1951 patent filing serves as an example of a \\"valuable\\" invention with little economic value to its inventor because its first commercial use did not occur until after the patent expired when in 1971, it was installed as an experiment in a few Ford cars.[17]\\r\\nIn Japan, Yasuzaburou Kobori (f??n) started developing an airbag \\"safety net\\" system in 1964, for which he was later awarded patents in 14 countries. He died in 1975 without seeing widespread adoption of airbag systems.[18][19][20]\\r\\nIn 1967, a breakthrough occurred in the development of airbag crash sensors, when Allen K. Breed invented a mechanically-based ball-in-tube component for crash detection, an electromechanical sensor with a steel ball attached to a tube by a magnet that would inflate an airbag in under 30 milliseconds.[21] A small explosion of sodium azide instead of compressed air was used for the first time during inflation.[14] Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation first to Chrysler. A similar \\"Auto-Ceptor\\" crash-restraint, developed by the Eaton, Yale & Towne company for Ford was soon offered as an automatic safety system in the United States,[22][23] while the Italian Eaton-Livia company offered a variant with localized[further explanation needed] air cushions.[24]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, Ford and General Motors began offering cars equipped with airbags, initially in government fleet purchased Chevrolet automobiles. GM's Oldsmobile Toronado was the first domestic vehicle to include a passenger airbag.[25][when?][citation needed] The automaker discontinued the option for its 1977 model year, citing lack of consumer interest. Ford and GM then spent years lobbying against air-bag requirements, claiming that the devices were unfeasible and inappropriate. Chrysler made a driver-side airbag standard on 1988ÿ1989 models, but it was not until the early 1990s that airbags became widespread in American cars.[26]\\r\\nAirbags for passenger cars were introduced in the United States in the mid-1970s, when seat belt usage rates in the country were quite low. Ford built an experimental fleet of cars with airbags in 1971, followed by General Motors in 1973 on Chevrolet vehicles. The early fleet of experimental GM vehicles equipped with airbags experienced seven fatalities, one of which was later suspected to have been caused by the airbag.[27]\\r\\nIn 1974, GM made its \\"Air Cushion Restraint System\\" (ACRS) available as a regular production option (RPO code AR3) in full-size Cadillacs,[28] Buick and Oldsmobile models. The GM cars from the 1970s equipped with ACRS had a driver-side airbag, a driver-side knee restraint[29] (which consists of a padded lower dashboard), and a passenger-side airbag. The passenger-side airbag protects both front passengers[29] and unlike most newer ones, it integrated a knee cushion and a torso cushion, and it also had dual stage deployment which varied depending on the force of the impact. The cars equipped with ACRS had lap belts for all seating positions but they did not have shoulder belts. Shoulder belts were already mandatory equipment in the United States on closed cars without airbags for the driver and outer front passenger seating positions, but GM chose to market its airbags as a substitute for shoulder belts. Prices for this option on Cadillac models were USD$225 in 1974, USD$300 in 1975, and USD$340 in 1976.\\r\\nThe early development of airbags coincided with an international interest in automobile safety legislation. Some safety experts advocated a performance-based occupant protection standard rather than a standard mandating a particular technical solution, which could rapidly become outdated and might not be a cost-effective approach. Nevertheless, as countries successively mandated seat belt restraints, there was less emphasis placed on other designs for several decades.[24]\\r\\nThe auto industry and research and regulatory communities have moved away from their initial view of the airbag as a seat belt replacement, and the bags are now nominally designated as Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) or Supplemental Inflatable Restraints.\\r\\nIn 1981, Mercedes-Benz introduced the airbag in West Germany as an option on its flagship saloon model, S-Class (W126). In the Mercedes system, the sensors would automatically pre-tension the seat belts to reduce occupant's motion on impact (now a common feature), and then deploy the airbag on impact. This integrated the seat belts and airbag into a restraint system, rather than the airbag being considered an alternative to the seat belt.\\r\\nIn 1987, the Porsche 944 Turbo became the first car to have driver and passenger airbags as standard equipment. The less powerful Porsche 944 and 944S had this as an available option. The same year also saw the first airbag in a Japanese car, the Honda Legend.[30]\\r\\nIn 1988, Chrysler was the first United States company to install standard driver's side air bags.[31] They came in six lines of its high volume production passenger cars.[32] The following year, Chrysler became the first United States auto manufacturer to install driver-side air bags in all its domestic-built automobiles.[33] All versions of the Chrysler minivans came with airbags starting January 1991.[31] In 1992, the Jeep Grand Cherokee became the first SUV with airbags in the market place.[34] Driver and passenger air bags became standard equipment in all Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde sedans ahead of any regulations.[35] Early 1993 saw the 4-millionth air bag-equipped Chrysler vehicle roll off the assembly line.[36] In October 1993, the Dodge Ram became the first pickup truck with airbags.[37]\\r\\nThe first known accident between two airbag-equipped automobiles took place in 1990 in Virginia, USA. A 1989 Chrysler LeBaron crossed the center line and hit another 1989 Chrysler LeBaron in a head-on collision, causing both driver airbags to deploy. The drivers suffered only minor injuries despite extensive damage to the vehicles.[38][39][40]\\r\\nThe United States Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required passenger cars and light trucks built after 1 September 1998 to have air bags for the driver and the right front passenger.[41][42] In the United States, NHTSA estimated that air bags had saved over 4,600 lives by 1 September 1999; however, the crash deployment experience of the early 1990s installations indicated that some fatalities and serious injuries were in fact caused by air bags.[41] In 1998, NHTSA initiated new rules for advanced air bags that gave automakers more flexibility in devising effective technological solutions. The revised rules also required improved protection for occupants of different sizes regardless of whether they use seat belts, while minimizing the risk to infants, children, and other occupants caused by air bags.[41]\\r\\nIn Europe, airbags were almost entirely absent from mainstream cars until the early 1990s. By 1991, four manufacturers - BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo - offered the air bag on some of their higher-end models, but shortly afterwards, airbags became a common feature on more mainstream cars.\\r\\nThe first European Ford to feature an airbag was the facelifted Escort Mark V in 1992; within a year, the entire Ford range had at least one airbag as standard. By the mid-1990s, European market leaders such as Vauxhall/Opel, Rover, PSA Peugeot Citro?n, Renault and Fiat had included airbags as at least optional equipment across their model ranges. By 1999, it was very rare to find a new mass market car without at least one airbag, and some late 1990s products, such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, also featured side airbags. The Peugeot 306 is one example of the European automotive mass-market evolution: starting in early 1993, most of these models did not even offer a driver's airbag as an option, but by 1999, even side airbags were available on several variants. On the other hand, Audi was late to offer airbag systems on a broader scale, since even in the 1994 model year its popular models did not offer airbags. Instead, the German automaker until then relied solely on its proprietary cable-based procon-ten restraint system.\\r\\nFrom around the year 2000, side-impact airbags became commonplace on even low- to mid-range vehicles, such as the smaller-engined versions of the Ford Fiesta and Peugeot 206, and curtain airbags were also becoming regular features on mass-market cars. The Toyota Avensis, launched in 2003, was the first mass-market car to be sold in Europe with nine airbags.\\r\\nVariable force deployment front airbags were developed to help minimize injury from the airbag itself.\\r\\nThe Citro?n C4 provided the first \\"shaped\\" driver airbag, made possible by this car's unusual fixed hub steering wheel.[43]\\r\\nThere are essentially two types of side airbags commonly used today: the side torso airbag and the side curtain airbag.\\r\\nMost vehicles equipped with side curtain airbags also include side torso airbags. However, some, such as the Chevrolet Cobalt,[44] 2007-09 model Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra, and 2009-12 Dodge Ram[45] do not feature the side torso airbag.\\r\\nSide-impact airbags or side torso airbags (side thorax/abdomen airbags) are a category of airbag usually located in the seat[46] or door panel,[47] and inflate between the seat occupant and the door. These airbags are designed to reduce the risk of injury to the pelvic and lower abdomen regions.[48] Most vehicles are now being equipped with different types of designs, to help reduce injury and ejection from the vehicle in rollover crashes. More recent side airbag designs[49] include a two chamber system;[50] a firmer lower chamber for the pelvic region and softer upper chamber for the ribcage.[51][52]\\r\\nThe Swedish company Autoliv AB, was granted a patent on side impact airbags, and they were first offered as an option in 1994[53] on the 1995 model year Volvo 850, and as standard equipment on all Volvo cars made after 1995.[53]\\r\\nSome cars, such as the 2010 Volkswagen Polo Mk.5 have combined head and torso side airbags. These are fitted in the backrest of the front seats, and protect the head as well as the torso.\\r\\nIn 1997, the BMW 7 Series and smaller 5 Series were fitted with a tubular shaped head side airbags (Inflatable Tubular Structure (ITS)),[54] the \\"Head Protection System (HPS)\\" as standard equipment.[55] This airbag was designed to offer head protection in side impact collisions and also maintained inflation for up to seven seconds for rollover protection. However, this tubular shaped airbag design has been quickly replaced by an inflatable 'curtain' airbag.\\r\\nIn May 1998, Toyota began offering a side curtain airbag deploying from the roof on the Progrs.[56] In 1998 the Volvo S80 was given roof-mounted curtain airbags to protect both front and rear passengers.[57] Curtain airbags were then made standard equipment on all new Volvo cars from 2000 except for the first generation C70 which received an enlarged side torso airbag that also protects the head of front seat occupants.[53] The second generation C70 convertible received the world's first door-mounted side-curtain airbags that deployed upwards.\\r\\nRoll-sensing side curtain airbags found on vehicles more prone to rollovers such as SUVs and pickups will deploy when a rollover is detected instead of just when an actual collision takes place. Often there is a switch to disable the feature in case the driver wants to take the vehicle offroad.\\r\\nCurtain airbags have been said to reduce brain injury or fatalities by up to 45% in a side impact with an SUV. These airbags come in various forms (e.g., tubular, curtain, door-mounted) depending on the needs of the application.[58] Many recent SUVs and MPVs have a long inflatable curtain airbag that protects all 3 rows of seats.\\r\\nThe second driver's side and separate knee airbag was used in the Kia Sportage (a Korean SUV launched in 1995) and has been standard equipment since then. The airbag is located beneath the steering wheel.[59][60]\\r\\nThe Toyota Caldina introduced the first Driver-side SRS knee airbag on the Japanese market in 2002.[61] Toyota Avensis became the first vehicle sold in Europe equipped with a driver's knee airbag.[62][63] The EuroNCAP reported on the 2003 Avensis, \\"There has been much effort to protect the driver's knees and legs and a knee airbag worked well.\\"[64] Since then certain models have also included front passenger knee airbags, which deploy near or over the glove compartment in a crash. Knee airbags are designed to reduce leg injury. The knee airbag has become increasingly common from 2000.\\r\\nIn 2008, the new Toyota iQ microcar featured the first production rear curtain shield airbag to protect the rear occupants' heads in the event of a rear end impact.[65]\\r\\nAnother feature of the Toyota iQ was a seat cushion airbag in the passenger seat. This is to prevent the pelvis from diving below the lap belt during a frontal impact or submarining.[66] Later Toyota models such as the Yaris added the feature to the driver's seat as well.\\r\\nIn 2009, Toyota developed the first production rear-seat center airbag designed to reduce the severity of secondary injuries to rear passengers in a side collision. This system deploys from the rear center seat first appearing in on the redesigned Crown Majesta.[67] In late 2012 General Motors with supplier Takata introduced a front center airbag, it deploys from the driver's seat.[68]\\r\\nThe 2013 GM Traverse, Acadia, and Enclave will be the first vehicles to use a center airbag for center passengers in the front row.\\r\\nThe seat belt airbag is designed to better distribute the forces experienced by a buckled person in a crash by means of increased seat belt area. This is done to reduce possible injuries to the rib cage or chest of the belt wearer.\\r\\nCessna Aircraft[75] also introduced seat belt airbags.[76] They are as of 2003[76] standard on the 172, 182, and 206.\\r\\nAirbag(s) mounted to the exterior of vehicles, so called pedestrian airbags, are designed to reduce injuries in the event of a vehicle to pedestrian collision.[77] When a collision is detected the airbag will deploy and cover hard areas, such as a-pillars[78] and bonnet edges, before they can be struck by the pedestrian.[79] When introduced in 2012 the Volvo V40 included the world's first pedestrian airbag as standard.[80] As a result, the V40 ranked highest (88%) in the EuroNCAP's pedestrian tests.[81] The 2014 Land Rover Discovery was fitted with a pedestrian airbag as well.[78][82]\\r\\nSRS airbag suppliers include Autoliv, Daicel, Takata , TRW and KSS, formerly Breed, one of the pioneers in the field.\\r\\nVarious types of airbags were tested on motorcycles by the UK Transport Research Laboratory in the mid-1970s. In 2006 Honda introduced the first production motorcycle airbag safety system on its Gold Wing motorcycle. Honda claims that sensors in the front forks can detect a severe frontal collision and decide when to deploy the airbag, absorbing some of the forward energy of the rider and reducing the velocity at which the rider may be thrown from the motorcycle.[83]\\r\\nAirbag suits have also been developed for use by Motorcycle Grand Prix riders. In their earlier form, they were connected to the motorcycle by a cable and deployed when the cable became detached from its mounting clip, inflating to protect the back of the rider. The French manufacturer Helite specializes exclusively in developing airbag jackets for motorcyclists, snowmobile riders and horseback riders.[84] Further developments were conducted by Dainese and led to an autonomous system on board the leathers, without a cable connected to the bike. Instead, an electronic system detects a fall and triggers the inflation of the nitrogen airbags to protect the rider's upper body.[85][86]\\r\\nThe airbags in the vehicle are controlled by a central Airbag control unit[87] (ACU), a specific type of ECU. The ACU monitors a number of related sensors within the vehicle, including accelerometers, impact sensors, side (door) pressure sensors,[88][89] wheel speed sensors, gyroscopes, brake pressure sensors, and seat occupancy sensors. The bag itself and its inflation mechanism is concealed within the steering wheel boss (for the driver), or the dashboard (for the front passenger), behind plastic flaps or doors which are designed to \\"tear open\\" under the force of the bag inflating. Once the requisite 'threshold' has been reached or exceeded, the airbag control unit will trigger the ignition of a gas generator propellant to rapidly inflate a fabric bag. As the vehicle occupant collides with and squeezes the bag, the gas escapes in a controlled manner through small vent holes. The airbag's volume and the size of the vents in the bag are tailored to each vehicle type, to spread out the deceleration of (and thus force experienced by) the occupant over time and over the occupant's body, compared to a seat belt alone.\\r\\nThe signals from the various sensors are fed into the Airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various additional restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and \\"curtain\\" airbags which cover the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated with one or more pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt pre-tensioner, this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly in order to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.\\r\\nOlder airbag systems contained a mixture of sodium azide (NaN3), KNO3, and SiO2. A typical driver-side airbag contains approximately 50-80 g of NaN3, with the larger passenger-side airbag containing about 250 g. Within about 40 milliseconds of impact, all these components react in three separate reactions that produce nitrogen gas. The reactions, in order, are as follows.\\r\\n(1) 2 NaN3 L 2 Na + 3 N2 (g)\\r\\n(2) 10 Na + 2 KNO3 L K2O + 5 Na2O + N2 (g)\\r\\n(3) K2O + Na2O + 2 SiO2 L K2SiO3 + Na2SiO3 (silicate glass)\\r\\nThe first reaction is the decomposition of NaN3 under high temperature conditions using an electric impulse. This impulse generates to 300?C temperatures required for the decomposition of the NaN3 which produces Na metal and N2 gas. Since Na metal is highly reactive, the KNO3 and SiO2 react and remove it, in turn producing more N2 gas. The second reaction shows just that. The reason that KNO3 is used rather than something like NaNO3 is because it is less hygroscopic. It is very important that the materials used in this reaction are not hygroscopic because absorbed moisture can de-sensitize the system and cause the reaction to fail. The final reaction is used to eliminate the K2O and Na2O produced in the previous reactions because the first-period metal oxides are highly reactive. These products react with SiO2 to produce a silicate glass which is a harmless and stable compound.\\r\\nAccording to a patent,[90] the particle size of the sodium azide, potassium nitrate, and silicon dioxide are important. The NaN3 and KNO3 must be between 10 and 20?m, while the SiO2 must be between 5 and 10?m.\\r\\nThere are ongoing efforts to find alternative compounds that can be used in airbags which have less toxic byproducts.[91] In a journal article by Akiyoshi et. Al., it was found that for the reaction of the Sr complex nitrate, (Sr(NH2NHCONHNH2)?(NO3)2 of carbohydrazide (SrCDH) with various oxidizing agents resulted in the evolution of N2 and CO2 gases. Using KBrO3 as the oxidizing agent resulted in the most vigorous reaction as well as the lowest initial temperature of reaction. The N2 and CO2 gases evolved made up 99% of all gases evolved. Nearly all the starting materials wont decompose until reaching temperatures of 500?C or higher so this could be a viable option as an air bag gas generator. In a patent containing another plausible alternative to NaN3 driven airbags, the gas generating materials involved the use of guanidine nitrate, 5-aminotetrazole, bitetrazole dehydrate, nitroimidazole, and basic copper nitrate. It was found that these non-azide reagents allowed for a less toxic, lower combustion temperature reaction and more easily disposable air bag inflation system.[citation needed]\\r\\nFront airbags normally do not protect the occupants during side, rear, or rollover accidents.[92] Since airbags deploy only once and deflate quickly after the initial impact, they will not be beneficial during a subsequent collision. Safety belts help reduce the risk of injury in many types of crashes. They help to properly position occupants to maximize the airbag's benefits and they help restrain occupants during the initial and any following collisions.\\r\\nIn vehicles equipped with a rollover sensing system, accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to sense the onset of a rollover event. If a rollover event is determined to be imminent, side-curtain airbags are deployed to help protect the occupant from contact with the side of the vehicle interior, and also to help prevent occupant ejection as the vehicle rolls over.\\r\\nAirbags are designed to deploy in frontal and near-frontal collisions more severe than a threshold defined by the regulations governing vehicle construction in whatever particular market the vehicle is intended for: United States regulations require deployment in crashes at least equivalent in deceleration to a 23?km/h (14?mph) barrier collision, or similarly, striking a parked car of similar size across the full front of each vehicle at about twice the speed.[93] International regulations are performance based, rather than technology-based, so airbag deployment threshold is a function of overall vehicle design.\\r\\nUnlike crash tests into barriers, real-world crashes typically occur at angles other than directly into the front of the vehicle, and the crash forces usually are not evenly distributed across the front of the vehicle. Consequently, the relative speed between a striking and struck vehicle required to deploy the airbag in a real-world crash can be much higher than an equivalent barrier crash. Because airbag sensors measure deceleration, vehicle speed is not a good indicator of whether an airbag should have deployed. Airbags can deploy due to the vehicle's undercarriage striking a low object protruding above the roadway due to the resulting deceleration.\\r\\nThe airbag sensor is a MEMS accelerometer, which is a small integrated circuit with integrated micro mechanical elements. The microscopic mechanical element moves in response to rapid deceleration, and this motion causes a change in capacitance, which is detected by the electronics on the chip that then sends a signal to fire the airbag. The most common MEMS accelerometer in use is the ADXL-50 by Analog Devices, but there are other MEMS manufacturers as well.\\r\\nInitial attempts using mercury switches did not work well. Before MEMS, the primary system used to deploy airbags was called a \\"rolamite\\". A rolamite is a mechanical device, consisting of a roller suspended within a tensioned band. As a result of the particular geometry and material properties used, the roller is free to translate with little friction or hysteresis. This device was developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The rolamite, and similar macro-mechanical devices were used in airbags until the mid-1990s when they were universally replaced with MEMS.\\r\\nNearly all airbags are designed to automatically deploy in the event of a vehicle fire when temperatures reach 150-200?C (300-400?F).[94] This safety feature, often termed auto-ignition, helps to ensure that such temperatures do not cause an explosion of the entire airbag module.\\r\\nToday, airbag triggering algorithms are becoming much more complex. They try to reduce unnecessary deployments and to adapt the deployment speed to the crash conditions. The algorithms are considered valuable intellectual property. Experimental algorithms may take into account such factors as the weight of the occupant, the seat location, seatbelt use, and even attempt to determine if a baby seat is present.\\r\\nWhen the frontal airbags are to deploy, a signal is sent to the inflator unit within the airbag control unit. An igniter starts a rapid chemical reaction generating primarily nitrogen gas (N2) to fill the airbag making it deploy through the module cover. Some airbag technologies use compressed nitrogen or argon gas with a pyrotechnic operated valve (\\"hybrid gas generator\\"), while other technologies use various energetic propellants. Although propellants containing the highly toxic sodium azide (NaN3) were common in early inflator designs, little to no toxic sodium azide has been found on used airbags.\\r\\nThe azide-containing pyrotechnic gas generators contain a substantial amount of the propellant. The driver-side airbag would contain a canister containing about 50 grams of sodium azide. The passenger side container holds about 200?grams of sodium azide.[95][better?source?needed]\\r\\nThe alternative propellants may incorporate, for example, a combination of nitroguanidine, phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) or other nonmetallic oxidizer, and a nitrogen-rich fuel different from azide (e.g. tetrazoles, triazoles, and their salts). The burn rate modifiers in the mixture may be an alkaline metal nitrate (NO3-) or nitrite (NO2-), dicyanamide or its salts, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), etc. The coolants and slag formers may be e.g. clay, silica, alumina, glass, etc.[96][non-primary source needed][original research?] Other alternatives are e.g. nitrocellulose based propellants (which have high gas yield but bad storage stability, and their oxygen balance requires secondary oxidation of the reaction products to avoid buildup of carbon monoxide), or high-oxygen nitrogen-free organic compounds with inorganic oxidizers (e.g., di or tricarboxylic acids with chlorates (ClO3-) or perchlorates (ClO4-) and eventually metallic oxides; the nitrogen-free formulation avoids formation of toxic nitrogen oxides).\\r\\nFrom the onset of the crash, the entire deployment and inflation process is about 0.04 seconds. Because vehicles change speed so quickly in a crash, airbags must inflate rapidly to reduce the risk of the occupant hitting the vehicle's interior.\\r\\nAdvanced airbag technologies are being developed to tailor airbag deployment to the severity of the crash, the size and posture of the vehicle occupant, belt usage, and how close that person is to the actual airbag. Many of these systems use multi-stage inflators that deploy less forcefully in stages in moderate crashes than in very severe crashes. Occupant sensing devices let the airbag control unit know if someone is occupying a seat adjacent to an airbag, the mass/weight of the person, whether a seat belt or child restraint is being used, and whether the person is forward in the seat and close to the airbag. Based on this information and crash severity information, the airbag is deployed at either at a high force level, a less forceful level, or not at all.\\r\\nAdaptive airbag systems may utilize multi-stage airbags to adjust the pressure within the airbag. The greater the pressure within the airbag, the more force the airbag will exert on the occupants as they come in contact with it. These adjustments allow the system to deploy the airbag with a moderate force for most collisions; reserving the maximum force airbag only for the severest of collisions. Additional sensors to determine the location, weight or relative size of the occupants may also be used. Information regarding the occupants and the severity of the crash are used by the airbag control unit, to determine whether airbags should be suppressed or deployed, and if so, at various output levels.\\r\\nA chemical reaction produces a burst of nitrogen to inflate the bag. Once an airbag deploys, deflation begins immediately as the gas escapes through vent(s) in the fabric (or, as it's sometimes called, the cushion) and cools. Deployment is frequently accompanied by the release of dust-like particles, and gases in the vehicle's interior (called effluent). Most of this dust consists of cornstarch, french chalk, or talcum powder, which are used to lubricate the airbag during deployment.\\r\\nNewer designs produce effluent primarily consisting of harmless talcum powder/cornstarch and nitrogen gas. In older designs using an azide-based propellant (usually NaN3), varying amounts of sodium hydroxide nearly always are initially present. In small amounts this chemical can cause minor irritation to the eyes and/or open wounds; however, with exposure to air, it quickly turns into sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). However, this transformation is not 100% complete, and invariably leaves residual amounts of hydroxide ion from NaOH. Depending on the type of airbag system, potassium chloride may also be present.\\r\\nFor most people, the only effect the dust may produce is some minor irritation of the throat and eyes. Generally, minor irritations only occur when the occupant remains in the vehicle for many minutes with the windows closed and no ventilation. However, some people with asthma may develop a potentially lethal asthmatic attack from inhaling the dust.\\r\\nBecause of the airbag exit flap design of the steering wheel boss and dashboard panel, these items are not designed to be recoverable if an airbag deploys, meaning that they have to be replaced if the vehicle has not been written off in an accident. Moreover, the dust-like particles and gases can cause irreparable cosmetic damage to the dashboard and upholstery, meaning that minor collisions which result in the deployment of airbags can be costly accidents, even if there are no injuries and there is only minor damage to the vehicle structure.\\r\\nOn 11 July 1984, the United States government amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208) to require cars produced after 1 April 1989 to be equipped with a passive restraint for the driver. An airbag or a seat belt would meet the requirements of the standard. Airbag introduction was stimulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.[97] However, airbags were not mandatory on light trucks until 1997.[98]\\r\\nIn 1998, FMVSS 208 was amended to require dual front airbags, and reduced-power, second-generation airbags were also mandated. This was due to the injuries caused by first-generation airbags, though FMVSS 208 continues to require that bags be engineered and calibrated to be able to \\"save\\" the life of an unbelted 50th-percentile size and weight \\"male\\" crash test dummy. Technical performance and validation requirements for the inflator assembly used in airbag modules are specified in SAE USCAR 24-2.[99]\\r\\nSome countries outside North America adhere to internationalized European ECE vehicle and equipment regulations rather than the United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. ECE airbags are generally smaller and inflate less forcefully than United States airbags, because the ECE specifications are based on belted crash test dummies. In the United Kingdom, and most other developed countries there is no direct legal requirement for new cars to feature airbags. Instead, the Euro NCAP vehicle safety rating encourages manufacturers to take a comprehensive approach to occupant safety; a good rating can only be achieved by combining airbags with other safety features.[100] Thus almost all new cars now come with at least two airbags as standard.\\r\\nInadvertent airbag deployment while the vehicle is being serviced can result in severe injury, and an improperly installed or defective airbag unit may not operate or perform as intended. Some countries impose restrictions on the sale, transport, handling, and service of airbags and system components. In Germany, airbags are regulated as harmful explosives; only mechanics with special training are allowed to service airbag systems.\\r\\nSome automakers (such as Mercedes-Benz) call for the replacement of undeployed airbags after a certain period of time to ensure their reliability in an accident. One example is the 1992 S500, which has an expiry date sticker attached to the door pillar. Some ?koda vehicles indicate an expiry date of 14 years from the date of manufacture. In this case, replacement would be uneconomic as the car would have negligible value at 14 years old, far less than the cost of fitting new airbags. Volvo, on the other hand, has stated \\"airbags do not require replacement during the lifetime of the vehicle,\\" though this cannot be taken as a guarantee on the device.[101]\\r\\nAlthough the millions of installed airbags in use have an excellent safety record, there are some limitations on their ability to protect car occupants.\\r\\nThe original implementation of front airbags did little to protect against side collisions, which can be more dangerous than frontal collisions because the protective crumple zone in front of the passenger compartment is completely bypassed. Side airbags and protective airbag curtains are increasingly being required in modern vehicles to protect against this very common category of collisions.\\r\\nAirbags are designed to deploy once only, and are ineffective if there are any further collisions after an initial impact. Multiple impacts may occur during certain rollover accidents or other incidents involving multiple collisions, such as many multi-vehicle collisions.[102]\\r\\nAn extremely dangerous situation occurs during \\"underride collisions\\", in which a passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a rear underride guard, or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a side underride guard.[103] The platform bed of a typical trailer is approximately at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means that there may not be much between a head and the edge of the trailer platform, except a glass windshield.[104] In an underride collision, the car's crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed, and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the windshield and roof pillars have already impacted the trailer bed.[102] Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space, leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low speed collisions. Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards, which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.[103][105]\\r\\nTypical airbag systems are completely disabled by turning off the ignition key. Unexpected turnoffs usually also disable the engine, power steering, and power brakes, and may be the direct cause of an accident. If a violent collision occurs, the disabled airbags will not deploy to protect vehicle occupants. In 2014, General Motors admitted to concealing information about fatal accidents caused by defective ignition switches which would abruptly shut down a car (including its airbags). Between 13 and 74 deaths have been directly attributed to this defect, depending on how the fatalities are classified.[106]\\r\\nUnder some rare conditions, airbags can injure and in some very rare instances kill vehicle occupants. To provide crash protection for occupants not wearing seat belts, United States airbag designs trigger much more forcefully than airbags designed to the international ECE standards used in most other countries. Recent \\"smart\\" airbag controllers can recognize if a seatbelt is used, and alter the airbag cushion deployment parameters accordingly.[107]\\r\\nIn 1990, the first automotive fatality attributed to an airbag was reported.[108] TRW produced the first gas-inflated airbag in 1994, with sensors and low-inflation-force bags becoming common soon afterwards. Dual-depth (also known as dual-stage) airbags appeared on passenger cars in 1998. By 2005, deaths related to airbags had declined, with no adult deaths and two child deaths attributed to airbags that year. However, injuries remain fairly common in accidents with an airbag deployment.\\r\\nSerious injuries are less common, but severe or fatal injuries can occur to vehicle occupants very near an airbag or in direct contact when it deploys. Such injuries may be sustained by unconscious drivers slumped over the steering wheel, unrestrained or improperly restrained occupants who slide forward in the seat during pre-crash braking, and properly belted drivers sitting very close to the steering wheel. A good reason for the driver not to cross hands over the steering wheel, a rule taught to most learner drivers but quickly forgotten by most, is that an airbag deployment while negotiating a turn may result in the driver's hand(s) being driven forcefully into his or her face, exacerbating any injuries from the airbag alone.\\r\\nImprovements in sensing and gas generator technology have allowed the development of third generation airbag systems that can adjust their deployment parameters to size, weight, position and restraint status of the occupant. These improvements have demonstrated a reduced injury risk factor for small adults and children, who had an increased risk of injury with first generation airbag systems.[109]\\r\\nOne model of airbags made by the Takata Corporation used ammonium nitrate-based gas generating compositions in airbag inflators instead of the more stable, but more expensive compound Tetrazole. The ammonium nitrate-based inflators have a flaw where old inflators with long-term exposure to hot and humid climate conditions could rupture during deployment, projecting metal shards though the airbag and into the driver.[110] The defect caused seven deaths and over 100 injuries in the U.S., and one death in Malaysia.[111] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recalled over 33 million vehicles in May 2015,[112] and fined Takata $70 million in November 2015.[113] Toyota, Mazda and Honda have said that they will not use ammonium nitrate inflators.[114][115]\\r\\nFrom 1990 to 2000, the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration identified 175 fatalities caused by air bags. Most of these (104) have been children, while the rest were adults. About 3.3 million air bag deployments have occurred during that interval, and the agency estimates more than 6,377 lives saved and countless injuries prevented.[108][116]\\r\\nA rear-facing infant restraint put in the front seat of a vehicle places an infant's head close to the airbag, which can cause severe head injuries, or death if the airbag deploys. Some modern cars include a switch to disable the front passenger airbag, in case a child-supporting seat is used there (although not in Australia, where rear-facing child seats are prohibited in the front where an airbag is fitted).\\r\\nIn vehicles with side airbags, it is dangerous for occupants to lean against the windows, doors, and pillars, or to place objects between themselves and the side of the vehicle. Articles hung from a vehicle's clothes hanger hooks can be hazardous if the vehicle's side curtain airbags deploy.[117] A seat-mounted airbag may also cause internal injury if the occupant leans against the door.[118][119]\\r\\nStarting in 2013, Japan's Takata corporation was involved in the recall of millions of airbag inflators that could inflate with too much pressure, sending shards of the metal inflator case in to the body of the driver or passenger, sometimes resulting in death.\\r\\nThe aerospace industry and the United States government have applied airbag technologies for many years. NASA, and United States Department of Defense have incorporated airbag systems in various aircraft and spacecraft applications as early as the 1960s.\\r\\nThe first use of airbags for landing were Luna 9 and Luna 13, which landed on the Moon in 1966 and returned panoramic images. As with later missions, these would use the airbags to bounce along the surface, absorbing landing energy. The Mars Pathfinder lander employed an innovative airbag landing system, supplemented with aerobraking, parachute, and solid rocket landing thrusters. This prototype successfully tested the concept, and the two Mars Exploration Rover Mission landers employed similar landing systems. The Beagle 2 Mars lander also tried to use airbags for landing, the landing was successful and the lander touched down safely, but several of the spacecraft's solar panels failed to deploy, thereby disabling the spacecraft.\\r\\nAirbags have also been used on military fixed wing aircraft, such as the Escape Crew Capsule of the F-111 Aardvark.\\r\\nThe United States Army has incorporated airbags in its UH-60A/L[120][121] Black Hawk and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior[122] helicopter fleets. The Cockpit Air Bag System (CABS)[123] consists of forward and lateral airbags, and an inflatable tubular structure (on the OH-58D only) with an Electronic Crash Sensor Unit (ECSU). The CABS system was developed by the United States Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, through a contract with Simula Safety Systems (now BAE Systems).[124] It is the first conventional airbag system for occupant injury prevention (worldwide) designed and developed and placed in service for an aircraft, and the first specifically for helicopter applications.[125][126]","input":"When was the first airbag installed in a car?"},{"output":"DJ Kool Herc","context":"","input":"Who are the founding fathers of hip hop?"},{"output":"early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova","context":"A pointe shoe is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work. Pointe shoes were conceived in response to the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe (on the tips of their toes) for extended periods of time. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, most commonly in shades of light pink.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen began to dance ballet in 1681, twenty years after King Louis XIV of France ordered the founding of the Acadmie Royale de Danse. At that time, the standard women's ballet shoe had heels. Mid-18th century dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Opra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe, enabling her to perform leaps that would have been difficult, if not impossible, in the more conventional shoes of the age. After the French Revolution, heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes. These flat-bottomed predecessors of the modern pointe shoe were secured to the feet by ribbons and incorporated pleats under the toes to enable dancers to leap, execute turns, and fully extend their feet.\\r\\nThe first dancers to rise up on their toes did so with the help of an invention by Charles Didelot in 1795. His \\"flying machine\\" lifted dancers upward, allowing them to stand on their toes before leaving the ground. This lightness and ethereal quality was well received by audiences and, as a result, choreographers began to look for ways to incorporate more pointe work into their pieces.\\r\\nAs dance progressed into the 19th century, the emphasis on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe without the aid of wires. When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe, her shoes were nothing more than modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes. Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support.\\r\\nThe next substantially different form of pointe shoe appeared in Italy in the late 19th century. Dancers like Pierina Legnani wore shoes with a sturdy, flat platform at the front end of the shoe, rather than the more sharply pointed toe of earlier models. These shoes also included a boxmade of layers of fabricfor containing the toes, and a stiffer, stronger sole. They were constructed without nails and the soles were only stiffened at the toes, making them nearly silent.\\r\\nThe birth of the modern pointe shoe is often attributed to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who was one of the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched insteps, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure on her big toes. To compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into her shoes for extra support and flattened and hardened the toe area to form a box.\\r\\nEvery dancer has unique feet, with variations that include toe length and shape, arch flexibility, and mechanical strength. Consequently, most pointe shoe manufacturers produce more than one model of shoe, with each model offering a different fit, as well as custom fitted shoes. Regardless of the manufacturer or model, however, all pointe shoes share two important structural features that enable dancers to dance on the tips of their toes:\\r\\nThe exterior of a pointe shoe is covered with fabric, thus concealing the box and other internal structural elements and lending an aesthetically pleasing look to the shoe. Most pointe shoes are covered with satin, but some are available with canvas exteriors. Pointe shoes are most often available in light pink colors and less commonly in black and white. When other colors are desired (e.g., to match a costume), pointe shoes may be dyed or, if available, ordered in custom colors.\\r\\nThe vamp refers to the shoe's upper piece, measured from the platform to the drawstring; normally, longer toes call for a longer vamp. The throat is the edge of the vamp above the arch of the foot; it is usually either v-shaped or round. The drawstring is located within the binding on the throat; this may be made from either elastic or lace.\\r\\nThe box is a rigid enclosure within the front end of the shoe that encases and supports the dancer's toes.[1] The front end of the box is flattened so as to form a platform upon which the dancer can balance, and fabric covers the exterior of the box for aesthetics.\\r\\nIn conventional pointe shoes, the box is typically made from tightly packed layers of paper and fabric that have been glued together and then shaped into an enclosure.[1] When the glue dries, it becomes hard and provides the required stiffness. In some newer pointe shoes, the box may be made from plastic and rubber, with rigidity provided by the plastic.[1]\\r\\nFor most pointe shoes, the sole is constructed from a piece of leather that is attached to the shoe with adhesive and reinforced by stitching along its edges.[1] The sole overlaps and secures the unfinished edges of the shoe's exterior fabric. Pointe shoes may be manufactured with either scraped soles, which provide superior traction, or buffed soles, which have a smoother surface for reduced traction.\\r\\nAesthetic appearance is of paramount importance for modern pointe shoes. To achieve an elegant appearance, the shoe's more decorative outer fabric is prominently featured, covering the maximum possible area of the shoe's visible surfaces. To this end, the sole is made of thin material to give it a minimal profile, and a margin of satin is artfully pleated around it so that the sole covers only part of the bottom of the shoe.\\r\\nShanks are typically made from leather, plastic, cardstock, or layers of glue-hardened burlap. The flexibility of a shank is determined by its thickness and the type of material used. A shank's thickness may be consistent throughout or it may vary along its length to produce different strengths at select points. For example, slits may be cut across a shank at demi-pointe to enhance roll through. Also, a shank's thickness may transition at some point along its length in order to implement differing strengths above and below the transition. Standard pointe shoes typically have a full shank, in which the shank runs the full length of the sole, or fractional (e.g., half or three-quarter) length shanks. Many pointe shoe manufacturers offer a choice of shank materials, and some will build shoes with customized shanks of varying stiffness and length.\\r\\nDancers will sometimes wear different pointe shoe models for different performance pieces. In such cases, the choreography often dictates the type of shank required; a lyrical style may call for a softer shoe, while an aggressive style with many turns is more easily performed in a hard, stiff shoe.\\r\\nA pointe shoe employs two fabric ribbons and an elastic band to secure it to the foot. Most of the work of securing shoes to feet is done by the ribbons. The two ribbons wrap around the dancer's ankle in opposite directions, overlapping one another so as to form a cross at the front. The ends are then tied together in a knot, which is then tucked under the ribbon on the inside of the ankle to hide it from view. The elastic bandwhich traverses the front of the ankle below the ribbonskeeps the heel of the shoe in place against the foot when the dancer is en pointe.\\r\\nThe locations where the band and ribbons attach to a shoe is critical, as incorrect placement can result in a poorly fitting shoe.[2] Optimal placement depends on the physical attributes of the foot to which it will be mated, and consequently the ribbons and elastic bands cannot be attached during the shoe manufacturing process. After acquiring a new pair of pointe shoes, a dancer must determine the appropriate attachment locations for the ribbons and elastic bands and then sew them, or arrange for them to be sewn, onto the shoes.\\r\\nA demi-pointe shoe, which is also variously called a break-down, pre-pointe, or a soft-block shoe, shares many characteristics with pointe shoes. For example, its outer appearance resembles that of a pointe shoe and it has a toe box, although the box is softer and the wings (sides of the toe box) are typically not as deep as those found on pointe shoes. Demi-pointe shoes are secured to the feet with ribbons and elastic band in identical fashion to pointe shoes. Unlike pointe shoes, however, demi-pointe shoes have no shank and, as a result, they do not provide the support necessary for proper pointe work.\\r\\nDemi-pointe shoes are most often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They serve to acclimate dancers to the feel of wearing pointe shoes and to strengthen the ankles and feet in preparation for dancing en pointe in pointe shoes. The toe box allows the dancer to experience the feel of a pointe shoe, while the insole and outsole work together to provide the resistance needed for developing foot and ankle strength.\\r\\nTraditional pointe shoes are usually manufactured using a method known as turnshoe, in which each shoe is initially assembled inside-out on a last and then turned right-side-out before finishing.[3] When manufacturing standard pointe shoes, a standardized, common last is used for both left and right shoes, resulting in identical left and right shoes in a pair. Some ballerinas have custom-made lasts that replicate the shapes of their own feet; these may be supplied to a pointe shoe manufacturer for the purpose of manufacturing custom shoes.\\r\\nDancers typically \\"break in\\" new pointe shoes to reduce or eliminate the discomfort they commonly cause, usually by performing releves and eleves that flex, and thus soften, the boxes and shanks in a natural manner. Various other methods have also been employed for breaking in pointe shoes, including deforming them with hands or against hard surfaces, striking them on hard surfaces, and moistening or heating the boxes to soften the glues, but these methods may shorten a pointe shoe's usable lifetime.\\r\\nA dancer may experience discomfort while wearing a pointe shoe even after the shoe has been broken in. Several devices are commonly used to mitigate the discomfort:\\r\\nIn the course of normal use, there are three predominant types of wear on a pointe shoe that will determine its useful lifetime. The most important of these is shank wear. As the body of the shoe is repetitively flexed, the shank gradually weakens and loses its ability to provide support. A pointe shoe is no longer serviceable when the shank breaks or becomes too soft to provide support. The second is the softening of the box and especially the platform on which the dancer balances.\\r\\nThe other primary type of wear involves the exterior fabric. In pointe work the front face and bottom edge of the toe box are subjected to friction against the performance surface. This friction will eventually wear through the shoe's outer fabric covering, thereby exposing the toe box and creating loose, frayed fabric edges. Unlike a weakened shank, damaged outer fabric does not affect the performance of a shoe. Due to its unprofessional appearance, however, damaged fabric may render the shoe unfit to wear in situations other than informal practice or rehearsal.\\r\\nUnder moderate usage, a pair of pointe shoes will typically last through ten to twenty hours of wear. For dance students, this often translates into weeks or months of serviceable use from a pair of pointe shoes. Professional dancers typically wear out pointe shoes much more quickly; a new pair may wear out in a single performance. As a result, most professional ballet companies provide shoe allowances for their dancers to defray the cost of frequent shoe replacement.\\r\\nThe lifetime of a pointe shoe depends on many factors, including:\\r\\nNew York City Ballet orders about 8,500 pairs of pointe shoes each year for 180 dancers, while the Royal Ballet dancers use about 12,000 pairs of shoes for each season.[4][5][6][7]","input":"Who invented the first pair of pointe shoes?"},{"output":"a title card designer for the London branch of the American firm Famous Players-Lasky, the production arm of Paramount Pictures, at Islington Studios","context":"","input":"How did hitchcock began his film career in 1919?"},{"output":"565 Princely States","context":"Before the Partition of India in 1947, 565 Princely States, also called Native States, existed in India,[1] which were not fully and formally part of British India, the parts of the Indian subcontinent which had not been conquered or annexed by the British but under indirect rule, subject to subsidiary alliances.\\r\\nThings moved quickly after the partition of British India in 1947. By the end of 1949, all of the states except Sikkim had chosen to accede to one of the newly independent states of India or Pakistan or else had been conquered and annexed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn principle, the princely states had internal autonomy, while by treaty the British Crown had suzerainty and was responsible for the states' external affairs. In practice, while the states were indeed ruled by potentates with a variety of titles, such as Chhatrapati, Maharaja, Raja, Raje, Deshmukh, Nawab, Baig, Khan, Nizam, Mirza, Thakore Saheb, Darbar saheb or specially Jam for Jadeja/Samma. the British had considerable influence.\\r\\nBy the time of the departure of the British in 1947, only four of the largest of the states still had their own British Resident, a diplomatic title for advisors present in the states' capitals, while most of the others were grouped together into Agencies, such as the Central India Agency, the Deccan States Agency, and the Rajputana Agency.\\r\\nFrom 1920, the states were represented in the Chamber of Princes, which held its meetings in New Delhi.\\r\\nThe most important states were ranked as salute states, whose rulers were entitled to a given number of salute guns.\\r\\nBy the Indian Independence Act 1947, the British gave up their suzerainty of the states and left each of them free to choose whether to join one of the newly independent countries of India and Pakistan or to remain outside them. For a short time, some of the rulers explored the possibility of a federation of the states separate from either, but this came to nothing. Most of the states then decided to accede to India or to Pakistan, such as Junagadh (1947ÿ1948), Hyderabad on 18 September 1948, Bilaspur on 12 October 1948, and Bhopal on 1 May 1949.

Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Andrew, Duke of York; and Edward, Earl of Wessex.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her father died in February 1952, she became Head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon. She has reigned through major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed Sri Lanka), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012 respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a Sapphire Jubilee. She is the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch as well as the world's longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state, the oldest and longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and press criticism of the royal family, in particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992 and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales. However, support for the monarchy has consistently been and remains high, as does her personal popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, the Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King. Her mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair.[2] She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[3][b] and named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after George V's mother, who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[5] Called \\"Lilibet\\" by her close family,[6] based on what she called herself at first,[7] she was cherished by her grandfather George V, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford.[9] Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.[10] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[11] The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[12] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as \\"a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.\\"[13] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as \\"a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed he would marry and have children of his own.[15] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis.[16] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of Eton College,[18] and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.[19] A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her own age.[20] Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939, Elizabeth's parents toured Canada and the United States. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.[21] Elizabeth \\"looked tearful\\" as her parents departed.[22] They corresponded regularly,[22] and she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's children were evacuated to avoid the frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham[23] that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, \\"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\\"[24] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk.[25] From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for most of the next five years.[26] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.[27] In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.[28] She stated: \\"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year.[29] As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.[30] In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873.[31] She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, \\"We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised?... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war.[35] Welsh politicians suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.[36] In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincess Elizabeth went in 1947 on her first overseas tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: \\"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and 1937.[39] They are second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. After another meeting at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth ÿ though only 13 years old ÿ said she fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters.[40] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engagement was not without controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links.[42] Marion Crawford wrote, \\"Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.\\"[43] Later biographies reported Elizabeth's mother initially opposed the union, dubbing Philip \\"The Hun\\".[44] In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was \\"an English gentleman\\".[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking the surname of his mother's British family.[46] Just before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style His Royal Highness.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world.[48] Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnell.[49] In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.[50] The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth gave birth to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.[52] A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing their wedding, the couple leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949,[48] when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardaman?a, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten. The children remained in Britain.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1951, George VI's health declined, and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she toured Canada and visited President Harry S. Truman in Washington, D.C., in October 1951, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[55] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of Kenya. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of the King and consequently Elizabeth's immediate accession to the throne. Philip broke the news to the new queen.[56] Martin Charteris asked her to choose a regnal name; she chose to remain Elizabeth, \\"of course\\".[57] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.[58] She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into Buckingham Palace.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, \\"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\\"[60] In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorc? 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, \\"the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought ÿ she hoped ÿ given time, the affair would peter out.\\"[62] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession.[63] Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.[64] In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March, the coronation on 2 June 1953 went ahead as planned, as Mary had asked before she died.[66] The ceremony in Westminster Abbey, with the exception of the anointing and communion, was televised for the first time.[67][c] Elizabeth's coronation gown was embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries:[71] English Tudor rose; Scots thistle; Welsh leek; Irish shamrock; Australian wattle; Canadian maple leaf; New Zealand silver fern; South African protea; lotus flowers for India and Ceylon; and Pakistan's wheat, cotton, and jute.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.[73] By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established.[74] In 1953, the Queen and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles by land, sea and air.[75] She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations.[76] During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her.[77] Throughout her reign, the Queen has made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she is the most widely travelled head of state.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union.[79] In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absence of a formal mechanism within the Conservative Party for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to commission to form a government. Eden recommended she consult Lord Salisbury, the Lord President of the Council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Winston Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,[82] Lord Altrincham accused her of being \\"out of touch\\".[83] Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments.[84] Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the Earl of Home as prime minister, advice she followed.[85] The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.[85] In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament, becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session.[87] Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada.[87][88] In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.[89] On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, President Kwame Nkrumah, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.[90] Harold Macmillan wrote, \\"The Queen has been absolutely determined all through?... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as?... a film star?... She has indeed 'the heart and stomach of a man'?... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen.\\"[90] Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeth's assassination.[91][92] No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; the Queen's \\"calmness and courage in the face of the violence\\" was noted.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth's pregnancies with Princes Andrew and Edward, in 1959 and 1963, mark the only times she has not performed the State Opening of the British parliament during her reign.[94] In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, declared unilateral independence from Britain while still expressing \\"loyalty and devotion\\" to Elizabeth. Although the Queen dismissed him in a formal declaration, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.[96] As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, advised the Queen to call a general election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain.[98] The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nA year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[100] As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general.[101] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband.[102] In 1978, the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceau?escu, and his wife, Elena,[103] though privately she thought they had \\"blood on their hands\\".[104] The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Paul Martin, Sr., by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried the Crown \\"had little meaning for\\" Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister.[106] Tony Benn said the Queen found Trudeau \\"rather disappointing\\".[106] Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office.[106] In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found the Queen \\"better informed?... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats\\".[106] She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state.[106] Patriation removed the role of the British parliament from the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen favoured his attempt to reform the constitution and that he was impressed by \\"the grace she displayed in public\\" and \\"the wisdom she showed in private\\".[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese. Police later discovered the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.[108] The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nMonths later, in October, the Queen was the subject of another attack while on a visit to Dunedin, New Zealand. New Zealand Security Intelligence Service documents declassified in 2018 revealed that 17-year-old Christopher John Lewis fired a shot with a .22 rifle from the fifth floor of a building overlooking the parade, but missed.[110] Lewis was arrested, but never charged with attempted murder or treason, and sentenced to three years in jail for unlawful possession and discharge of a firearm. Two years into his sentence, he attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Prince Charles, who was visiting the country with Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince William.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom April to September 1982, the Queen was anxious but proud of her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War.[112] On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard.[113] After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.[115] As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not trueso long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\"[116] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \\"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of?... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.[117] Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party ÿ Thatcher's political opponents.[118] Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \\"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\\".[119] Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen,[120] and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift ÿ membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter ÿ to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.[121] Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \\"behind the scenes force\\" in ending apartheid.[122][123]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the 1980s,  the Queen had become the target of satire.[124] The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout in 1987 was ridiculed.[125] In Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau.[122] The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, in the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, the Queen became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech on 24 November 1992, to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession, Elizabeth called 1992 her annus horribilis, meaning horrible year.[128] Republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth ÿ which were contradicted by the Palace ÿ and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[129] In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, and his wife, Sarah, separated; in April, her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips;[130] during a state visit to Germany in October, angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at her;[131] and, in November, a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny.[132] In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with \\"a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding\\".[133] Two days later, the Prime Minister, John Major, announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list.[134] In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.[135] The year ended with a lawsuit as the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated S200,000 to charity.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years to follow, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.[137] Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings.[138] Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions.[139] In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying a divorce was desirable.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons by Charles ÿ Princes William and Harry ÿ wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning.[141] After that single public appearance, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private,[142] but the royal family's seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay.[123][143] Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.[144] In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings \\"as a grandmother\\" for the two princes.[145] As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1997, the Queen and her husband held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary.[146] She made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort, referring to him as \\"my strength and stay\\".[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee. Her sister and mother died in February and March respectively, and the media speculated whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.[147] She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet \\"memorable\\" after a power cut plunged the King's House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[148] As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[149] and the enthusiasm shown by the public for the Queen was greater than many journalists had expected.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2007, The Daily Telegraph, citing unnamed sources, reported the Queen was \\"exasperated and frustrated\\" by the policies of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair.[152] She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland.[153] She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007.[154] On 20 March 2008, at the Church of Ireland St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, the Queen attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen addressed the United Nations for a second time in 2010, again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth.[156] The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, introduced her as \\"an anchor for our age\\".[157] During her visit to New York, which followed a tour of Canada, she officially opened a memorial garden for British victims of the September 11 attacks.[157] The Queen's visit to Australia in October 2011 ÿ her sixteenth visit since 1954 ÿ was called her \\"farewell tour\\" in the press because of her age.[158] By invitation of the Irish President, Mary McAleese, the Queen made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond. In a message released on Accession Day, Elizabeth wrote:\\r\\nIn this special year, as I dedicate myself anew to your service, I hope we will all be reminded of the power of togetherness and the convening strength of family, friendship and good neighbourliness?... I hope also that this Jubilee year will be a time to give thanks for the great advances that have been made since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm heart.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf.[161][162] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world.[163] In November, the Queen and her husband celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary.[164] On 18 December, she became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen, who opened the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, also opened the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London, making her the first head of state to open two Olympic Games in two countries.[166] For the London Olympics, she played herself in a short film as part of the opening ceremony, alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond.[167] On 4 April 2013, she received an honorary BAFTA for her patronage of the film industry and was called \\"the most memorable Bond girl yet\\" at the award ceremony.[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis. She returned to Buckingham Palace the following day.[169] A week later, she signed the new Commonwealth charter.[170] Because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial meeting of Commonwealth heads of government for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by her son, Prince Charles.[171] She had cataract surgery in May 2018.[172]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch on 21 December 2007, and the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015.[173][174][175] She is also the \\"longest-reigning sovereign in Canada's modern era\\".[176] (King Louis XIV of France reigned over Canada (New France) for longer than Elizabeth.[177]) She became the oldest current monarch after King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died on 23 January 2015.[178][179] She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13 October 2016,[180][181] and the oldest current head of state on the resignation of Robert Mugabe on 21 November 2017.[182][183] On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a Sapphire Jubilee,[184] and on 20 November, she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.[185] Prince Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen does not intend to abdicate,[187] though Prince Charles is expected to take on more of her duties as Elizabeth, who celebrated her 92nd birthday in 2018, carries out fewer public engagements.[188] On 20 April 2018, the government leaders of the Commonwealth of Nations announced that she will be succeeded by Prince Charles as head of the Commonwealth. The Queen stated it was her \\"sincere wish\\" that the Prince of Wales would follow her in the role.[189] Plans for her death and funeral have been extensively prepared by most British government and media organisations for decades.[190]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. As a constitutional monarch, she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum.[191] She does have a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.[192] Aside from her official religious role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, she is a member of that church and also of the national Church of Scotland.[193] She has demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis.[194] A personal note about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth. In 2000, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life. I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.[195]\\r\\nShe is patron of over 600 organisations and charities.[196] Her main leisure interests include equestrianism and dogs, especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis.[197] Her lifelong love of corgis began in 1933 with Dookie, the first corgi owned by her family.[198][199] Scenes of a relaxed, informal home life have occasionally been witnessed; she and her family, from time to time, prepare a meal together and do the washing up afterwards.[200]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous \\"fairytale Queen\\".[201] After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a \\"new Elizabethan age\\".[202] Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a \\"priggish schoolgirl\\" was an extremely rare criticism.[203] In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales.[204] In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd.[205]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic,[206] but in the 1980s, public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny.[207] Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.[208] Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.[209]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1999, a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state.[210] Polls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for Elizabeth,[211] and in 2012, her Diamond Jubilee year, approval ratings hit 90 percent.[212] Referendums in Tuvalu in 2008 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009 both rejected proposals to become republics.[213]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth has been portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists, including painters Pietro Annigoni, Peter Blake, Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy, Terence Cuneo, Lucian Freud, Rolf Harris, Damien Hirst, Juliet Pannett, and Tai-Shan Schierenberg.[214][215] Notable photographers of Elizabeth have included Cecil Beaton, Yousuf Karsh, Annie Leibovitz, Lord Lichfield, Terry O'Neill, John Swannell, and Dorothy Wilding. The first official portrait of Elizabeth was taken by Marcus Adams in 1926.[216]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth's personal fortune has been the subject of speculation for many years. In 1971 Jock Colville, her former private secretary and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth at S2?million (equivalent to about S26?million in 2016[217]).[218][219] In 1993, Buckingham Palace called estimates of S100?million \\"grossly overstated\\".[220] In 2002, she inherited an estate worth an estimated S70?million from her mother.[221] The Sunday Times Rich List 2017 estimated her personal wealth at S360?million, making her the 329th richest person in the UK.[222]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Collection, which includes thousands of historic works of art and the Crown Jewels, is not owned by the Queen personally but is held in trust,[223] as are her official residences, such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,[224] and the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio valued at S472?million in 2015.[225] Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle are personally owned by the Queen.[224] The British Crown Estate ÿ with holdings of S12?billion in 2016[222] ÿ is held in trust and cannot be sold or owned by Elizabeth in a personal capacity.[226]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.[227]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of St George.[228] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. The Queen also possesses royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.[229]","input":"When did the queen become queen of england?"},{"output":"oxidation","context":"An anode is an electrode through which the conventional current enters into a polarized electrical device. This contrasts with a cathode, an electrode through which conventional current leaves an electrical device. A common mnemonic is ACID for \\"anode current into device\\".[1] The direction of conventional current (the flow of positive charges) in a circuit is opposite to the direction of electron flow, so (negatively charged) electrons flow out the anode into the outside circuit. In a galvanic cell, the anode is the electrode at which the oxidation reaction occurs.\\r\\nAn anode is also the wire or plate having excess positive charge.[2] Consequently, anions will tend to move towards the anode.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms anode and cathode do not relate to the voltage polarity of those electrodes but the direction of the current: whether positive charge is flowing into or out of the device. Conventional current quantifies the flow of positive charge. In most cases, positive charge flows into the device via the anode, and positive charge leaves the device via the cathode.\\r\\nConventional current depends not only on the direction the charge carriers move, but also the carriers' charge. The currents outside the device are usually carried by electrons in a metal conductor. The flow of electrons is opposite to conventional current because electrons have a negative charge. Consequently, electrons leave the device via the anode, and electrons enter the device through the cathode.\\r\\nThe anode and cathode have slightly different definitions for electrical devices such as diodes and vacuum tubes where the electrode naming is fixed and does not depend on the actual charge flow (current). These devices usually allow substantial current flow in one direction but negligible current in the other direction. Consequently, the electrode names use the terms that have substantial ordinary currents. An ideal diode allows current in one direction but not in the other. The electrode that allows positive charges to flow into it would be the anode, but that electrode would never allow positive charges to flow out, so that ideal diode terminal could never be the cathode. For the ideal diode, it makes sense to always call that terminal the anode. For non-ideal diodes, the electrodes are also given fixed names even though such a diode under reverse bias would have a positive charge flow out of the \\"anode\\". For some operating conditions and devices, such as diode breakdown, Zener diodes, or photodiodes, the positive charge flow out of the \\"anode\\" could be substantial.\\r\\nThe polarity of voltage on an anode with respect to an associated cathode varies depending on the device type and on its operating mode. In the following examples, the anode is negative in a device that provides power, and positive in a device that consumes power:\\r\\nIn a discharging battery or galvanic cell (diagram at right), the anode is the negative terminal because it is where conventional current flows into \\"the device\\" (i.e. the battery cell). This inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards, negative charge flowing in one direction being electrically equivalent to positive charge flowing in the opposite direction.\\r\\nIn a recharging battery, or an electrolytic cell, the anode is the positive terminal, which receives current from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging.\\r\\nIn a diode, the anode is the positive terminal at the tail of the arrow symbol (flat side of the triangle), where current flows into the device. Note electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows \\"most easily\\"), even for types such as Zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current.\\r\\nIn a cathode ray tube, the anode is the positive terminal where electrons flow out of the device, i.e., where positive electric current flows in.\\r\\nThe word was coined in 1834 from the Greek ?Ѵ? (anodos), 'ascent', by William Whewell, who had been consulted[3] by Michael Faraday over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis. In that paper Faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the \\"decomposing body\\" (electrolyte) in a direction \\"from East to West, or, which will strengthen this help to the memory, that in which the sun appears to move\\", the anode is where the current enters the electrolyte, on the East side: \\"ano upwards, odos a way; the way which the sun rises\\".[4][5]\\r\\nThe use of 'East' to mean the 'in' direction (actually 'in' L 'East' L 'sunrise' L 'up') may appear contrived. Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term \\"eisode\\" (the doorway where the current enters). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the East electrode' (other candidates had been \\"eastode\\", \\"oriode\\" and \\"anatolode\\") was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for current, whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical magnetizing current loop around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic dipole field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the East electrode would not have been the 'way in' any more. Therefore, \\"eisode\\" would have become inappropriate, whereas \\"anode\\" meaning 'East electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the anode's function any more, but more importantly because as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the \\"anode\\" term is based is subject to reversals whereas the current direction convention on which the \\"eisode\\" term was based has no reason to change in the future.\\r\\nSince the later discovery of the electron, an easier to remember and more durably correct technically although historically false, etymology has been suggested: anode, from the Greek anodos, 'way up', 'the way (up) out of the cell (or other device) for electrons'.\\r\\nIn electrochemistry, the anode is where oxidation occurs and is the positive polarity contact in an electrolytic cell.[6] At the anode, anions (negative ions) are forced by the electrical potential to react chemically and give off electrons (oxidation) which then flow up and into the driving circuit. Mnemonics: LEO Red Cat (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation, Reduction occurs at the Cathode), or AnOx Red Cat (Anode Oxidation, Reduction Cathode), or OIL RIG (Oxidation is Loss, Reduction is Gain of electrons), or Roman Catholic and Orthodox (Reduction ÿ Cathode, anode ÿ Oxidation), or LEO the lion says GER (Losing electrons is Oxidation, Gaining electrons is Reduction).\\r\\nThis process is widely used in metals refining. For example, in copper refining, copper anodes, an intermediate product from the furnaces, are electrolysed in an appropriate solution (such as sulfuric acid) to yield high purity (99.99%) cathodes. Copper cathodes produced using this method are also described as electrolytic copper.\\r\\nIn a battery or galvanic cell, the anode is the negative electrode from which electrons flow out towards the external part of the circuit. Internally the positively charged cations are flowing away from the anode (even though it is negative and therefore would be expected to attract them, this is due to electrode potential relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal/electrolyte systems); but, external to the cell in the circuit, electrons are being pushed out through the negative contact and thus through the circuit by the voltage potential as would be expected. Note: in a galvanic cell, contrary to what occurs in an electrolytic cell, no anions flow to the anode, the internal current being entirely accounted for by the cations flowing away from it (cf drawing).\\r\\nIn the United States, many battery manufacturers regard the positive electrode as the anode, particularly in their technical literature. Though technically incorrect, it does resolve the problem of which electrode is the anode in a secondary (or rechargeable) cell. Using the traditional definition, the anode switches ends between charge and discharge cycles.\\r\\nIn electronic vacuum devices such as a cathode ray tube, the anode is the positively charged electron collector. In a tube, the anode is a charged positive plate that collects the electrons emitted by the cathode through electric attraction. It also accelerates the flow of these electrons.\\r\\nIn a semiconductor diode, the anode is the P-doped layer which initially supplies holes to the junction. In the junction region, the holes supplied by the anode combine with electrons supplied from the N-doped region, creating a depleted zone. As the P-doped layer supplies holes to the depleted region, negative dopant ions are left behind in the P-doped layer ('P' for positive charge-carrier ions). This creates a base negative charge on the anode. When a positive voltage is applied to anode of the diode from the circuit, more holes are able to be transferred to the depleted region, and this causes the diode to become conductive, allowing current to flow through the circuit. The terms anode and cathode should not be applied to a Zener diode, since it allows flow in either direction, depending on the polarity of the applied potential (i.e. voltage). \\r\\nIn cathodic protection, a metal anode that is more reactive to the corrosive environment of the system to be protected is electrically linked to the protected system, and partially corrodes or dissolves, which protects the metal of the system it is connected to. As an example, an iron or steel ship's hull may be protected by a zinc sacrificial anode, which will dissolve into the seawater and prevent the hull from being corroded. Sacrificial anodes are particularly needed for systems where a static charge is generated by the action of flowing liquids, such as pipelines and watercraft. Sacrificial anodes are also generally used in tank-type water heaters.\\r\\nIn 1824 to reduce the impact of this destructive electrolytic action on ships hulls, their fastenings and underwater equipment, the scientist-engineer Sir Humphry Davy, developed the first and still most widely used marine electrolysis protection system. Davy installed sacrificial anodes made from a more electrically reactive (less noble) metal attached to the vessel hull and electrically connected to form a cathodic protection circuit.\\r\\nA less obvious example of this type of protection is the process of galvanising iron. This process coats iron structures (such as fencing) with a coating of zinc metal. As long as the zinc remains intact, the iron is protected from the effects of corrosion. Inevitably, the zinc coating becomes breached, either by cracking or physical damage. Once this occurs, corrosive elements act as an electrolyte and the zinc/iron combination as electrodes. The resultant current ensures that the zinc coating is sacrificed but that the base iron does not corrode. Such a coating can protect an iron structure for a few decades, but once the protecting coating is consumed, the iron rapidly corrodes.\\r\\nIf, conversely, tin is used to coat steel, when a breach of the coating occurs it actually accelerates oxidation of the iron.\\r\\nThe opposite of an anode is a cathode. When the current through the device is reversed, the electrodes switch functions, so anode becomes cathode, while cathode becomes anode, as long as the reversed current is applied, with the exception of diodes where electrode naming is always based on the forward current direction.","input":"What type of chemical reaction occurs in anode?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):y("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",x]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/12.md","filePath":"qapage/12.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/12.md"},D=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
