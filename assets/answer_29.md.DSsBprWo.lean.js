The body produces insulin when glucose starts to be released into the bloodstream from the digestion of carbohydrates in the diet . Normally this insulin response triggers glucose being taken into body cells , to be used for energy , and inhibits the body from using fat for energy . The concentration of glucose in the blood decreases as a result , staying within the normal range even when a large amount of carbohydrates is consumed . When the body produces insulin under conditions of insulin resistance , the cells are resistant to the insulin and are unable to use it as effectively , leading to high blood sugar . Beta cells in the pancreas subsequently increase their production of insulin , further contributing to a high blood insulin level . This often remains undetected and can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults . Although this type of chronic insulin resistance is harmful , during acute illness it is actually a well - evolved protective mechanism . Recent investigations have revealed that insulin resistance helps to conserve the brain 's glucose supply by preventing muscles from taking up excessive glucose . In theory , insulin resistance should even be strengthened under harsh metabolic conditions such as pregnancy , during which the expanding fetal brain demands more glucose ."},{"query":"who heads up the un human rights council","short_answer":"Vojislav Šuc","abstract":""},{"query":"who were the saxons and where did they come from","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Saxons ( Latin : Saxones , German : Sachsen , Old English : Seaxe , Old Saxon : Sahson , Low German : Sassen , Dutch : Saksen ) were a Germanic people whose name was given in the early Middle Ages to a large country ( Old Saxony , Latin : Saxonia ) near the North Sea coast of what is now Germany .

Herbivore adaptations to plant defense have been likened to \`\` offensive traits '' and consist of those traits that allow for increased feeding and use of a host . Plants , on the other hand , protect their resources for use in growth and reproduction , by limiting the ability of herbivores to eat them . Relationships between herbivores and their host plants often results in reciprocal evolutionary change . When a herbivore eats a plant it selects for plants that can mount a defensive response , whether the response is incorporated biochemically or physically , or induced as a counterattack . In cases where this relationship demonstrates \`\` specificity '' ( the evolution of each trait is due to the other ) , and \`\` reciprocity '' ( both traits must evolve ) , the species are thought to have coevolved . The escape and radiation mechanisms for coevolution , presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants , has been the driving force behind speciation . The coevolution that occurs between plants and herbivores that ultimately results in the speciation of both can be further explained by the Red Queen hypothesis . This hypothesis states that competitive success and failure evolve back and forth through organizational learning . The act of an organism facing competition with another organism ultimately leads to an increase in the organism 's performance due to selection . This increase in competitive success then forces the competing organism to increase its performance through selection as well , thus creating an \`\` arms race '' between the two species . Herbivores evolve due to plant defenses because plants must increase their competitive performance first due to herbivore competitive success ."},{"query":"how long is follicular phase of menstrual cycle","short_answer":"","abstract":"The follicular phase is the phase of the estrous cycle , ( or , in humans and great apes , the menstrual cycle ) during which follicles in the ovary mature .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS .

The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

It is in this sense that one speaks of a \`\` C chord '' or a \`\` chord on C '' -- a chord built from \`\` C '' and of which the note ( or pitch ) \`\` C '' is the root . When a chord is referred to in Classical music or popular music without a reference to what type of chord it is ( either major or minor , in most cases ) , it is assumed a major triad , which for C contains the notes C , E and G . The root need not be the bass note , the lowest note of the chord : the concept of root is linked to that of the inversion of chords , which is derived from the notion of invertible counterpoint . In this concept , chords can be inverted while still retaining their root ."},{"query":"when does the full moon rise into the sky","short_answer":"","abstract":"The full moon is the lunar phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth 's perspective .

It is an allosteric enzyme made of 4 subunits and controlled by many activators and inhibitors . PFK - 1 catalyzes the important \`\` committed '' step of glycolysis , the conversion of fructose 6 - phosphate and ATP to fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP . Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration , both anaerobic and aerobic . Because phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) catalyzes the ATP - dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose - 6 - phosphate into fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP , it is one of the key regulatory and rate limiting steps of glycolysis . PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition , and in this way , the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cell 's energy requirements . For example , a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis . The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose 2 , 6 - bisphosphate . The purpose of fructose 2 , 6 - bisphosphate is to supersede ATP inhibition , thus allowing eukaryotes to have greater sensitivity to regulation by hormones like glucagon and insulin ."},{"query":"can you buy alchohol on sunday in indiana","short_answer":"","abstract":"Indiana was one of nearly a dozen U.S. states to ban all Sunday alcohol sales outside of bars and restaurants .

The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals , each to catch the previously swallowed animal . There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics , especially for the description of swallowing each animal . The spider and fly are described in each verse , but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird . The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman 's death : the logic of swallowing of even more animals of preposterous sizes without dying , contrasted with the expected , matter - of - fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself , when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd . This song for children appeals to their initial logic that a fly can be swallowed by an old lady . A spider would also be seen as logical and physically possible . As you get to the bird , it slowly becomes clear for the child that it 's part of an imaginary scenario leading to a whole horse being swallowed . The last sentence brings the child back to a rational understanding that the old lady is in fact dead of course as physically this is impossible making place for children 's amusement and laughter ."},{"query":"2018 jeep renegade engine 2.4 l 4-cylinder (limited · trailhawk)","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Jeep Renegade ( BU / 520 ) is a subcompact crossover SUV ( mini SUV in Europe ) produced by Jeep .

Splice site consensus sequences that drive exon recognition are located at the very termini of introns . The deletion of the splicing site results in one or more introns remaining in mature mRNA and may lead to the production of abnormal proteins . When a splice site mutation occurs , the mRNA transcript possesses information from these introns that normally should not be included . Introns are supposed to be removed , while the exons are expressed . The mutation must occur at the specific site at which intron splicing occurs : within non-coding sites in a gene , directly next to the location of the exon . The mutation can be an insertion , deletion , frame shift , etc . The splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences , known as splice - donor and splice - acceptor sequences , which surround each exon . Mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA , or to entire exons being spliced out of the mRNA . These changes could result in production of a nonfunctional protein . An intron is separated from its exon by means of the splice site . Acceptor - site and donor - site relating to the splice sites signal to the splicesome where the actual cut should be made . These donor sites , or recognition sites , are essential in the processing of mRNA . The average vertebrate gene consists of multiple small exons ( average size , 137 nucleotides ) separated by introns that are considerably larger ."},{"query":"who played liz's mom in spiderman homecoming","short_answer":"Garcelle Beauvais","abstract":"Spider - Man : Homecoming is a 2017 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider - Man , co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios , and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing .
