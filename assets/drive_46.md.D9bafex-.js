However, this perspective has limitations, such as requiring a causal relationship between the variables, assuming all mediators are unidirectional, and ignoring complex mediation structures."},{"question":"According to Mackinnon's (2008) perspective, what is mediation analysis?","answer":"Mediation analysis is a flexible approach to specify and test the hypothesis about the direct and indirect effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable. However, this perspective also has limitations, such as assuming the mediator variable is measured without error and ignoring the potential reciprocal relationships among the variables."},{"question":"According to Holmbeck's (1997) perspective, what is a moderator variable?","answer":"A moderator variable is a third variable that alters the direction or strength of the relationship between two other variables. Moderators can help identify the context or boundary conditions under which an effect is observed. However, this perspective also has limitations, such as requiring a specific research design and assumptions about the nature of the interaction."},{"question":"According to Hayes (2013), what is a mediated moderation analysis?","answer":"A mediated moderation analysis is a statistical approach that tests the hypothesis about the moderation of the effect of the independent variable on the mediator, which, in turn, interacts with another moderator variable to affect the dependent variable. This perspective integrates mediation and moderation concepts and has implications for hypothesis testing and research design. However, it also has limitations, such as requiring complex models and assumptions about the shape of the interaction."},{"question":"According to Judd and Kenny (2010), what is the distinction between moderated mediation and mediated moderation?","answer":"Moderated mediation refers to the situation where the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is mediated by a third variable, and this effect varies depending on the level of a moderator variable. Mediated moderation, on the other hand, refers to the situation where the effect of the mediator on the dependent variable varies depending on the level of a moderator variable. While these two concepts are often used interchangeably, they have different implications for research design and interpretations."},{"question":"According to Muller et al. (2005), what is the difference between causal mediation analysis and noncausal mediation analysis?","answer":"Causal mediation analysis is concerned with identifying the mechanisms or causal pathways through which the independent variable affects the dependent variable by intervening variables. This approach requires a specific theoretical model and causal assumptions about the relationships among variables. Noncausal mediation analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the statistical association between the variables but does not specify the causal mechanism. The distinction between these two perspectives has important implications for the interpretation of mediation analysis."},{"question":"According to Preacher et al. (2007), what is the difference between the bootstrap and the Sobel test for mediation analysis?","answer":"The bootstrap method is a simulation-based approach to estimate the sampling distribution of the indirect effect (mediator) and the confidence interval, which does not require assumptions about the normal distribution of the data. The Sobel test, on the other hand, is a parametric test that assumes the normal distribution of the data and tests the null hypothesis that the indirect effect is equal to zero. The choice of method depends on the distributional assumptions and the precision of the estimate."},{"question":"According to Kenny and Judd (2014), what is the difference between a simple moderated regression and a moderated mediation analysis?","answer":"A simple moderated regression tests the hypothesis about the interactive effect of the independent variable and the moderator on the dependent variable, without assuming any causal relationship between the variables. A moderated mediation analysis, on the other hand, tests the hypothesis about the indirect effect (mediator) of the independent variable on the dependent variable, which varies depending on the level of a moderator variable. This distinction has important implications for the interpretation of the results and the design of the study."},{"question":"According to Preacher and Hayes (2004), what is the difference between a partial mediation and a full mediation?","answer":"A partial mediation occurs when the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is partially transmitted through the mediator, but there is still a significant direct effect between the independent variable and the dependent variable. A full mediation, on the other hand, occurs when the indirect effect (mediator) accounts for all the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, and there is no significant direct effect. The distinction between partial and full mediation has implications for the interpretation of the results and the effect size."},{"question":"According to MacKinnon et al. (2007), what is the difference between the traditional approach and the modern approach to mediation analysis?","answer":"The traditional approach to mediation analysis relies on the product-of-coefficients method, that is, multiplying the coefficients of the predictor and the mediator in a regression model. This approach has limitations, such as assuming normality of the data and violating the distributional assumptions of the indirect effect. The modern approach, on the other hand, uses the distributional properties of the indirect effect to estimate the confidence interval and the significance of the effect. This approach is more robust and flexible but may require specific software and knowledge of advanced statistical methods."},{"question":"According to Kline (2011), what is the difference between a parallel mediation and a serial mediation?","answer":"A parallel mediation occurs when the independent variable affects two or more mediators simultaneously, which, in turn, influence the dependent variable. A serial mediation, on the other hand, occurs when the mediators operate in a sequence, where the effect of the first mediator on the second mediator accounts for the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. The distinction between parallel and serial mediation has implications for the interpretation of the mechanisms underlying the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable."},{"question":"According to Muller et al. (2005), what is the difference between a direct effect and an indirect effect in mediation analysis?","answer":"A direct effect refers to the association between the independent variable and the dependent variable, controlling for the mediator variable. An indirect effect, on the other hand, refers to the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, transmitted through the mediator variable. The distinction between direct and indirect effects helps to isolate the specific contribution of the mediator variable to the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable."},{"question":"According to Miller and Chapman (2001), what is the effect size of the indirect effect in mediation analysis?","answer":"The effect size of the indirect effect in mediation analysis is typically expressed as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the mediator variable. This effect size can be calculated using various methods, such as the standardized parameter estimate, the root-mean-square standard error of estimation, or the difference in R-squared values. However, due to the complexity of the relationship between the variables, the effect size may vary depending on the research context and the method used."},{"question":"According to Zhao et al. (2010), what is the difference between a mediated effect and a moderated mediation effect?","answer":"A mediated effect refers to the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, transmitted through the mediator variable, regardless of the level of the moderator variable. A moderated mediation effect, on the other hand, refers to the situation where the effect of the mediator on the dependent variable varies depending on the level of the moderator variable, indicating a conditional indirect effect. The distinction between mediated effect and moderated mediation effect has implications for the interpretation of the results and the design of the study."},{"question":"According to Shrout and Bolger (2002), what is the difference between a fixed-effects model and a random-effects model in mediation analysis?","answer":"A fixed-effects model assumes that all the variables are fixed and constant across all observations, and the sample size represents the entire population. A random-effects model, on the other hand, assumes that the variables vary across different subpopulations, and the sample size represents a random sample from the population. The choice between fixed-effects and random-effects models depends on the research design and the level of generalizability and variability of the data."},{"question":"According to MacKinnon and Dwyer (1993), what is the difference between a mediator variable and a confounding variable in mediation analysis?","answer":"A mediator variable explains the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, intervening in the causal process. A confounding variable, on the other hand, is a third variable that influences both the independent and dependent variables, leading to spurious association. The distinction between mediator and confounding variables is essential for establishing the direction and nature of the causal relationship and reducing bias."},{"question":"According to Hayes (2018), what is the difference between the conditional process model and the process model in mediation analysis?","answer":"The conditional process model is a statistical approach that tests the mediational hypotheses simultaneously for multiple values of a conditioning variable, enabling the examination of different moderators and conditional indirect effects. The process model, on the other hand, tests the hypothesis about the mediation effect between two variables, without considering the potential moderation. The choice between the conditional process model and the process model depends on the research question and the level of complexity of the mediation structure."},{"question":"According to MacKinnon et al. (2000), what is the difference between the total effect and the indirect effect in mediation analysis?","answer":"The total effect refers to the association between the independent variable and the dependent variable without considering the mediator variable. The indirect effect, on the other hand, refers to the association between the independent variable and the dependent variable through the mediator variable. The total effect can be partitioned into the direct effect (the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, controlling for the mediator variable) and the indirect effect. The distinction between total and indirect effects helps to decompose the association between the variables into specific components."},{"question":"According to Becker et al. (2018), what is the difference between a partial moderated mediation and a full moderated mediation?","answer":"A partial moderated mediation occurs when the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is partially mediated by the mediator variable, and this mediation effect varies depending on the level of the moderator variable. A full moderated mediation, on the other hand, occurs when the indirect effect (mediator) accounts for all the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, and this conditional effect varies depending on the level of the moderator variable. The distinction between partial and full moderated mediation has implications for the interpretation of the conditional indirect effect and the interaction effect."},{"question":"According to Lindell and Whitney (2001), what is the difference between a moderator and a covariate in mediation analysis?","answer":"A moderator is a variable that affects the direction and strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, depending on the level of the moderator variable. A covariate, on the other hand, is a variable that is associated with the independent or dependent variable, but not part of the causal process. The distinction between moderator and covariate variables helps to avoid the misspecification of the model and interpret the relationship between the variables accurately."},{"question":"According to Hayes and Preacher (2014), what is the difference between a mediated moderation and a moderated mediation effect?","answer":"A mediated moderation effect occurs when the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is moderated by a third variable, and this moderation effect is transmitted through the mediator variable. A moderated mediation effect, on the other hand, occurs when the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is mediated by a third variable, and this mediation effect is moderated by the moderator variable. The distinction between mediated moderation and moderated mediation has implications for the interpretation of the mechanisms and the conditional effects."},{"question":"According to Fritz and MacKinnon (2007), what is the difference between a mediator effect and a moderated mediator effect?","answer":"A mediator effect refers to the indirect effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, transmitted through the mediator variable, regardless of the level of the moderator variable.

Autism is a condition that can cause difficulties in social cognition, and a theory of mind problem could contribute to this. Autistic individuals may have difficulty understanding mental states in others because they find it challenging to understand themselves, leading to language and communication problems."},{"question":"Using the enactive approach, please describe how it explains the sensory and perceptual differences in autism?","answer":"The enactive approach to perception suggests that individuals' experiences are not solely the result of brain processing, but also from interactions with the environment. Autism is a neurological condition that can affect sensory and perceptual abilities. Therefore, this theory posits that sensory and perceptual differences could arise due to atypical ways of sensing and responding to the environment. This theory proposes that autistic individuals' sensory and perceptual differences are due to their sensory and movement differences, as they experience the world differently."},{"question":"Using the social communication model, please describe why pragmatic language deficits could arise in autism?","answer":"The social-communication model posits that differences in social communication are core to autism. Pragmatics language deficits, such as difficulties in understanding non-literal language or sarcasm, can arise in autism because autistic individuals find it challenging to read non-verbal and affective social cues. This makes comprehending nuances in language difficult, making social communication in everyday situations a struggle."},{"question":"Using the developmental theory of ADHD, please describe how it explains inattention in ADHD?","answer":"The developmental theory of ADHD suggests that inattention is because of a crucial deficit in executive functioning. Therefore, in this theory, inattentiveness in ADHD is due to an atypical delay in the development of the brain's frontal regions involved in executive functions such as attention, control, and inhibitory function. This deficit could make it challenging for individuals with ADHD to maintain focus on a task or complete a task that requires sustained attention."},{"question":"Using the neuropsychological theory, please describe how it explains the executive function deficits in ADHD?","answer":"The neuropsychological theory of ADHD posits that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition in which functional impairments present in lower-level brain regions cause deficits in higher-level cognitive processes related to attention and inhibition. ADHD researchers propose that functional impairments in areas such as the basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum cause executive function deficits in ADHD."},{"question":"Using the interactionist approach, please describe how it explains the comorbidity of anxiety in ADHD?","answer":"The interactionist approach suggests that a combination of genetic, environmental, cognitive, and behavioural variables can cause a disorder. Due to their inherent impulsivity, inattention, and emotional regulation skills, individuals with ADHD could be at an increased risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. Therefore, this approach posits that biological and environmental factors interact, leading to the development of anxiety in individuals with ADHD."},{"question":"Using the genetic theory, please describe how it explains the heritability of intellectual disabilities?","answer":"The genetic theory posits that intellectual disability can result from genetic factors alone, a combination of genetic, and environmental factors or solely through environmental factors. The heritability of intellectual disability has been estimated to be around 50%, suggesting a significant genetic component."},{"question":"Using the dynamic systems theory, please describe how it explains the variability in outcomes in intellectual disabilities?","answer":"The dynamic systems theory posits that behaviours are a result of multiple interactions between individuals and their environment. In the context of intellectual disabilities, this theory suggests that the range of outcomes is dependent on the dynamic relationship between genetic factors and environmental factors."},{"question":"Using the social model of disability, please explain how society may impact family life with a child with intellectual disabilities?","answer":"The social model of disability suggests that limitations in social, environmental, and physical access create barriers for people with disabilities. This could impact the family environment of children with intellectual disabilities through the lack of available resources to support them in the society. Further, the social stigma surrounding intellectual disability may lead to negative public attitudes towards families with children with intellectual disabilities."},{"question":"Using the enactive approach, please describe how it explains the sensory and perceptual differences in ADHD?","answer":"The enactive approach posits that sensory experiences' uniqueness is a result of an individual's interactions with the environment. ADHD can result in sensory-seeking behaviours, such as disorganisation, procrastination or impulsivity, that reflect in the way individuals perceive their environment. Individuals with ADHD can spend a lot of time in a state of sensory boredom, seeking and require novelty and action."},{"question":"Using the object relations theory, please describe how it can explain personality outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities?","answer":"The object relations theory suggests that relationships, namely those in early life with primary caregivers, regulate and shape one's internal self-representations, which influence the perception of the self and others. This theory can explain the caregiving relationship in families with a member with intellectual disabilities as observations suggest that these individuals are vulnerable to problematic interpersonal dynamics. The theory suggests that the competence of the caregiver to provide quality support can influence the individuals' personality outcomes."},{"question":"Using the ecological theory of development, please describe how it explains the impact of societal attitudes on families with children with ADHD?","answer":"The ecological theory of development posits that multiple factors can influence human development, which includes individuals, families, communities and societal attitudes. For families with children with ADHD, societal attitudes can exacerbate the experience of stigma and discrimination, which influences the family's relationship with social services, the educational system and health care providers."},{"question":"Using the developmental theory of ADHD, please describe how it explains the relationship between ADHD and aggression?","answer":"The developmental theory of ADHD suggests that deficits in executive functioning lead to impulsivity and difficulty regulating behaviour. Impaired emotional regulation and a lack of control could arise in an overreaction to minor provocations, which could lead to aggressive behaviour. The overreaction may occur due to the inability to process the situation effectively, with implications for social relationships and formal functioning."},{"question":"Using the dynamic systems theory, please describe how it explains the social factors influencing autistic individuals?","answer":"The dynamic systems theory suggests that behaviours result from the interactions between individuals and their environment. Therefore, in autism, social interaction with the individual's environment could have significant impacts on the individual's social behaviour. Social factors such as the culture, norms, values, and the opinion of others could impact the social behaviour of individuals with autism. For example, are they expected to make eye contact during conversations or whether they need to follow formal communication norms? These factors could influence the individual's social behaviour."},{"question":"Using the interactionist approach, please describe how it explains the comorbidity of depression in ADHD?","answer":"The interactionist approach suggests that a combination of genetic, environmental, cognitive, and behavioural variables can cause a disorder. ADHD symptoms such as impulsivity, inattention, and distractibility often lead to poorer academic, social and occupational outcomes. The negative experiences arising from these results can contribute to the development of anxiety and depression. Therefore, environmental factors like academic failures, stress and low self-esteem, and genetic factors may interact to facilitate resultant comorbid depression in individuals with ADHD."},{"question":"Using the cognitive-behavioral approach, please describe how it explains the anxiety in autism?","answer":"The cognitive-behavioural approach suggests that one's interpretation of the environment and thought patterns that are negative or threatening can contribute to anxiety. Autism is a condition that can lead to social issues like social anxiety, particularly if the individual finds it difficult to understand social cues. Therefore, social situations that generate anxiety may originate from the perception of a dangerous or challenging environment. Cognitive-behavioural techniques, such as cognitive restructuring, can be utilised to alleviate the anxiety issues in autism."},{"question":"Using the neuropsychological theory, please describe how it explains the attentional issues in autism?","answer":"The neuropsychological theory posits that autism is due to functional impairments in lower-level brain regions that cause deficits in higher-level cognitive processes.
