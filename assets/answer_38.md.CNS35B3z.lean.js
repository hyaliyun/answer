For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions ."},{"query":"who is interested in the magazine marie claire","short_answer":"","abstract":"Marie Claire is an international monthly magazine first published in France in 1937 , followed by the UK in 1941 .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese .

In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 ° C ( 167 ° F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) for six hours . The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia . It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it . Normal body temperature is around 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures , hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range ."},{"query":"who has the power to try the impeached president","short_answer":"the Senate","abstract":"Impeachment in the United States is an enumerated power of the legislature that allows formal charges to be brought against a civil officer of government for crimes alleged to have been committed . Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office , though there have been a few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes . The actual trial on such charges , and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction , is separate from the act of impeachment itself . Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States . Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives , and both were later acquitted by the Senate . The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed , as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment , but such a vote was widely expected to pass , and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon 's departure . To date , no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction . The impeached official continues in office until conviction ."},{"query":"who won the 11th season of american idol","short_answer":"Phillip Phillips","abstract":""},{"query":"cant take my eyes off of you andy williams","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Ca n't Take My Eyes Off You '' is a 1967 single credited to Frankie Valli .

Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"who is the president of indian cricket team","short_answer":"Rahul Johri","abstract":"The President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is the highest post at the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) , which runs Cricket in India .

The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente Cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union . France and Britain are often still referred to as \`\` historic rivals '' or with emphasis on the perceived ever - lasting competition that still opposes the two countries ."},{"query":"where was the final scene of saving private ryan","short_answer":"","abstract":"Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat .

Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism . The remaining 97 -- 99.5 % is lost by transpiration and guttation . Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata , and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage . The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells ( together known as stomatal complex ) that open and close the pore . Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures , and can be thought of as a necessary \`\` cost '' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis . Transpiration also cools plants , changes osmotic pressure of cells , and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots . Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots : the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil . Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem ."},{"query":"who told parliament to keep the tea act","short_answer":"","abstract":"Tea Act 1773 ( 13 Geo 3 c 44 ) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain .

The RH of air increases when it is cooled , since the amount of water vapor in the air ( i.e. , its specific humidity ) remains constant , while the saturation vapor pressure decreases almost exponentially with decreasing temperature . If the air parcel is lifting further beyond the LCL , water vapor in the air parcel will begin condensing , forming cloud droplets . ( In the real atmosphere , it is usually necessary for air to be slightly supersaturated , normally by around 0.5 % , before condensation occurs ; this translates into about 10 meters or so of additional lifting above the LCL . ) The LCL is a good approximation of the height of the cloud base which will be observed on days when air is lifted mechanically from the surface to the cloud base ( e.g. , due to convergence of airmasses ) ."},{"query":"what is the meaning of the greece flag","short_answer":"","abstract":"The national flag of Greece , popularly referred to as the \`\` sky - blue - white '' or the \`\` blue - white '' ( Greek : Γαλανόλευκη or Κυανόλευκη ) , officially recognised by Greece as one of its national symbols , is based on nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the façade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power princeps senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government that lasted for 300 years is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"who are the albuquerque isotopes a farm team for","short_answer":"the Colorado Rockies in the National League","abstract":"The Albuquerque Isotopes are a minor league baseball team in the southwest United States , based in Albuquerque , New Mexico .

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) . Stare decisis , the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results , lies at the heart of all common law systems ."},{"query":"when was the last time titanic was visited","short_answer":"","abstract":"The wreck of the RMS Titanic lies at a depth of about 12,500 feet ( 3,800 m ) ( 2.37 miles ( 3.81 km ) ) , about 370 miles ( 600 km ) south - southeast off the coast of Newfoundland .

Unstable isotopes decay through various radioactive decay pathways , most commonly alpha decay , beta decay , or electron capture .

Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels , particularly for electricity generation . Coal is also mined today on a large scale by open pit methods wherever the coal strata strike the surface or are relatively shallow .

Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence .

It is a measure of magnitude and phase of the output as a function of frequency , in comparison to the input . In simplest terms , if a sine wave is injected into a system at a given frequency , a linear system will respond at that same frequency with a certain magnitude and a certain phase angle relative to the input . Also for a linear system , doubling the amplitude of the input will double the amplitude of the output . In addition , if the system is time - invariant ( so LTI ) , then the frequency response also will not vary with time . Thus for LTI systems , the frequency response can be seen as applying the system 's transfer function to a purely imaginary number argument representing the frequency of the sinusoidal excitation ."},{"query":"who plays the smoking man in x files","short_answer":"William Bruce Davis","abstract":"William Bruce Davis ( born January 13 , 1938 ) is a Canadian actor and director , best known for his role as the Cigarette Smoking Man on The X-Files .
