Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars , not counting hypothetical quark stars and strange stars . Typically , neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) and a mass between 1.4 and 3 solar masses . They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star , combined with gravitational collapse , that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei . Once formed , they no longer actively generate heat , and cool over time ; however , they may still evolve further through collision or accretion . Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons ( subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons ) ; the electrons and protons present in normal matter combine to produce neutrons at the conditions in a neutron star . Neutron stars are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure , a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle , just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure . If the remnant star has a mass greater than about 3 solar masses , it continues collapsing to form a black hole ."},{"query":"where does the phrase to get cold feet come from","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what kind of wood does rudy's bbq use","short_answer":"oak","abstract":"Rudy 's Country Store and Bar - B-Q is a barbecue restaurant established in Leon Springs , a district of San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas in 1989 .

Pharyngeal slits are repeated openings that appear along the pharynx caudal to the mouth . With this position , they allow for the movement of water in the mouth and out the pharyngeal slits . It 's postulated that this is how pharyngeal slits first assisted in filter - feeding , and later with the addition of gills along their walls , aided in respiration of aquatic chordates . These repeated segments are controlled by similar developmental mechanisms . Some hemichordate species can have as many as 200 gill slits . Pharyngeal slits resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of tetrapod development . The presence of gill - like slits in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led Ernst Haeckel to postulate that \`\` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' ; this hypothesis , while false , contains elements of truth , as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in Ontogeny and Phylogeny . However , it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate pharyngeal pouches and not the neck slits that are homologous to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates . Gill slits are , at some stage of life , found in all chordates . One theory of their origin is the fusion of nephridia which opened both on the outside and the gut , creating openings between the gut and the environment ."},{"query":"pink floyd dark side of the moon play it","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when was the first 2 pound coin made","short_answer":"","abstract":"The British two pound ( £ 2 ) coin is a denomination of the pound sterling .

At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States .

This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

These programs included support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly as well as new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and changes to the monetary system . Most programs were enacted between 1933 -- 1938 , though some were later .

The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an alleged enemy of business and growth and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress from 1939 -- 1964 ."},{"query":"who disproved the idea of inheritance of acquired traits using tailless mice","short_answer":"","abstract":"August Friedrich Leopold Weismann ( 17 January 1834 -- 5 November 1914 ) was a German evolutionary biologist .

The Roman education system was based on the Greek system -- and many of the private tutors in the Roman system were Greek slaves or freedmen . The educational methodology and curriculum used in Rome was copied in its provinces , and provided a basis for education systems throughout later Western civilization . Organized education remained relatively rare , and there are few primary sources or accounts of the Roman educational process until the 2nd century AD . Due to the extensive power wielded by the paterfamilias over Roman families , the level and quality of education provided to Roman children varied drastically from family to family ; nevertheless , Roman popular morality came eventually to expect fathers to have their children educated to some extent , and a complete advanced education was expected of any Roman who wished to enter politics ."},{"query":"another word for division of a railway carriage","short_answer":"","abstract":"Rail terminology is a form of technical terminology .

In Islam , this direction is called qibla , and points towards the city of Mecca and specifically to the Ka'abah . While the compass , like any other compass , points north , the direction of prayer is indicated by marks on the perimeter of the dial , corresponding to different cities , or by a second pointer set by the user according to their own location . Al - Biruni wrote his book ( Kitab Tahdid al - Amakin , or the demarcation of the coordinates of cities ) to determine the qibla . To determine the proper direction , one has to know with some precision both the longitude and latitude of one 's own location and those of Mecca , the city toward which one must face . Once that is determined , the values are applied to a spherical triangle , and the angle from the local meridian to the required direction of Mecca can be determined . The problem admits of more than one method of solution , and Al - Biruni did his share in supplying the various methods in this book . Qibla indicators were made after al - Kindi in various forms . The indicator usually comprises a round brass box with a hinged lid and an inset magnetic compass . A list of important Islamic places with their longitudes , latitudes , is inscribed in Arabic on all sides of the box . The compass has a blued steel needle with an open circle to indicate North . It is surmounted by a brass pyramidal pivot and a glass plate covers all . A brass ring over the rim of the compass carries a degree circle numbered in ' abjad ' numerals and the cardinal points are marked . The folding triangular gnomon is supported by a decorative open - work motif . The lid of the box is secured by a hook fastener . The instrument serves the user to determine the correct ' qibla ' - the direction to which Muslims turn in prayer to face the Ka'ba in Mecca . Ornate qibla compasses date back at least to the 18th century . Some recent versions use digital readout instead of a magnetic pointer ."},{"query":"who were the latins where did they live","short_answer":"Rome","abstract":"The Latins ( Latin : Latini ) , sometimes known as the Latians , were an Italic tribe which included the early inhabitants of the city of Rome .

It requires \`\` reasonable '' governmental searches and seizures to be conducted only upon issuance of a warrant , judicially sanctioned by probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized . Under the Fourth Amendment , search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court , usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three issues : what government activities constitute \`\` search '' and \`\` seizure '' ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . Early court decisions limited the amendment 's scope to a law enforcement officer 's physical intrusion onto private property , but with Katz v.

Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell .

Lateral lines serve an important role in schooling behavior , predation , and orientation . For example , fish can use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey . Lateral lines are usually visible as faint lines of pores running lengthwise down each side , from the vicinity of the gill covers to the base of the tail . In some species , the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors , which are organs used to detect electrical impulses , and as such , these systems remain closely linked .

Mimicry may evolve between different species , or between individuals of the same species . Often , mimicry evolves to protect a species from predators , making it an antipredator adaptation . The resemblances that evolve in mimicry can be in appearance , behaviour , sound or scent . Mimicry may be to the advantage of both organisms that share a resemblance , in which case it is a mutualism , or mimicry can be to the detriment of one , making it parasitic or competitive . Mimicry occurs when a group of organisms , the mimics , evolve to share perceived characteristics with another group , the models . The evolutionary convergence between groups is driven by the selective action of a signal - receiver or dupe . Birds , for example , use sight to identify palatable insects , whilst avoiding the noxious ones . Over time , palatable insects may evolve to resemble noxious ones , making them mimics and the noxious ones models . In the case of mutualism , sometimes both groups are referred to as \`\` co-mimics '' . It is often thought that models must be more abundant than mimics , but this is not always so . Mimicry may involve numerous species ; many harmless species such as hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps , while many such well - defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings , all resembling each other . Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves three or more species ."},{"query":"who sings the theme song to one tree hill","short_answer":"Gavin DeGraw","abstract":""},{"query":"what is a large body of water that flows through land","short_answer":"River","abstract":"A body of water or waterbody ( often spelled water body ) is any significant accumulation of water , generally on a planet 's surface .

Secondary messengers are therefore one of the initiating components of intracellular signal transduction cascades . Examples of second messenger molecules include cyclic AMP , cyclic GMP , inositol trisphosphate , diacylglycerol , and calcium . The cell releases second messenger molecules in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules -- the first messengers . First messengers are extracellular factors , often hormones or neurotransmitters , such as epinephrine , growth hormone , and serotonin . Because peptide hormones and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically hydrophilic molecules , these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly -- unlike steroid hormones , which usually do . This functional limitation necessitates the cell to devise signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers , so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly . An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multi-cyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify the strength of the original first messenger signal . For example , RasGTP signals link with the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as Myc and CREB ."},{"query":"when was the last time the social security cap was raised","short_answer":"2018","abstract":"For the Old Age , Survivors and Disability Insurance ( OASDI ) tax or Social Security tax in the United States , the Social Security Wage Base ( SSWB ) is the maximum earned gross income or upper threshold on which a wage earner 's Social Security tax may be imposed .

The prefixes \`\` cis '' and \`\` trans '' are from Latin . In the context of chemistry , cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain while trans conveys that functional groups are on opposing sides of the carbon chain . Cis - trans isomers are stereoisomers , that is , pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are rotated into a different orientation in three - dimensional space . It is not to be confused with E -- Z isomerism , which is an absolute stereochemical description , and only to be used with alkenes . In general , stereoisomers contain double bonds that can not rotate , or they may contain ring structures , where the rotation of bonds is restricted or prevented . Cis and trans isomers occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes . Cis and trans descriptors are not used for cases of conformational isomerism where the two geometric forms easily interconvert , such as most open - chain single - bonded structures ; instead , the terms \`\` syn '' and \`\` anti '' would be used ."},{"query":"who made it's too late to apologize","short_answer":"OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder","abstract":"\`\` Apologize '' ( also spelled \`\` Apologise '' internationally ) is the debut single written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder for OneRepublic 's debut album Dreaming Out Loud .

Hence , a pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions ( H O ) or hydrogen ions ( H ) in the Arrhenius model . Normally , the indicator causes the color of the solution to change depending on the pH .
