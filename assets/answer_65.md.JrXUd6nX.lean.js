It is defined by the majority of mainstream economists as being an acceptable level of unemployment somewhere above 0 % . The discrepancy from 0 % arises due to non-cyclical types of unemployment , such as frictional unemployment ( there will always be people who have quit or have lost a seasonal job and are in the process of getting a new job ) and structural unemployment ( mismatch between worker skills and job requirements ) . Unemployment above 0 % is seen as necessary to control inflation in capitalist economies , to keep inflation from accelerating , i.e. , from rising from year to year . This view is based on a theory centering on the concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment ( NAIRU ) ; in the current era , the majority of mainstream economists mean NAIRU when speaking of \`\` full '' employment . The NAIRU has also been described by Milton Friedman , among others , as the \`\` natural '' rate of unemployment .

This distinguishes wine from most other consumable goods . While wine is perishable and capable of deteriorating , complex chemical reactions involving a wine 's sugars , acids and phenolic compounds ( such as tannins ) can alter the aroma , color , mouthfeel and taste of the wine in a way that may be more pleasing to the taster . The ability of a wine to age is influenced by many factors including grape variety , vintage , viticultural practices , wine region and winemaking style . The condition that the wine is kept in after bottling can also influence how well a wine ages and may require significant time and financial investment . The quality of an aged wine varies significantly bottle - by - bottle , depending on the conditions under which it was stored , and the condition of the bottle and cork , and thus it is said that rather than good old vintages , there are good old bottles . There is a significant mystique around the aging of wine , as its chemistry was not understood for a long time , and old wines are often sold for extraordinary prices . However , the vast majority of wine is not aged , and even wine that is aged is rarely aged for long ; it is estimated that 90 % of wine is meant to be consumed within a year of production , and 99 % of wine within 5 years ."},{"query":"most of the geographic expansion of the eu in the 21st century came from which nations","short_answer":"","abstract":"The European Union ( EU ) has expanded a number of times throughout its history by way of the accession of new member states to the Union .

As a general rule , this - o - almost always acts as a joint - stem to connect two consonantal roots , e.g. arthr - + - o - + logy = arthrology . But generally , the - o - is dropped when connecting to a vowel - stem ; e.g. arthr - + itis = arthritis , instead of * arthr - o-itis .

The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the Fab 's variable region . Each tip of the \`\` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the \`\` Y '' ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions .

To understand dyads it is necessary first to understand the intervals between the notes . Take the notes C and E for example ; we know that the interval between these two pitches is a major third , which can imply a C major chord ( CEG ) . The most common two - note \`\` chord '' is the interval of a perfect fifth , which has been used in nearly all discovered pieces of polyphonic music . The reason fifths are so common is because of the harmonic series . The harmonic series is built over a fundamental pitch , and the rest of the partials in the series are called overtones . The second partial is an octave above the fundamental and the third pitch is a fifth , so if C is the fundamental pitch the second note is C an octave higher and then the next pitch would be G . The harmonic series has more fifths than just this one , for example the fourth to the sixth , the sixth to the ninth and the seventh to the eleventh partial are all a fifth away from each other , though the latter is of a slightly different size than the former ones ."},{"query":"when does a confederacy of dunces take place","short_answer":"early - 1960s","abstract":"A Confederacy of Dunces is a picaresque novel by American novelist John Kennedy Toole which reached publication in 1980 , eleven years after Toole 's suicide .

The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state , and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena , including the abundance of light elements , the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , large scale structure and Hubble 's law . If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime , the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang . Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity , or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time . Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago , which is thus considered the age of the universe . After the initial expansion , the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles , and later simple atoms . Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter , eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today ."},{"query":"when did the british army first go to afghanistan","short_answer":"1839","abstract":"Afghan victory"},{"query":"who did mandy moore play in princess diaries","short_answer":"Lana Thomas","abstract":""},{"query":"who was the original host of the 1960's jeopardy tv game show","short_answer":"Art Fleming","abstract":"Arthur Fleming Fazzin ( May 1 , 1924 -- April 25 , 1995 ) , better known as Art Fleming , was an American actor and television host .

When DNA synthesis is impaired , the cell cycle can not progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis ( M ) stage . This leads to continuing cell growth without division , which presents as macrocytosis . Megaloblastic anemia has a rather slow onset , especially when compared to that of other anemias . The defect in red cell DNA synthesis is most often due to hypovitaminosis , specifically a deficiency of vitamin B and / or folic acid . Vitamin B deficiency alone will not cause the syndrome in the presence of sufficient folate , as the mechanism is loss of B dependent folate recycling , followed by folate - deficiency loss of nucleic acid synthesis ( specifically thymine ) , leading to defects in DNA synthesis . Folic acid supplementation in the absence of vitamin B prevents this type of anemia ( although other vitamin B - specific pathologies may be present ) . Loss of micronutrients may also be a cause . Copper deficiency resulting from an excess of zinc from unusually high oral consumption of zinc - containing denture - fixation creams has been found to be a cause ."},{"query":"what volcanoes from us are in the ring of fire","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Ring of Fire is a major area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur .

Its main purpose in many animals is to supply vital proteins to the cell .

The corona radiata is formed when the granulosa cells enlarge and become cuboidal , which occurs during the transition from the primordial to primary stage . These cuboidal granulosa cells , also known as the granulosa radiata , form more layers throughout the maturation process , and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the Graafian follicle .

Gradually , other territories , colonies , and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada . The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec , which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas . With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada . Later , with Confederation in 1867 , the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada , which was subsequently divided into four provinces , Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia . A number of other British colonies , such as Newfoundland and British Columbia , and large territories such as Rupert 's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation . Over time , the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949 . Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs , Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom , and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom .

In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure . When normal repair processes fail , and when cellular apoptosis does not occur , irreparable DNA damage may occur , including double - strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages ( interstrand crosslinks or ICLs ) .

In the case of electrons , the quantum numbers can be defined as \`\` the sets of numerical values which give acceptable solutions to the Schrödinger wave equation for the hydrogen atom '' .

Quantum numbers often describe specifically the energy levels of electrons in atoms , but other possibilities include angular momentum , spin , etc . An important family is flavour quantum numbers -- internal quantum numbers which determine the type of a particle and its interactions with other particles through the forces .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic ."},{"query":"is marshall islands part of the united states","short_answer":"","abstract":"Coordinates : 9 ° N 168 ° E \uFEFF / \uFEFF 9 ° N 168 ° E \uFEFF / 9 ; 168"},{"query":"how many paintings are on the sistine chapel ceiling","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who is buried at cimetiere du pere lachaise","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"which leading african american help to found the naacp","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"edward gibbon decline and fall of the roman empire pdf","short_answer":"","abstract":"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a six - volume work by the English historian Edward Gibbon . It traces Western civilization ( as well as the Islamic and Mongolian conquests ) from the height of the Roman Empire to the fall of Byzantium . Volume I was published in 1776 and went through six printings . Volumes II and III were published in 1781 ; volumes IV , V , and VI in 1788 -- 1789 . The original volumes were published in quarto sections , a common publishing practice of the time . The work covers the history , from 98 to 1590 , of the Roman Empire , the history of early Christianity and then of the Roman State Church , and the history of Europe , and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West . Because of its heavy use of primary sources , unusual at the time , its methodology became a model for later historians . This led to Gibbon 's being called the first \`\` modern historian of ancient Rome '' . His work remains a great literary achievement and a very readable introduction to the period , but considerable progress has since been made in history and archaeology , and his interpretations no longer represent current academic knowledge or thought . In The World of Late Antiquity ( 1971 ) , Peter Brown offers an alternative interpretation of the period between the second and eighth centuries AD , and Framing the Early Middle Ages ( 2005 ) by Christopher Wickham presents hitherto unavailable evidence from both documentary and archaeological sources ."},{"query":"how are we able to distinguish between high and low pitched sounds","short_answer":"","abstract":"Sound localization is a listener 's ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance .

Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history .

A number of individuals settled in the neighboring countries ( chiefly Great Britain , Germany , Austria , and Prussia ) , however quite a few also went to the United States . The displacement of these Frenchmen led to a spread of French culture , policies regulating immigration , and a safe haven for Royalists and other counterrevolutionaries to outlast the violence of the French Revolution . The long - term impact on France was profound , shaping politics , society , religion and ideas , and polarizing politics for more than a century .

On a macroscopic scale ( one where the dimensions investigated are much , much larger than the wavelength of the photons in question ) , the photons can be said to follow Snell 's Law .

In other words , a translucent medium allows the transport of light while a transparent medium not only allows the transport of light but allows for image formation . The opposite property of translucency is opacity .

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive ."},{"query":"who played lord humungus in the road warrior","short_answer":"Kjell Nilsson","abstract":"Kjell Nilsson ( born December 19 , 1949 ) is a Swedish olympic - class weight lifter and actor .
