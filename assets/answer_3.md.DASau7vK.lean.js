The term Scotch - Irish is used primarily in the United States , with people in Great Britain or Ireland who are of a similar ancestry identifying as Ulster Scots people . Most of these emigres from Ireland had been recent settlers , or the descendants of settlers , from the Kingdom of England or the Kingdom of Scotland who had gone to Ireland to seek economic opportunities and freedom from the control of the episcopal Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church . These included 200,000 Scottish Presbyterians who settled in Ireland between 1608 - 1697 . Many English - born settlers of this period were also Presbyterians , although the denomination is today most strongly identified with Scotland . When King Charles I attempted to force these Presbyterians into the Church of England in the 1630s , many chose to re-emigrate to North America where religious liberty was greater . Later attempts to force the Church of England 's control over dissident Protestants in Ireland were to lead to further waves of emigration to the trans - Atlantic colonies ."},{"query":"when is the new magic the gathering set coming out","short_answer":"October 5 , 2018","abstract":"The trading card game Magic : The Gathering has released a large number of sets since it was first published by Wizards of the Coast .

The exosphere is above that but is a minor layer of the atmosphere . Within this layer of the atmosphere , ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization / photodissociation of molecules , creating ions in the ionosphere . The radiative properties of UV rays cause an imbalance of positive and negative energy , creating ions . Taking its name from the Greek θερμός ( pronounced thermos ) meaning heat , the thermosphere begins about 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) above the Earth . At these high altitudes , the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass ( see turbosphere ) . Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation . Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity , and can rise to 2,000 ° C ( 3,630 ° F ) . Radiation causes the atmosphere particles in this layer to become electrically charged ( see ionosphere ) , enabling radio waves to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon . In the exosphere , beginning at 500 to 1,000 kilometres ( 310 to 620 mi ) above the Earth 's surface , the atmosphere turns into space , although by the criteria set for the definition of the Kármán line , the thermosphere itself is part of space ."},{"query":"lagu aerosmith i don't want to miss a thing","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` I Do n't Want to Miss a Thing '' is a power ballad performed by American hard rock band Aerosmith for the 1998 film Armageddon which Steven Tyler 's daughter Liv Tyler starred in .

The changes elicited by ligand binding ( or signal sensing ) in a receptor give rise to a signaling cascade , which is a chain of biochemical events along a signaling pathway . When signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks , which allow cellular responses to be coordinated , often by combinatorial signaling events . At the molecular level , such responses include changes in the transcription or translation of genes , and post-translational and conformational changes in proteins , as well as changes in their location . These molecular events are the basic mechanisms controlling cell growth , proliferation , metabolism and many other processes . In multicellular organisms , signal transduction pathways have evolved to regulate cell communication in a wide variety of ways ."},{"query":"once upon a time season 7 hansel actor","short_answer":"Nathan Parsons","abstract":""},{"query":"thou shalt honor thy mother and thy father","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Honour thy father and thy mother '' is one of the Ten Commandments in the Hebrew Bible .

The word \`\` autobiography '' was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical The Monthly Review , when he suggested the word as a hybrid , but condemned it as \`\` pedantic '' . However , its next recorded use was in its present sense , by Robert Southey in 1809 . Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century , first - person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity . Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self - reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that \`\` ( autobiography ) is a review of a life from a particular moment in time , while the diary , however reflective it may be , moves through a series of moments in time '' . Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer 's life from the moment of composition . While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints , autobiography may be based entirely on the writer 's memory . The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends , as Pascal claims , to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer 's review of his or her life ."},{"query":"where is france located on a world map","short_answer":"western Europe","abstract":"-- in Europe ( green & dark grey ) -- in the European Union ( green )"},{"query":"what is the most watched simpsons episode ever","short_answer":"Bart Gets an \`\` F ''","abstract":""},{"query":"sex and the city season 1 episode guide","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following is a list of episodes from the American television series Sex and the City ."},{"query":"how many military bases does the us have in europe","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of military installations owned or used by the United States Armed Forces currently located in the United States and around the world .

The Wolff rearrangement yields a ketene as an intermediate product , which can undergo nucleophilic attack with weakly acidic nucleophiles such as water , alcohols , and amines , to generate carboxylic acid derivatives or undergo ( 2 + 2 ) cycloaddition reactions to form four - membered rings .

The microstructure of a material ( such as metals , polymers , ceramics or composites ) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength , toughness , ductility , hardness , corrosion resistance , high / low temperature behavior or wear resistance . These properties in turn govern the application of these materials in industrial practice . Microstructure at scales smaller than can be viewed with optical microscopes is often called nanostructure , while the structure in which individual atoms are arranged is known as crystal structure . The nanostructure of biological specimens is referred to as ultrastructure . A microstructure 's influence on the mechanical and physical properties of a material is primarily governed by the different defects present or absent of the structure . These defects can take many forms but the primary ones are the pores . Even if those pores play a very important role in the definition of the characteristics of a material , so does its composition . In fact , for many materials , different phases can exist at the same time . These phases have different properties and if managed correctly , can prevent the fracture of the material ."},{"query":"a planet that is not within a habitable zone cannot have","short_answer":"","abstract":"Core concepts"},{"query":"where did chinua achebe get the title things fall apart","short_answer":"from W.B.

In the scope of DLS , temporal fluctuations are usually analyzed by means of the intensity or photon auto - correlation function ( also known as photon correlation spectroscopy or quasi-elastic light scattering ) . In the time domain analysis , the autocorrelation function ( ACF ) usually decays starting from zero delay time , and faster dynamics due to smaller particles lead to faster decorrelation of scattered intensity trace .

Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium , the gel , where an electric field induces the nucleic acids ( which are negatively charged due to their sugar - phosphate backbone ) to migrate toward the anode ( which is positively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell ) . The separation of these fragments is accomplished by exploiting the mobilities with which different sized molecules are able to pass through the gel . Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel . Because the size of the molecule affects its mobility , smaller fragments end up nearer to the anode than longer ones in a given period . After some time , the voltage is removed and the fragmentation gradient is analyzed . For larger separations between similar sized fragments , either the voltage or run time can be increased . Extended runs across a low voltage gel yield the most accurate resolution . Voltage is , however , not the sole factor in determining electrophoresis of nucleic acids ."},{"query":"during the 1920 what was the goal of the united states tariffs","short_answer":"to ease the plight of farmers until a better solution could be put into place","abstract":"The Emergency Tariff of 1921 of the United States was enacted on May 27 , 1921 .

This curved path was shown by Galileo to be a parabola . The study of such motions is called ballistics , and such a trajectory is a ballistic trajectory . The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity , which acts downward , thus imparting to the object a downward acceleration . Because of the object 's inertia , no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity component of the object . Taking other forces into account , such as friction from aerodynamic drag or internal propulsion such as in a rocket , requires additional analysis . A ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight , and whose subsequent course is governed by the laws of classical mechanics ."},{"query":"which links all the atm's in india","short_answer":"National Financial Switch ( NFS )","abstract":""},{"query":"where is the universal declaration of human rights kept","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) is a historic document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its third session on 10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris , France .

While an estimated 36 million Americans ( 12 % of the total population ) reported Irish ancestry in 2006 , and 6 million ( 2 % of the population ) reported Scottish ancestry , an additional 5.4 million ( 1.8 % of the population ) identified more specifically with Scotch - Irish ancestry . The term Scotch - Irish is used primarily in the United States , with people in Great Britain or Ireland who are of a similar ancestry identifying as Ulster Scots people . Most of these emigres from Ireland had been recent settlers , or the descendants of settlers , from the Kingdom of England or the Kingdom of Scotland who had gone to the Kingdom of Ireland to seek economic opportunities and freedom from the control of the episcopal Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church . These included 200,000 Scottish Presbyterians who settled in Ireland between 1608 - 1697 . Many English - born settlers of this period were also Presbyterians , although the denomination is today most strongly identified with Scotland . When King Charles I attempted to force these Presbyterians into the Church of England in the 1630s , many chose to re-emigrate to North America where religious liberty was greater . Later attempts to force the Church of England 's control over dissident Protestants in Ireland were to lead to further waves of emigration to the trans - Atlantic colonies ."},{"query":"can you flip a coin on its side","short_answer":"","abstract":"Coin flipping , coin tossing , or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands to choose between two alternatives , sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties .

This is accomplished by blocking the binding site of the substrate - the active site - by some means . The V indicates the maximum velocity of the reaction , while the K is the amount of substrate needed to reach half of the V. K also plays a part in indicating the tendency of the substrate to bind the enzyme . Competitive inhibition can be overcome by adding more substrate to the reaction ; therefore , increasing the chances of the enzyme and substrate binding . As a result , this alters only the K , leaving the V the same . This can be demonstrated using enzyme kinetics plots such as the Michaelis - Menten or the Lineweaver - Burk plot . Once the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme , the slope will be affected , as the K either increases or decreases from the original K of the reaction ."},{"query":"who is the actor who plays the bfg","short_answer":"Mark Rylance","abstract":"The BFG is a 2016 American fantasy adventure film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg , written by Melissa Mathison and based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl .

This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"how animals give birth to their young ones","short_answer":"","abstract":"Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring .

Qualitative research is often said to be naturalistic . That is , its goal is to understand behaviour in a natural setting . Two other goals attributed to qualitative research are understanding a phenomenon from the perspective of the research participant and understanding the meanings people give to their experience . It attempts to do this by using so - called naturalistic methods -- interviewing , observation , ethnography , participant observation and focus groups . Each of these methods seeks to understand the perspective of the research participant within the context of their everyday life . This means that the researcher is concerned with asking broad questions that allow the respondent to answer in their own words . These methods allow the researcher to try to qualify their understanding during the research process through further probing questions . In addition , a method such as observation allows the researcher to observe people within natural settings -- particularly those in public places . This has resulted in greater understanding of people 's behaviours in , for example , lifts , public transport , and queues ."},{"query":"who has scored the most goals in a season in the premier league","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who played in it's a mad mad world","short_answer":"","abstract":"It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World is a 1963 American epic comedy film , produced and directed by Stanley Kramer and starring Spencer Tracy with an all - star cast , about the madcap pursuit of $350,000 in stolen cash by a diverse and colorful group of strangers .

The term may be misleading , as it implies that the animal has no choice but to breathe through its nose ; however , it is commonly used to describe cases where effective breathing through the mouth is possible but not preferred . Alternatively , the term has been defined by some as the ability to breathe through the nose while swallowing . While this ability is a common trait of obligate nasal breathers , clearly this definition does not require that nasal breathing in any way be obligatory to the animal . Even in obligate nasal breathers such as horses , rabbits , and rodents , there is a potentially patent path for air to travel from the mouth to the lungs which can be used for endotracheal intubation . It has been suggested that obligate nasal breathing is an adaptation especially useful in prey species , as it allows an animal to feed while preserving their ability to detect predators by scent ."},{"query":"who was the original singer of the night the lights went out in georgia","short_answer":"Vicki Lawrence","abstract":"\`\` The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia '' is a Southern Gothic song , written in 1972 by songwriter Bobby Russell and sung by Vicki Lawrence , an American singer , actress , and comedian .
