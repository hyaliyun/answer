This method of pollination is done by manually transferring pollen from the stamen of one plant to the pistil of another . This is often done with a cotton swab or small brush , but can also be done by removing the petals from a male flower and brushing it against the stigmas of female flowers , but can also be done by simply shaking flowers in the case of bisexual flowers , such as tomatoes . Common reasons for choosing this method include the lack of pollinators , keeping control of cross-pollination between varieties grown together , and creating specific hybrids . Examples of this are vanilla plants , which are transported to areas where its natural pollinator does n't exist , or plants grown in greenhouses , urban areas , or with a cover to control pests , where natural pollinators can not reach them . Pollinator decline and the concentrated pollination needs of monoculture can also be a factor . However , these are not the only reasons , and variable techniques for hand - pollination have arisen for many specialty crops . For instance , hand - pollination is used with date palms to avoid wasting space and energy growing sufficient male plants for adequate natural pollination . Because of the level of labor involved , hand - pollination is only an option on a small scale , used chiefly by small market gardeners and owners of individual plants . On large - scale operations , such as field crops , orchards , or commercial seed production , honeybees or other pollinators are a more efficient approach to pollination management . Despite this , hand - pollination is a fairly widespread practice . Pears grown in Hanyuan County , China have been hand - pollinated since the 1980s , because they ca n't be pollinated with other varieties that have different flowering times ; also , lice infestation requires the use of many insecticide sprays , which causes local beekeepers to refuse to lend beehives ."},{"query":"which were the only parts of africa to remain free of colonial rule","short_answer":"","abstract":"The history of external colonisation of Africa can be divided into two stages : Classical antiquity and European colonialism .

A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T.

T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) .

Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"when was the first metro train introduced in india and where","short_answer":"","abstract":"24 Stations ( Line 1 / North South Metro ) 12 Stations ( Line 2 / East West Metro ) 12 Stations ( Line 3 / Joka - B.B.D.

Within the last million years , most of the Midwestern United States and much of Canada were covered at one time or another with an ice sheet . This continental glacier had a profound effect on the surface features of the area over which it moved . Vast quantities of rock and soil were scraped from the glacial centers to its margins by slowly moving ice and redeposited as drift or till . Much of this drift was dumped into old preglacial river valleys , while some of it was heaped into belts of hills ( terminal moraines ) at the margin of the glacier . The chief result of glaciation has been the modification of the preglacial topography by the deposition of drift over the countryside . However , continental glaciers possess great power of erosion and may actually modify the preglacial land surface by scouring and abrading rather than by the deposition of the drift ."},{"query":"where is the mississippi river located on the united states map","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Mississippi River is the chief river of the second - largest drainage system on the North American continent , second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system .

The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney .

It depends on the body 's mass distribution and the axis chosen , with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body 's rotation rate . It is an extensive ( additive ) property : for a point mass the moment of inertia is just the mass times the square of the distance to the rotation axis . The moment of inertia of a rigid composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems ( all taken about the same axis ) . Its simplest definition is the second moment of mass with respect to distance from an axis . For bodies constrained to rotate in a plane , only their moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane , a scalar value , matters . For bodies free to rotate in three dimensions , their moments can be described by a symmetric 3 × 3 matrix , with a set of mutually perpendicular principal axes for which this matrix is diagonal and torques around the axes act independently of each other ."},{"query":"when does an interaction occur in an experiment","short_answer":"","abstract":"In statistics , an interaction may arise when considering the relationship among three or more variables , and describes a situation in which the simultaneous influence of two variables on a third is not additive .

Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves .

The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States .

Seawater is slightly basic ( meaning pH > 7 ) , and ocean acidification involves a shift towards pH - neutral conditions rather than a transition to acidic conditions ( pH < 7 ) . An estimated 30 -- 40 % of the carbon dioxide from human activity released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans , rivers and lakes . To achieve chemical equilibrium , some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid . Some of the resulting carbonic acid molecules dissociate into a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion , thus increasing ocean acidity ( H ion concentration ) . Between 1751 and 1996 , surface ocean pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14 , representing an increase of almost 35 % in H ion concentration in the world 's oceans .

They are primarily composed of polymers of actin , but in cells are modified by and interact with numerous other proteins .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"when has the national debt been the highest","short_answer":"","abstract":"The history of the United States public debt started with federal government debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War by the first U.S treasurer , Michael Hillegas , after its formation in 1789 .

The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals , each to catch the previously swallowed animal . There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics , especially for the description of swallowing each animal . The spider and fly are described in each verse , but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird . The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman 's death : the logic of swallowing of even more animals of preposterous sizes without dying , contrasted with the expected , matter - of - fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself , when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd . This song for children appeals to their initial logic that a fly can be swallowed by an old lady . A spider would also be seen as logical and physically possible . As you get to the bird , it slowly becomes clear for the child that it 's part of an imaginary scenario leading to a whole horse being swallowed . The last sentence brings the child back to a rational understanding that the old lady is in fact dead of course as physically this is impossible making place for children 's amusement and laughter ."},{"query":"how many pages does the book 1984 have","short_answer":"","abstract":"Nineteen Eighty - Four , often published as 1984 , is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .
