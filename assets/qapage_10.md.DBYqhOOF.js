The script predates the Greek alphabet by several centuries. The oldest Mycenaean writing dates to about 1450 BC.[1] It is descended from the older Linear A, an undeciphered earlier script used for writing the Minoan language, as is the later Cypriot syllabary, which also recorded Greek. Linear B, found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos, Cydonia,[2] Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae,[3] disappeared with the fall of Mycenaean civilization during the Late Bronze Age collapse. The succeeding period, known as the Greek Dark Ages, provides no evidence of the use of writing. It is also the only one of the prehistoric Aegean scripts to have been deciphered, by English architect and self-taught linguist Michael Ventris.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinear B consists of around 87 syllabic signs and over 100 ideographic signs. These ideograms or \\"signifying\\" signs symbolize objects or commodities. They have no phonetic value and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application of Linear B appears to have been confined to administrative contexts. In all the thousands of clay tablets, a relatively small number of different \\"hands\\" have been detected: 45 in Pylos (west coast of the Peloponnese, in southern Greece) and 66 in Knossos (Crete).[5] It is possible that the script was used only by a guild of professional scribes who served the central palaces.[citation needed] Once the palaces were destroyed, the script disappeared.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinear B has roughly 200 signs, divided into syllabic signs with phonetic values and ideograms with semantic values. The representations and naming of these signs have been standardized by a series of international colloquia starting with the first in Paris in 1956. After the third meeting in 1961 at the Wingspread Conference Center in Racine, Wisconsin, a standard proposed primarily by Emmett L. Bennett, Jr. (1918ÿ2011), became known as the Wingspread Convention, which was adopted by a new organization, the Comit International Permanent des tudes Mycniennes (CIPEM), affiliated in 1970 by the fifth colloquium with UNESCO. Colloquia continue: the 13th occurred in 2010 in Paris.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the signs are identical or similar to those in Linear A; however, Linear A encodes an as-yet unknown language, and it is uncertain whether similar signs had the same phonetic values.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grid developed during decipherment by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick of phonetic values for syllabic signs is shown below.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitial consonants are in the leftmost column; vowels are in the top row beneath the title. The transcription of the syllable (it may not have been pronounced that way) is listed next to the sign along with Bennett's identifying number for the sign preceded by an asterisk (as was Ventris' and Chadwick's convention).[note 1] In cases where the transcription of the sign remains in doubt, Bennett's number serves to identify the sign.[10] The signs on the tablets and sealings often show considerable variation from each other and from the representations below. Discovery of the reasons for the variation and possible semantic differences is a topic of ongoing debate in Mycenaean studies.\\r\\n\\r\\n*08\\r\\n\\r\\n*38\\r\\n\\r\\n*28\\r\\n\\r\\n*61\\r\\n\\r\\n*10\\r\\n\\r\\n*01\\r\\n\\r\\n*45\\r\\n\\r\\n*07\\r\\n\\r\\n*14\\r\\n\\r\\n*51\\r\\n\\r\\n*57\\r\\n\\r\\n*46\\r\\n\\r\\n*36\\r\\n\\r\\n*77\\r\\n\\r\\n*44\\r\\n\\r\\n*67\\r\\n\\r\\n*70\\r\\n\\r\\n*81\\r\\n\\r\\n*80\\r\\n\\r\\n*13\\r\\n\\r\\n*73\\r\\n\\r\\n*15\\r\\n\\r\\n*23\\r\\n\\r\\n*06\\r\\n\\r\\n*24\\r\\n\\r\\n*30\\r\\n\\r\\n*52\\r\\n\\r\\n*55\\r\\n\\r\\n*03\\r\\n\\r\\n*72\\r\\n\\r\\n*39\\r\\n\\r\\n*11\\r\\n\\r\\n*50\\r\\n\\r\\n*16\\r\\n\\r\\n*78\\r\\n\\r\\n*21\\r\\n\\r\\n*32\\r\\n\\r\\n*60\\r\\n\\r\\n*27\\r\\n\\r\\n*53\\r\\n\\r\\n*02\\r\\n\\r\\n*26\\r\\n\\r\\n*31\\r\\n\\r\\n*09\\r\\n\\r\\n*41\\r\\n\\r\\n*12\\r\\n\\r\\n*58\\r\\n\\r\\n*59\\r\\n\\r\\n*04\\r\\n\\r\\n*37\\r\\n\\r\\n*05\\r\\n\\r\\n*69\\r\\n\\r\\n*54\\r\\n\\r\\n*75\\r\\n\\r\\n*40\\r\\n\\r\\n*42\\r\\n\\r\\n*17\\r\\n\\r\\n*74\\r\\n\\r\\n*20\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the grid, the first edition of Documents contained a number of other signs termed \\"homophones\\" because they appeared at that time to resemble the sounds of other syllables and were transcribed accordingly: pa2 and pa3 were presumed homophonous to pa. Many of these were identified by the second edition and are shown in the \\"special values\\" below.[11] The second edition relates: \\"It may be taken as axiomatic that there are no true homophones.\\" The unconfirmed identifications of *34 and *35 as ai2 and ai3 were removed. pa2 became qa.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther values remain unknown, mainly because of scarcity of evidence concerning them.[11][note 3] Note that *34 and *35 are mirror images of each other but whether this graphic relationship indicates a phonetic one remains unconfirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent times, CIPEM inherited the former authority of Bennett and the Wingspread Convention in deciding what signs are \\"confirmed\\" and how to officially represent the various sign categories. In editions of Mycenaean texts, the signs whose values have not been confirmed by CIPEM are always transcribed as numbers preceded by an asterisk (e.g., *64). CIPEM also allocates the numerical identifiers, and until such allocation, new signs (or obscured or mutilated signs) are transcribed as a bullet-point enclosed in square brackets: [?].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe signs are approximationseach may be used to represent a variety of about 70 distinct combinations of sounds, within rules and conventions. The grid presents a system of monosyllabic signs of the type V/CV. Clarification of the 14 or so special values tested the limits of the grid model, but Chadwick in the end concluded that even with the ramifications, the syllabic signs can unexceptionally be considered monosyllabic.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible exceptions, Chadwick goes on to explain, include the two diphthongs, ???(ai) and ???(au), as in ??????????, ai-ku-pi-ti-jo, for Aiguptios (ʽ???, \\"Egyptian\\") and ??????, au-ke-wa, for Augews (ʽ?ۚ?ϫ? \\"Augeas\\").[note 4] However, a diphthong is by definition two vowels united into a single sound and therefore might be typed as just V. Thus ???(rai), as in ??????,?e-rai-wo, for elaiwon (?ϫ),[note 5] is of the type CV. Diphthongs are otherwise treated as two monosyllables: ????????, a-ro-u-ra, for arourans (accusative plural of ?ϫ, \\"tamarisk trees\\"), of the types CV and V.[14] Lengths of vowels and accents are not marked.\\r\\n\\r\\n???(Twe), ???(two), ???(dwe), ???(dwo), ???(nwa) and the more doubtful ???(swi) and ???(swa) may be regarded as beginning with labialized consonants, rather than two consonants, even though they may alternate with a two-sign form: o-da-twe-ta and o-da-tu-we-ta for Odatwenta; a-si-wi-jo and a-swi-jo for Aswios (??). Similarly, ???(rya), ???(ryo) and ???(tya) begin with palatalized consonants rather than two consonants: -ti-ri-ja for -trja (-ϫ).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one sign Chadwick tags as the exception to the monosyllabic rule is ???(pte), but this he attributes to a development pte<*pje as in kleptei<*klep-jei.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinear B does not consistently distinguish between voiced and unvoiced stop consonants (except in the dental series) and between aspirated and unaspirated stops even when these distinctions are phonemic in Mycenaean Greek. For example,[15] pa-te is patr (ϫ?), pa-si is phsi (ҿ?);[note 6] p on the other hand never represents : ϫ?? (\\"basileus\\", meaning in this period \\"court official or local chieftain\\") is qa-si-re-u[note 7]); ko-ru is korus (??, \\"helmet\\"), ka-ra-we is grwes (plural of ϻ??), ko-no is skhoinos (\\"rope\\"). Exceptionally, however, the dentals are represented by a t-series and a d-series for unvoiced and voiced: to-so for tosos (?? or ??) but do-ra for dra (plural of Ѵ?, \\"gift\\"). Aspiration, however, is not marked: to-ra-ke for thrkes (plural of Ĳ?ϫ, \\"breastplate\\"). In other cases aspiration can be marked but is optional: pu-te for phutr (\\"planter\\", from ?), but phu-te-re for phutres (\\"planters\\"). Initial aspiration  may be marked only in the case of initial a and rarely: ha-te-ro for hateron (masculine ??),[16] and yet a-ni-ja for hniai (??ϫ).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe j-series represents the semivowel equivalent to English \\"y\\", and is used word-initially and as an intervocalic glide after a syllable ending in i: -a-jo for -ϫ?? (-aios); a-te-mi-ti-jo for ?϶?? (Artemitios). The w-series similarly are semivowels used word-initially and intervocalically after a syllable ending in u: ku-wa-no for kuanos (?ϫ?, \\"blue\\").[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe r-series includes both the /r/ and /l/ phonemes: ti-ri-po for tripos (??, i.e. ??) and tu-ri-so for Tulisos (??).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe q-series is used for monosyllables beginning with a class of consonants that disappeared from classical Greek by regular phonetic change: the labialized velar consonants (see under Mycenaean Greek). These had entered the language from various sources: inheritance from Proto-Indo-European, assimilation, borrowing of foreign words, especially names. In Mycenaean they are /k?/, /g?/, and rarely /k?h/ in names and a few words:[18] a-pi-qo-ro for amphiquoloi (?׶?); qo-u-ko-ro for guoukoloi (?. \\"cowherders\\"); -qo-i-ta for -??.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome consonants in some contexts are not written (but are understood): word-initial s- and -w before a consonant, as in pe-ma for sperma (?ϫ, \\"seed\\"); syllable-final -l, -m, -n, -r, -s; only word-final velars are notated by plene writing: a-to-ro-qo for anthrquos (?Ĳ?, \\"human being, person\\"). In the first example, the pe-, which was primarily used as its value pe of grid class CV, is being used for sper-, not in that class. This was not an innovative or exceptional use, but followed the stated rules. Similarly, a, being primarily of grid class V, is being used as an- and could be used for al, am, ar, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nClusters of two or three consonants that do not follow the initial s- and -w rule or the double consonants: ?(ks or x), ?(ps) and qus (which later did not exist in classical Greek) were represented by the same number of signs of type CV as the cluster had consonants: ko-no-so for Knsos,[note 8] ku-ru-so for khrusos (翼??, \\"gold\\"). The consonants were the same as in the cluster. The vowels so introduced have been called \\"empty\\", \\"null\\", \\"extra\\", \\"dead\\" and other terms by various writers as they represent no sound. The sign was not alphabetic: rules governed the selection of the vowel and therefore of the sign. The vowel had to be the same as the one of the first syllable following the cluster or if at the end of the word, preceding: ti-ri-po with ti- (instead of ta-, te- and so on) to match -ri-.  A rare exception occurs in words formed from wa-na-ka, wanax (??ϫ, Homeric and Classical ?ϫ): wa-na-ka-te for wanaktei (dative), and wa-na-ka-te-ro for wanakteros, the adjectival form.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinear B also uses a large number of ideograms. They express:\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are typically at the end of a line before a number and appear to signify the object the number applies to. Many of the values remain unknown or disputed. Some commodities such as cloth and containers are divided into many different categories represented by distinct ideograms. Livestock may be marked with respect to their sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe numerical references for the ideograms were originally devised by Ventris and Bennett, divided into functional groups corresponding to the breakdown of Bennett's index. These groups are numbered beginning 100, 110, 120 etc., with some provision of spare numbers for future additions; the official CIPEM numberings used today are based on Ventris and Bennett's numbering, with the provision that three or four letter codes (written in small capitals), based on Latin words that seemed relevant at the time, are used where the meanings are known and agreed. Unicode (as of version 5.0) encodes 123 Linear B ideograms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ideograms are symbols, not pictures of the objects in questione.g. one tablet records a tripod with missing legs, but the ideogram used is of a tripod with three legs. In modern transcriptions of Linear B tablets, it is typically convenient to represent an ideogram by its Latin or English name or by an abbreviation of the Latin name. Ventris and Chadwick generally used English; Bennett, Latin. Neither the English nor the Latin can be relied upon as an accurate name of the object; in fact, the identification of some of the more obscure objects is a matter of exegesis.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nInscriptions in Linear B have been found on tablets and vases or other objects; they are catalogued and classified by, inter alia, the location of the excavation they were found in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother 170 inscriptions in Linear B have been found on various vessels, for a total of some 6,058 known inscriptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest Linear B tablets are probably those from the Room of Chariot Tablets at Knossos, and date to the latter half of the 15th century BC.[30]  The Kafkania pebble, though from an earlier context, is not genuine.[31] The earliest inscription from the mainland is an inscribed clay tablet found at Iklaina dating to between 1400 and 1350 BC.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is claimed that a Linear B inscription is attested on an amber bead found as far at Bernstorf, in Germany.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aegean is responsible for many of the early Greek language words that have to do with daily life such as words for tools and items that are seen every day. [34]The sequence and the geographical spread of Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear A, and Linear B, the three overlapping, but distinct, writing systems on Bronze Age Crete, the Aegean islands, and mainland Greece are summarized as follows:[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main archives for Linear B are associated with these stages of Late Minoan and Helladic pottery:[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Knossos archive was dated by Arthur Evans to the destruction by conflagration of about 1400 BC, which would have baked and preserved the clay tablets. He dated this event to the LM II period. This view stood until Carl Blegen excavated the site of ancient Pylos in 1939 and uncovered tablets inscribed in Linear B. They were fired in the conflagration that destroyed Pylos about 1200 BC, at the end of LHIIIB. With the decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris in 1952, serious questions about Evans' date began to be considered. Most notably, Blegen said that the inscribed stirrup jars, which are oil flasks with stirrup-shaped handles, imported from Crete around 1200 were of the same type as those dated by Evans to the destruction of 1400. Blegen found a number of similarities between 1200 BC Pylos and 1400 BC Knossos and suggested the Knossian evidence be reexamined, as he was sure of the 1200 Pylian date.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe examination uncovered a number of difficulties. The Knossos tablets had been found at various locations in the palace. Evans had not kept exact records. Recourse was had to the day books of Evans' assistant, Duncan Mackenzie, who had conducted the day-to-day excavations. There were discrepancies between the notes in the day books and Evans' excavation reports. Moreover, the two men had disagreed over the location and strata of the tablets. The results of the reinvestigation were eventually published by Palmer and Boardman, On the Knossos Tablets.[38] It contains two works, Leonard Robert Palmer's The Find-Places of the Knossos Tablets and John Boardman's The Date of the Knossos Tablets, representing Blegen's and Evans' views respectively. Consequently, the dispute was known for a time as \\"the Palmer-Boardman dispute\\". There has been no generally accepted resolution to it yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major cities and palaces used Linear B for records of disbursements of goods. Wool, sheep, and grain were some common items, often given to groups of religious people and to groups of \\"men watching the coastline\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tablets were kept in groups in baskets on shelves, judging by impressions left in the clay from the weaving of the baskets. When the buildings they were housed in were destroyed by fires, many of the tablets were fired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British archaeologist Arthur Evans, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, was presented by Greville Chester in 1886 with a sealstone from Crete engraved with a writing he took to be Mycenaean.[39] Heinrich Schliemann had encountered signs similar to these, but had never identified the signs clearly as writing, relating in his major work on Mycenae that \\"of combinations of signs resembling inscriptions I have hitherto only found three or four ....\\"[40] In 1893 Evans purchased more sealstones in Athens. He verified from the antiquarian dealers that the stones came from Crete. During the next year he noticed the script on other artefacts in the Ashmolean. In 1894, he embarked for Crete in search of the script. Almost immediately on arrival, he jumped into a trench at Knossos and saw the sign of the double axe on a palace wall. He knew he had found the source of the script. Subsequently, he found more stones being worn by Cretan women as amulets. They were called ϫ?Ϛ? \\"milk-stones\\" and had come from the various ruins.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1894, Evans published his theories that the signs evidenced various phases in the development of a writing system in The Journal of Hellenic Studies, the first article being \\"Primitive Pictographs and a Prae-Phoenician Script from Crete\\".[41] In these articles Evans distinguished between \\"pictographic writing\\" and \\"a linear system of writing\\". He did not explicitly define these terms, causing some confusion among subsequent writers concerning what he meant, but in 1898 he wrote[42] \\"These linear forms indeed consist of simple geometrical figures which unlike the more complicated pictorial class were little susceptible to modification,\\" and \\"That the linear or quasi-alphabetic signs ... were in the main ultimately derived from the rudely scratched line pictures belonging to the infancy of art can hardly be doubted.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Evans began to negotiate for the land purchase of the Knossos site. He established the Cretan Exploration Fund, with only his own money at first, and by 1896 the fund had purchased one-fourth of Kephala Hill, on which the ruins were located, with first option to buy the rest. However, he could not obtain a firman excavation permit from the Ottoman government. He returned to Britain. In January 1897, the Christian population of Crete staged its final insurrection against the Ottoman Empire. The last Ottoman troops were ferried off the island by the British fleet on December 5, 1898.[43] In that year also, Evans and his friends returned to finish paying for the site. By this time, the Fund had other contributors as well.[44] In 1899, the Constitution of a new Cretan Republic went into effect. Once Arthur had received permission to excavate from the local authorities, excavation on the hill began on 23 March 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Evans' report to the British School at Athens for that year,[45] on April 5, the excavators discovered the first large cache ever of Linear B tablets among the remains of a wooden box in a disused terracotta bathtub. Subsequently, caches turned up at multiple locations, including the Room of the Chariot Tablets, where over 350 pieces from four boxes were found. The tablets were 4.5?cm (1.8?in) to 19.5?cm (7.7?in) long by 1.2?cm (0.47?in) to 7.2?cm (2.8?in) wide and were scored with horizontal lines over which text was written in about 70 characters. Even in this earliest excavation report, Evans could tell that \\"...a certain number of quasi-pictorial characters also occur which seem to have an ideographic or determinative meaning.\\"[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe excavation was over for that year by June 2. Evans reported: \\"only a comparatively small proportion of the tablets were preserved in their entirety,\\"[45] the causes of destruction being rainfall through the roof of the storage room, crumbling of small pieces, and being thrown away by workmen who failed to identify them. A report on September 6 to the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland[46] began to use some of the concepts characteristic of Evans' later thought: \\"palace of Knossos\\" and \\"palace of Minos\\". Appletons' Cyclop?dia of American Biography, 1900,[47] notes that Evans took up Stillman's theme that the palace was the labyrinth of mythology in which the half-bovine son of King Minos lurked. In the report, the tablets are now called a \\"linear script\\" as opposed to the \\"hieroglyphic or conventionalized pictographic script\\". The linear script has characters that are \\"of a free, upright, European character\\" and \\"seem to have been for the most part syllabic\\". Evans reasserts the ideographic idea: \\"a certain number are unquestionably ideographic or determinative.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe years after 1900 were consumed by excavations at Knossos and the discovery and study by Evans of tablets there and elsewhere, but nothing substantially new occurred. Evans planned a comprehensive work on Cretan scripts to be called Scripta Minoa. A year before the publication of volume I, he began to drop hints that he now believed the linear script was two scripts, to be presented in the forthcoming book.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Scripta Minoa I,[48] which appeared in 1909, he explained that the discovery of the Phaistos Disc in July 1908 had caused him to pull the book from the presses so that he could include the disk by permission, as it had not yet been published. On the next page[49] he mentioned that he was also including by permission of Federico Halbherr of the Italian Mission in Crete unpublished tablets from Hagia Triada written in a linear script of \\"Class A\\". To what degree if any Halbherr was responsible for Evans' division of the \\"linear script\\" into \\"Class A\\" and \\"Class B\\" is not stated. The Knossos tablets were of Class B, so that Evans could have perceived Class A only in tablets from elsewhere, and so recently that he needed permission to include the examples.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvans summarized the differences between the two scripts as \\"type\\" or \\"form of script;' that is, varieties in the formation and arrangement of the characters. For example, he says \\"the clay documents belonging to Class A show a certain approximation in their forms to those presenting the hieroglyphic inscriptions ... the system of numerals is also in some respects intermediate between that of the hieroglyphic documents and that of the linear Class B.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first volume covered \\"the Hieroglyphic and Primitive Linear Classes\\" in three parts: the \\"pre-Phoenician Scripts of Crete\\", the \\"Pictorial Script\\" and \\"the Phaistos Disk\\". One or two more volumes publishing the Linear A and Linear B tablets were planned, but Evans ran out of time; the project required more than one man could bring to it. For a good many of the years left to him, he was deeply enmeshed in war and politics in the Balkans. When he did return to Knossos, completion and publication of the palace excavations took priority. His greatest work, Palace of Minos, came out in 1935. It did include scattered descriptions of tablets. He died in 1941, soon after Nazi forces invaded Crete.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Knossos tablets had remained in the museum at Irakleion, Crete, where many of them now were missing. The unpublished second volume consisted of notes by Evans and plates and fonts created by Clarendon Press. In 1939, Carl Blegen had uncovered the Pylos Tablets; pressure was mounting to finish Scripta Minoa II. After Evans' death, Alice Kober, assistant to John Myres and a major transcriber of the Knossos tablets, prompted Myres to come back from retirement and finish the work. Emmett L. Bennett, Jr. added more transcriptions. The second volume came out in 1952 with Evans cited as author and Myres as editor,[51] just before the discovery that Linear B writes an early form of Greek. An impatient Ventris and Chadwick declared: \\"Two generations of scholars had been cheated of the opportunity to work constructively on the problem.\\"[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the limited source materials, during this time there were efforts to decipher the newly discovered Cretan script. Australian classicist Florence Stawell published an interpretation of the Phaistos Disc in the April 1911 issue of The Burlington Magazine.[53] She followed this with the book A Clue to the Cretan Scripts, published in 1931. Stawell declared all three Cretan script forms to represent early Homeric Greek, and offered her attempts at translations. Also in 1931, F. G. Gordon's Through Basque to Minoan was published by the Oxford University Press. Gordon attempted to prove a close link between the Basque language and Linear B, without lasting success.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949, the distinguished Professor Bed?ich Hrozny of Prague published Les Inscriptions Crtoises, Essai de dchiffrement, a proposed decipherment of the Cretan scripts.[55] Hrozny was internationally renowned as the translator of Hittite cuneiform decades previously. His Minoan translations into academic French, proved to be considerably subjective, and incorrect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1930s to 1950s there was correspondence between, and papers published by, various international academic figures. These included Johannes Sundwall, K. D. Ktistopoulos, Ernst Sittig and V. I. Georgiev.[56] None of them succeeded with decipherment, yet they added to knowledge and debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the same time, Professor Alice Kober studied Linear B and managed to construct grids, linking similar symbols in groups of threes.[57] Kober noticed that a number of Linear B words had common roots and suffixes. This led her to believe that Linear B represented an inflected language, with nouns changing their endings depending on their case. However, some characters in the middle of the words seemed to correspond with neither a root nor a suffix. Because this effect was found in other known languages, Kober surmised that the odd characters were bridging syllables, with the beginning of the syllable belonging to the root and the end belonging to the suffix. This was a reasonable assumption, since Linear B had far too many characters to be considered alphabetic and too few to be logographic; therefore, each character should represent a syllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Kober also showed that the two symbol word for 'total' at the end of livestock and personnel lists, had a different symbol for gender. This gender change with one letter, usually a vowel, is most frequent in Indo-European languages.[58] Kober had rejected any speculation on the language represented, preferring painstaking cataloguing and analysis of the actual symbols.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention for numbering the symbols still in use today was first devised by United States Professor Emmett L. Bennett, Jr.. Working alongside fellow academic Alice Kober, by 1950 Bennett had deciphered the metrical system, based on his intensive study of Linear B tablets unearthed at Pylos. He was also an early proponent of the idea that Linear A and B represented different languages. Bennett's book The Pylos Tablets became a crucial resource for Michael Ventris, who later described it as \\"a wonderful piece of work\\".[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1935, the British School at Athens was celebrating its fiftieth anniversary with an exhibition at Burlington House, London. Among the speakers was Arthur Evans, then eighty-four years old. The teenaged Michael Ventris was present in the audience.[61] In 1940, the 18-year-old Ventris had an article Introducing the Minoan Language published in the American Journal of Archaeology.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter wartime service as a navigator with RAF Bomber Command, and a post-war year in Occupied Germany, he returned to civilian life, and completed qualification as an architect. Despite having no university qualification, Ventris continued with his amateur interest in Linear B, corresponding with known scholars, who usually but not always replied.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Ventris and John Chadwick performed the bulk of the decipherment of Linear B between 1951 and 1953. At first Ventris chose his own numbering method, but later switched to Bennett's system. His initial decipherment was achieved using Kober's classification tables, to which he applied his own theories. Some Linear B tablets had been discovered on the Greek mainland. Noticing that certain symbol combinations appeared only on the tablets found in Crete, he conjectured that these might be names of places on the island. This proved to be correct. Working with the symbols he could decipher from this, Ventris soon unlocked much text and determined that the underlying language of Linear B was in fact Greek. This contradicted general scientific views of the time, and indeed Ventris himself had previously agreed with Evans' hypothesis that Linear B was not Greek.\\r\\n\\r\\nVentris' discovery was of significance in demonstrating a Greek-speaking Minoan-Mycenaean culture on Crete, and thus presenting Greek in writing centuries earlier than had been previously accepted.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nChadwick, a university lecturer in Ancient Greek philology, helped Ventris develop his decipherment of the text and discover the vocabulary and grammar of Mycenaean Greek. He noted:[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat any Linear B tablets are written in a language other than Greek still remains to be demonstrated; but that words and usages not exactly paralleled in later Greek occur is both certain and to be expected. But we must not resort to \\"non-Greek\\" whenever we come up against an insoluble problem.\\r\\nLinear B was added to the Unicode Standard in April, 2003 with the release of version 4.0.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Linear B Syllabary block is U+10000ÿU+1007F.\\r\\nThe Linear B Ideograms block is U+10080ÿU+100FF.\\r\\nThe Unicode block for the related Aegean Numbers is U+10100ÿU+1013F.","input":"What was the writing system of the minoan called?"},{"output":"El Oued","context":"El Oued (Arabic: ????????, meaning the Valley) or Oued Souf is a city, and the capital of El Oued Province, in Algeria. The oasis town is watered by an underground river, hence its name is El Oued which enables date palm cultivation and the rare use (for the desert) of brick construction for housing. As most roofs are domed, it is known as the \\"City of a Thousand Domes\\".[2]\\r\\nEl Oued is located 400 miles (640?km) south east of Algiers (the capital city of Algeria), near the Tunisian border.

Upon its entry to the air-breathing world, the newborn must begin to adjust to life outside the uterus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPerfusing its body by breathing independently instead of utilizing placental oxygen delivered via the umbilical cord is the first challenge of a newborn. At birth, the baby's lungs are filled with lung liquid, which is distinct from amniotic fluid.[1] When the newborn is expelled from the birth canal, its central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment.[2] This triggers it to take the first breath, within about 10 seconds after delivery.[2] With the first breaths, there is a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, and an increase in the surface area available for gas exchange. Over the next 30 seconds the pulmonary blood flow increases and is oxygenated as it flows through the alveoli of the lungs. Oxygenated blood now reaches the left atrium and ventricle, and through the descending aorta reaches the umbilical arteries. Oxygenated blood now stimulates constriction of the umbilical arteries resulting in a reduction in placental blood flow. As the pulmonary circulation increases there is an equivalent reduction in the placental blood flow which normally ceases completely after about three minutes. These two changes result in a rapid redirection of blood flow into the pulmonary vascular bed, from approximately 4% to 100% of cardiac output. The increase in pulmonary venous return results in left atrial pressure being slightly higher than right atrial pressure, which closes the foramen ovale. The flow pattern changes results in a drop in blood flow across the ductus arteriosus and the higher blood oxygen content of blood within the aorta stimulates the constriction and ultimately the closure of this fetal circulatory shunt.\\r\\nAll of these cardiovascular system changes result in the adaptation from fetal circulation patterns to an adult circulation pattern. During this transition, some types of congenital heart disease that were not symptomatic in utero during fetal circulation will present with cyanosis or respiratory signs.\\r\\nIt is common obstetric practice to intervene in these changes by applying a clamp to the umbilical cord, often within 20 seconds of birth, before transition has taken place. However delayed clamping (>1min) may have benefits in terms of iron status.[3]\\r\\nFollowing birth, the expression and re-uptake of surfactant, which begins to be produced by the fetus at 20 weeks gestation, is accelerated. Expression of surfactant into the alveoli is necessary to prevent alveolar closure (atelectasis). At this point, rhythmic breathing movements also commence. If there are any problems with breathing, management can include stimulation, bag and mask ventilation, intubation and ventilation. Cardiorespiratory monitoring is essential to keeping track of potential problems. Pharmacological therapy such as caffeine can also be given to treat apnea in premature newborns. A positive airway pressure should be maintained, and neonatal sepsis must be ruled out.\\r\\nPotential neonatal respiratory problems include apnea, transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTNB), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), airway obstruction, and pneumonia.\\r\\nEnergy metabolism in the fetus must be converted from a continuous placental supply of glucose to intermittent feeding. While the fetus is dependent on maternal glucose as the main source of energy, it can use lactate, free-fatty acids, and ketone bodies under some conditions. Plasma glucose is maintained by glycogenolysis.\\r\\nGlycogen synthesis in the liver and muscle begins in the late second trimester of pregnancy, and storage is completed in the third trimester. Glycogen stores are maximal at term, but even then, the fetus only has enough glycogen available to meet energy needs for 8ÿ10 hours, which can be depleted even more quickly if demand is high. Newborns will then rely on gluconeogenesis for energy, which requires integration, and is normal at 2ÿ4 days of life.\\r\\nFat stores are the largest storage source of energy. At 27 weeks gestation, only 1% of a fetus' body weight is fat. At 40 weeks, that number increases to 16%. Inadequate available glucose substrate can lead to hypoglycemia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, or other problems. Similarly, excess substrate can lead to problems, such as infant of a diabetic mother (IDM), hypothermia or neonatal sepsis.\\r\\nAnticipating potential problems is the key to managing most neonatal problems of energy metabolism. For example, early feeding in the delivery room or as soon as possible may prevent hypoglycemia. If the blood glucose is still low, then an intravenous (IV) bolus of glucose may be delivered, with continuous infusion if necessary. Rarely, steroids or glucagon may have to be employed.\\r\\nNewborns come from a warm environment to the cold and fluctuating temperatures of this world. They are naked, wet, and have a large surface-area-to-mass ratio, with variable amounts of insulation, limited metabolic reserves, and a decreased ability to shiver. Physiologic mechanisms for preserving core temperature include vasoconstriction (decrease blood flow to the skin), maintaining the fetal position (decrease the surface area exposed to the environment), jittery large muscle activity (generate muscular heat), and \\"non-shivering thermogenesis\\". The latter occurs in \\"brown fat\\" which is specialized adipose tissue with a high concentration of mitochondria designed to rapidly oxidize fatty acids in order to generate metabolic heat. The newborn capacity to maintain these mechanisms is limited, especially in premature infants. As such, it is not surprising that some newborns may have problems regulating their temperature. As early as the 1880s, infant incubators were used to help newborns maintain warmth, with humidified incubators being used as early as the 1930s.\\r\\nBasic techniques for keeping newborns warm include keeping them dry, wrapping them in blankets, giving them hats and clothing, or increasing the ambient temperature. More advanced techniques include incubators (at 36.5?C), humidity, heat shields, thermal blankets, double-walled incubators, and radiant warmers while the use of skin-to-skin \\"kangaroo care\\" interventions for low-birth-weight infants have started to spread worldwide after its use as a solution in developing countries.[4]","input":"When does a baby take their first breath?"},{"output":"general-purpose alternating-current (AC) electric power supply","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMains electricity (as it is known in the UK and Canada; US terms include grid power, wall power, and domestic power) is the general-purpose alternating-current (AC) electric power supply. It is the form of electrical power that is delivered to homes and businesses, and it is the form of electrical power that consumers use when they plug domestic appliances, televisions and electric lamps into wall outlets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two principal properties of the electric power supply, voltage and frequency, differ between regions. A voltage of (nominally) 230?V and a frequency of 50?Hz is used in Europe, most of Africa, most of Asia, much of South America and Australia. In North America, the most common combination is 120?V and a frequency of 60?Hz.  Other voltages exist, and some countries may have, for example, 230?V but 60?Hz. This is a concern to travellers, since portable appliances designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate with, or may even be destroyed by another. The use of different and incompatible plugs and sockets in different regions and countries provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, mains electric power is referred to by several names including \\"household power\\", \\"household electricity\\", \\"house current\\", \\"powerline\\", \\"domestic power\\", \\"wall power\\", \\"line power\\", \\"AC power\\", \\"city power\\", \\"street power\\", and \\"electrical grid\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, mains electric power is generally referred to as \\"the mains\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a list of voltages, frequencies, and wall plugs by country, see Mains electricity by country\\r\\n\\r\\nWorldwide, many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting. The different systems are primarily characterized by their\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these parameters vary among regions. The voltages are generally in the range 100ÿ240 V (always expressed as root-mean-square voltage). The two commonly used frequencies are 50?Hz and 60?Hz. Single-phase or three-phase power is most commonly used today, although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century. Foreign enclaves, such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases, may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas. Some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside (e.g. in Libya). Regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority, with electric power provided by incompatible private sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used, with frequencies between 25?Hz and 133?Hz and voltages from 100?V to 250?V. Direct current (DC) has been almost completely displaced by alternating current (AC) in public power systems, but DC was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century. The modern combinations of 230?V/50?Hz and 120?V/60?Hz, listed in IEC 60038, did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal. Industrial plants with three-phase power will have different, higher voltages installed for large equipment (and different sockets and plugs), but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity is used for lighting, heating, cooling, electric motors and electronic equipment.  The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has published:\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimated US residential electricity consumption by end use, for the year 2016[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nElectronic appliances (such as those in the televisions, computer and related equipment categories above, representing 9% of the total), typically use an AC to DC converter or AC adapter to power the device. This is often capable of operation over the approximate range of 100?V to 250?V and at 50?Hz to 60?Hz. The other categories are typically AC applications and usually have much more restricted input ranges. A study by the Building Research Establishment in the UK states that \\"The existing 230?V system is well suited to the future of electricity whether through design or Darwinian processes. Any current perceived weakness is generally a result of cost reduction and market forces rather than any fundamental technical difficulties. Questions as to whether there are alternatives to the existing 230?V AC system are often overshadowed by legacy issues, the future smart agenda and cost in all but specific situations. Where opportunities do exist they are often for specific parts of the overall load and often small parts in terms of total demand.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many countries, household power is single-phase electric power, with two or three wired contacts at each outlet. Neutral and line wires carry current and are defined as live parts.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn northern and central Europe, residential electrical supply is commonly 400?V three-phase electric power, which gives 230?V between any single phase and neutral; house wiring may be a mix of three-phase and single-phase circuits, but three-phase residential use is rare in the UK. High-power appliances such as kitchen stoves, water heaters and maybe household power heavy tools like log splitters may be supplied from the 400?V three-phase power supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious earthing systems are used to ensure that the ground and neutral wires have zero voltage with respect to earth, to prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment. In some installations, there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a single-phase three-wire. Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables (these exist with either two or three insulated conductors) terminated in a plug, which is inserted into a fixed receptacle (socket). Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power. These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircuit breakers and fuses are used to detect short circuits between the line and neutral or ground wires or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle (overload protection) to prevent overheating and possible fire. These protective devices are usually mounted in a central panelmost commonly a distribution board or consumer unitin a building, but some wiring systems also provide a protection device at the socket or within the plug. Residual-current devices, also known as ground-fault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters, are used to detect ground faults - flow of current in other than the neutral and line wires (like the ground wire or a person). When a ground fault is detected, the device quickly cuts off the circuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and most of South America use a supply that is within 6% of 230?V. In the UK and Australia[5] the nominal supply voltage is 230?V +10%/?6% to accommodate the fact that most supplies are in fact still 240?V. The United States uses a supply voltage of 120 volts +/- 6%. Japan, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, North America, Central America and some parts of northern South America use a voltage between 100?V and 127?V. The 230?V standard has become widespread so that 230?V equipment can be used in most parts of the world with the aid of an adapter or a change to the equipment's connection plug for the specific country.\\r\\n\\r\\nA distinction should be made between the voltage at the point of supply (nominal voltage at the point of interconnection between the electrical utility and the user) and the voltage rating of the equipment (utilization voltage). Typically the utilization voltage is 3% to 5% lower than the nominal system voltage; for example, a nominal 208?V supply system will be connected to motors with \\"200?V\\" on their nameplates. This allows for the voltage drop between equipment and supply. Voltages in this article are the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages. Power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature. Voltages are expressed as root mean square (RMS) voltage. Voltage tolerances are for steady-state operation. Momentary heavy loads, or switching operations in the power distribution network, may cause short-term deviations out of the tolerance band and storms and other unusual conditions may cause even larger transient variations. In general, power supplies derived from large networks with many sources are more stable than those supplied to an isolated community with perhaps only a single generator.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choice of supply voltage is due more to historical reasons than optimization of the electric power distribution systemonce a voltage is in use and equipment using this voltage is widespread, changing voltage is a drastic and expensive measure. A 230?V distribution system will use less conductor material than a 120?V system to deliver a given amount of power because the current, and consequently the resistive loss, is lower. While large heating appliances can use smaller conductors at 230?V for the same output rating, few household appliances use anything like the full capacity of the outlet to which they are connected. Minimum wire size for hand-held or portable equipment is usually restricted by the mechanical strength of the conductors. Electrical appliances are used extensively in homes in both 230?V and 120?V system countries. National electrical codes prescribe wiring methods intended to minimize the risk of electric shock and fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany areas, such as the US, which use (nominally) 120?V make use of three-wire, split-phase 240?V systems to supply large appliances. In this system a 240?V supply has a centre-tapped neutral to give two 120?V supplies which can also supply 240?V to loads connected between the two line wires. Three-phase systems can be connected to give various combinations of voltage, suitable for use by different classes of equipment. Where both single-phase and three-phase loads are served by an electrical system, the system may be labelled with both voltages such as 120/208 or 230/400?V, to show the line-to-neutral voltage and the line-to-line voltage. Large loads are connected for the higher voltage. Other three-phase voltages, up to 830 volts, are occasionally used for special-purpose systems such as oil well pumps. Large industrial motors (say, more than 250?hp or 150?kW) may operate on medium voltage. On 60?Hz systems a standard for medium voltage equipment is 2400/4160?V (2300/4000?V in the US) whereas 3300?V is the common standard for 50?Hz systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing voltage harmonisation, electricity supplies within the European Union are now nominally 230?V I10% at 50 Hz.[6] For a transition period (1995ÿ2008), countries that had previously used 220?V changed to a narrower asymmetric tolerance range of 230?V +6%/?10% and those (like the UK) that had previously used 240?V changed to 230?V +10%/?6%.[7] No change in voltage is required by either system as both 220?V and 240?V fall within the lower 230?V tolerance bands (230?V I10%). Some areas of the UK still have 250?volts for legacy reasons, but these also fall within the 10% tolerance band of 230?volts. In practice, this allows countries to continue to supply the same voltage (220 or 240?V), at least until existing supply transformers are replaced. Equipment (with the exception of filament bulbs) used in these countries is designed to accept any voltage within the specified range. In the United States[8] and Canada,[9] national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120?V and allow a range of 114?V to 126?V (RMS) (?5% to +5%). Historically 110?V, 115?V and 117?V have been used at different times and places in North America. Mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110?V; however, 120?V is the nominal voltage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Australia converted to 230?V as the nominal standard with a tolerance of +10%/?6%,[10] this superseding the old 240?V standard, AS2926-1987.  As in the UK, 240?V is within the allowable limits and \\"240 volt\\" is a synonym for mains in Australian and British English.  In Japan, the electrical power supply to households is at 100?V. Eastern and northern parts of Honsh (including Tokyo) and Hokkaid have a frequency of 50?Hz, whereas western Honsh (including Nagoya, Osaka, and Hiroshima), Shikoku, Kysh and Okinawa operate at 60?Hz.  The boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) substations which interconnect the power between the two grid systems; these are Shin Shinano, Sakuma Dam, Minami-Fukumitsu, and the Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter.  To accommodate the difference, frequency-sensitive appliances marketed in Japan can often be switched between the two frequencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first public electricity supply was a water wheel driven system constructed in the small English town of Godalming in 1881.  It was an alternating current (AC) system using a Siemens alternator supplying power for both street lights and consumers at two voltages, 250?V for arc lamps, and 40?V for incandescent lamps.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first large scale central plantThomas Edisons steam powered station at Holborn Viaduct in Londonstarted operation in January 1882, providing direct current (DC) at 110?V.[12] The Holborn Viaduct station was used as a proof of concept for the construction of the much larger Pearl Street Station in Manhattan, the world's first permanent commercial central power plant. The Pearl Street Station also provided DC at 110?V, considered to be a \\"safe\\" voltage for consumers, beginning September 4, 1882.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAC systems started appearing in the US in the midÿ1880s, using higher distribution voltage stepped down via transformers to the same 110?V customer utilization voltage that Edison used. In 1883 Edison patented a threeÿwire distribution system to allow DC generation plants to serve a wider radius of customers to save on copper costs. By connecting two groups of 110?V lamps in series more load could be served by the same size conductors run with 220?V between them; a neutral conductor carried any imbalance of current between the two sub-circuits. AC circuits adopted the same form during the War of Currents, allowing lamps to be run at around 110?V and major appliances to be connected to 220?V.  Nominal voltages gradually crept upward to 112?V and 115?V, or even 117?V.[citation needed] After World War II the standard voltage in the U.S. became 117?V, but many areas lagged behind even into the 1960s.[citation needed] In 1967 the nominal voltage rose to 120?V, but conversion of appliances was slow.[citation needed] Today, virtually all American homes and businesses have access to 120 and 240?V at 60?Hz.  Both voltages are available on the three wires (two \\"hot\\" legs of opposite phase and one \\"neutral\\" leg).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1899, the Berliner Elektrizit?ts-Werke (BEW), a Berlin electrical utility, decided to greatly increase its distribution capacity by switching to 220?V nominal distribution, taking advantage of the higher voltage capability of newly developed metal filament lamps. The company was able to offset the cost of converting the customer's equipment by the resulting saving in distribution conductors cost. This became the model for electrical distribution in Germany and the rest of Europe and the 220?V system became common. North American practice remained with voltages near 110?V for lamps.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first decade after the introduction of alternating current in the US (from the early 1880s to about 1893) a variety of different frequencies were used, with each electric provider setting their own, so that no single one prevailed.  The most common frequency was 133??Hz.[citation needed] The rotation speed of induction generators and motors, the efficiency of transformers, and flickering of carbon arc lamps all played a role in frequency setting.  Around 1893 the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States and AEG in Germany decided to standardize their generation equipment on 60?Hz and 50?Hz respectively, eventually leading to most of the world being supplied at one of these two frequencies. Today most 60?Hz systems deliver nominal 120/240?V, and most 50?Hz nominally 230?V. The significant exceptions are in Brazil, which has a synchronized 60?Hz grid with both 127?V and 220?V as standard voltages in different regions, and Japan, which has two frequencies: 50?Hz for East Japan and 60?Hz for West Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo maintain the voltage at the customer's service within the acceptable range, electrical distribution utilities use regulating equipment at electrical substations or along the distribution line. At a substation, the step-down transformer will have an automatic on-load tap changer, allowing the ratio between transmission voltage and distribution voltage to be adjusted in steps. For long (several kilometres) rural distribution circuits, automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line. These are autotransformers, again, with on-load tapchangers to adjust the ratio depending on the observed voltage changes. At each customer's service, the step-down transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment, usually I5% of the nominal voltage. Since these taps are not automatically controlled, they are used only to adjust the long-term average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stability of the voltage and frequency supplied to customers varies among countries and regions. \\"Power quality\\" is a term describing the degree of deviation from the nominal supply voltage and frequency. Short-term surges and drop-outs affect sensitive electronic equipment such as computers and flat panel displays. Longer-term power outages, brown-outs and black outs and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers, who may have to invest in uninterruptible power supply or stand-by generator sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable. Erratic power supply may be a severe economic handicap to businesses and public services which rely on electrical machinery, illumination, climate control and computers. Even the best quality power system may have breakdowns or require servicing. As such, companies, governments and other organizations sometimes have backup generators at sensitive facilities, to ensure that power will be available even in the event of a power outage or black out.\\r\\n\\r\\nPower quality can also be affected by distortions of the current or voltage waveform in the form of harmonics of the fundamental (supply) frequency, or non-harmonic (inter)modulation distortion such as that caused by RFI or EMI interference.  In contrast, harmonic distortion is usually caused by conditions of the load or generator. In multi-phase power, phase shift distortions caused by imbalanced loads can occur.","input":"What type of electricity is in a house?"},{"output":"Great Pyramid of Giza","context":"The Seven Wonders of the World or the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is a list of remarkable constructions of classical antiquity given by various authors in guidebooks or poems popular among ancient Hellenic tourists. Although the list, in its current form, did not stabilise until the Renaissance, the first such lists of seven wonders date from the 1st-2nd century BC. The original list inspired innumerable versions through the ages, often listing seven entries. Of the original Seven Wonders, only onethe Great Pyramid of Giza, the oldest of the ancient wondersremains relatively intact. The Colossus of Rhodes, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Temple of Artemis and the Statue of Zeus were all destroyed. The location and ultimate fate of the Hanging Gardens are unknown, and there is speculation that they may not have existed at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek conquest of much of the known western world in the 4th century BC gave Hellenistic travellers access to the civilizations of the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians.[1] Impressed and captivated by the landmarks and marvels of the various lands, these travellers began to list what they saw to remember them.[2][3]\\r\\nInstead of \\"wonders\\", the ancient Greeks spoke of \\"theamata\\" (Ĳ?ϫϫ), which means \\"sights\\", in other words \\"things to be seen\\" (? ?? Ĳ?ϫϫ ?? ??? [??] T hept themata ts oikoumens [gs]). Later, the word for \\"wonder\\" (\\"thaumata\\" Ĳϫ?ϫϫ, \\"wonders\\") was used.[4] Hence, the list was meant to be the Ancient World's counterpart of a travel guidebook.[1]\\r\\nThe first reference to a list of seven such monuments was given by Diodorus Siculus.[5][6] The epigrammist Antipater of Sidon[7] who lived around or before 100 BC,[8] gave a list of seven such monuments, including six of the present list (substituting the walls of Babylon for the lighthouse):[9]\\r\\nI have gazed on the walls of impregnable Babylon along which chariots may race, and on the Zeus by the banks of the Alpheus, I have seen the hanging gardens, and the Colossus of the Helios, the great man-made mountains of the lofty pyramids, and the gigantic tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the sacred house of Artemis that towers to the clouds, the others were placed in the shade, for the sun himself has never looked upon its equal outside Olympus. ÿ Greek Anthology IX.58\\r\\nAnother 2nd century BC observer, who claimed to be the mathematician Philo of Byzantium,[10] wrote a short account entitled The Seven Sights of the World. However, the incomplete surviving manuscript only covered six of the supposedly seven places, which agreed with Antipater's list.[3]\\r\\nEarlier and later lists by the historian Herodotus (484 BCÿca. 425 BC) and the architect Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305ÿ240 BC), housed at the Museum of Alexandria, survived only as references.\\r\\nThe Colossus of Rhodes was the last of the seven to be completed, after 280 BC, and the first to be destroyed, by an earthquake in 226/225 BC. Hence, all seven existed at the same time for a period of less than 60 years.\\r\\nThe list covered only the sculptural and architectural monuments of the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions,[10] which then comprised the known world for the Greeks. Hence, extant sites beyond this realm were not considered as part of contemporary accounts.[1]\\r\\nThe primary accounts, coming from Hellenistic writers, also heavily influenced the places included in the wonders list. Five of the seven entries are a celebration of Greek accomplishments in the arts and architecture (the exceptions being the Pyramids of Giza and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon).\\r\\nThe seven wonders on Antipater's list won praises for their notable features, ranging from superlatives of the highest or largest of their types, to the artistry with which they were executed. Their architectural and artistic features were imitated throughout the Hellenistic world and beyond.\\r\\nThe Greek influence in Roman culture, and the revival of Greco-Roman artistic styles during the Renaissance caught the imagination of European artists and travellers.[15] Paintings and sculptures alluding to Antipater's list were made, while adventurers flocked to the actual sites to personally witness the wonders. Legends circulated to further complement the superlatives of the wonders.\\r\\nOf Antipater's wonders, the only one that has survived to the present day is the Great Pyramid of Giza. Its brilliant white stone facing had survived intact until around 1300 AD, when local communities removed most of the stonework for building materials. The existence of the Hanging Gardens has not been proven, although theories abound.[16] Records and archaeology confirm the existence of the other five wonders. The Temple of Artemis and the Statue of Zeus were destroyed by fire, while the Lighthouse of Alexandria, Colossus, and tomb of Mausolus were destroyed by earthquakes. Among the artifacts to have survived are sculptures from the tomb of Mausolus and the Temple of Artemis in the British Museum in London.\\r\\nStill, the listing of seven of the most marvellous architectural and artistic human achievements continued beyond the Ancient Greek times to the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and to the modern age. The Roman poet Martial and the Christian bishop Gregory of Tours had their versions.[1] Reflecting the rise of Christianity and the factor of time, nature and the hand of man overcoming Antipater's seven wonders, Roman and Christian sites began to figure on the list, including the Colosseum, Noah's Ark and Solomon's Temple.[1][3] In the 6th century, a list of seven wonders was compiled by St. Gregory of Tours: the list[17] included the Temple of Solomon, the Pharos of Alexandria and Noah's Ark.\\r\\nModern historians, working on the premise that the original Seven Ancient Wonders List was limited in its geographic scope, also had their versions to encompass sites beyond the Hellenistic realmfrom the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World to the Seven Wonders of the World. Indeed, the \\"seven wonders\\" label has spawned innumerable versions among international organizations, publications and individuals based on different themesworks of nature, engineering masterpieces, constructions of the Middle Ages, etc. Its purpose has also changed from just a simple travel guidebook or a compendium of curious places, to lists of sites to defend or to preserve.","input":"What were the seven ancient wonders of the world?"},{"output":"April 1861","context":"The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag, is the national flag of the United States. It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the \\"union\\") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S.[1] Nicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes,[2] Old Glory,[3] and the Star-Spangled Banner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current design of the U.S. flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over 57 years.[4]\\r\\nThe Continental Colors\\r\\n(aka the \\"Grand Union Flag\\")\\r\\nFlag of the British East India Company, 1707ÿ1801\\r\\nAt the time of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with \\"stars, white in a blue field\\" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as \\"the Continental Colors\\" has historically been referred to as the first national flag.[5]\\r\\nThe Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independencelikely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripesand would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs.[5][6]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grand Union\\" was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the U.S. flag.[6]\\r\\nThe flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the company flag inspired the design.[7] Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, one of the three maritime flags used throughout the British Empire at the time. However, an East India Company flag could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.[8] Benjamin Franklin once gave a speech endorsing the adoption of the Company's flag by the United States as their national flag. He said to George Washington, \\"While the field of your flag must be new in the details of its design, it need not be entirely new in its elements. There is already in use a flag, I refer to the flag of the East India Company.\\"[9] This was a way of symbolising American loyalty to the Crown as well as the United States' aspirations to be self-governing, as was the East India Company. Some colonists also felt that the Company could be a powerful ally in the American War of Independence, as they shared similar aims and grievances against the British government tax policies. Colonists therefore flew the Company's flag, to endorse the Company.[10]\\r\\nHowever, the theory that the Grand Union Flag was a direct descendant of the flag of the East India Company has been criticised as lacking written evidence.[11] On the other hand, the resemblance is obvious, and a number of the Founding Fathers of the United States were aware of the East India Company's activities and of their free administration of India under Company rule.[11] In any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.\\r\\nOn June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\"[12] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year. While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment.[13]\\r\\nThe first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by Congress for his coat for the flag.[14]\\r\\nThe 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign. In the late 18th century, the notion of a national flag did not yet exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern \\"it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States.\\"[15] However, the term, \\"Standard,\\" referred to a national standard for the Army of the United States. Each regiment was to carry the national standard in addition to its regimental standard. The national standard was not a reference to the national or naval flag.[16]\\r\\nThe Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa.[17] The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial.[18] One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.[19]\\r\\nDespite the 1777 resolution, the early years of American independence featured many different flags. Most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. While there are many examples of 13-star arrangements, some of those flags included blue stripes[20] as well as red and white. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, in a letter dated October 3, 1778, to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, described the American flag as consisting of \\"13 stripes, alternately red, white, and blue, a small square in the upper angle, next the flag staff, is a blue field, with 13 white stars, denoting a new Constellation.\\"[21] John Paul Jones used a variety of 13-star flags on his U.S. Navy ships including the well-documented 1779 flags of the Serapis and the Alliance. The Serapis flag had three rows of eight-pointed stars with stripes that were red, white, and blue. The flag for the Alliance, however, had five rows of eight-pointed stars with 13 red and white stripes, and the white stripes were on the outer edges.[22] Both flags were documented by the Dutch government in October 1779, making them two of the earliest known flags of 13 stars.[23]\\r\\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag[24] while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.[25] Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.[26] In this letter, he asked for a \\"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \\"great Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the first bill; the \\"Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the second bill; and \\"the Naval Flag of the States\\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones ÿ in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.[27] Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;[28] whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones.[29] Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal.[27] When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.[30] The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.[31][32] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.[33][34] Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle.[35]\\r\\nThe origin of the stars and stripes design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the descendants of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870.[36] By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776.[37] Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.[38]\\r\\nThe family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag.[39] Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.[40][41] According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.[42]\\r\\nIn 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", later known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", which is now the American national anthem. The flag is currently on display in the exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem\\" at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.[43]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid[44] in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.[45]\\r\\nPrior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century there was an abundance of different star patterns, rectangular and circular.\\r\\nOn July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in longest use, surpassing the 48-star flag that was used from 1912 to 1959.\\r\\nThe U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (GuҊngzhu) in China in 1784 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of ginseng.[46] There it gained the designation \\"Flower Flag\\" (Chinese: ; pinyin: huq; Cantonese Yale: fke).[47] According to a pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later retold by author and U.S. naval officer George H. Preble:\\r\\nWhen the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing a flag \\"as beautiful as a flower\\". Every body went to see the kwa kee chuen [; Fkesyhn], or \\"flower flagship\\". This name at once established itself in the language, and America is now called the kwa kee kwoh [??; Fkegwok], the \\"flower flag country\\"and an American, kwa kee kwoh yin [??; Fkegwokyhn]\\"flower flag countryman\\"a more complimentary designation than that of \\"red headed barbarian\\"the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.[48][49]\\r\\nIn the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[50] Other Asian nations have equivalent terms for America, for example Vietnamese: Hoa K? (\\"Flower Flag\\"). Chinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: ˇ; traditional Chinese: ˇ??; pinyin: Migu܇. Mi is short for Miljin (simplified Chinese: ˇͫ; traditional Chinese: ˇͫ??, phono-semantic matching of \\"American\\") and \\"gu܇\\" means \\"country\\", so this name is unrelated to the flag. However, the \\"flower flag\\" terminology persists in some places today: for example, American Ginseng is called simplified Chinese: y; traditional Chinese: ??; literally: \\"flower flag ginseng\\" in Chinese, and Citibank, which opened a branch in China in 1902, is known as 跐k; \\"Flower Flag Bank\\".[50]\\r\\nThe U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787ÿ90 on board the Columbia.[47] William Driver, who coined the phrase \\"Old Glory\\", took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831ÿ32.[47] The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world journey in 1871.[51]\\r\\nIn the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag were not standardized until 1934.[52]\\r\\nIn the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico voted to become a U.S. state. However, the legitimacy of the result of this election was disputed.[54] On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but it had a turnout of only 23%.[55][56] Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.[57]\\r\\nThe modern meaning of the flag was forged in April 1861, when Major Robert Anderson defended Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. The Confederates shot at the flag and Anderson was forced to surrender. The modern meaning of the flag was forged by Anderson's stand at Fort Sumter; he was celebrated in the North as a hero. Harold Holzer states that New York City:\\r\\nAuthor Adam Goodheart argues after this opening event move of the American Civil War, the flag was used throughout northern states to symbolize U.S. nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\\r\\nBefore that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flewas it does today, and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.\\r\\nÿ Adam Goodheart.[59]\\r\\nThe flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage, but remains protected as free speech. Scholars have noted the irony that \\"[t]he flag is so revered because it represents the land of the free, and that freedom includes the ability to use or abuse that flag in protest\\".[60] In worldwide comparison, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also \\"beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects\\".[61]\\r\\nThe man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag was Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his grandparents in Ohio.[62] He received a B? on the project.[63] According to Heft, his history teacher honored their agreement to change his grade to an A after his design was selected.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C.??1; 4 U.S.C.??2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states. The specification gives the following values:\\r\\nThese specifications are contained in an executive order which, strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal government.[67] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes are 2 G 3?ft. or 4 G 6?ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 G 4?ft. or 5 G 8?ft. (1.6), or 3 G 5?ft. or 6 G 10?ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators are provided in these sizes.[68] Flags that are made to the prescribed 1.9 ratio are often referred to as \\"G-spec\\" (for \\"government specification\\") flags.\\r\\nThe exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are \\"White\\", \\"Old Glory Red\\", and \\"Old Glory Blue\\".[69] The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946.[70] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing. The \\"relative\\" coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag's \\"white\\".\\r\\nAs with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \\"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\\"[72]\\r\\nSometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002.[73] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should be \\"(1) the same colors used in the United States flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the Pantone Matching System.\\"[74]\\r\\nWhen Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.[76] At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.\\r\\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a Bÿ for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.[77] According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project.[65] The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.[65]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \\"...?is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy?...\\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.[78] Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,[79][80] most recently and forcefully in Colorado v. Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals judgment that was released in May 2010.[81] Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all occasions.\\r\\nThe flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5 feet (0.91 by 1.52?m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying \\"this flag dips to no earthly king\\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.[82][83]\\r\\nThe flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)[84]\\r\\nThe Flag Code prohibits using the flag \\"for any advertising purpose\\" and also states that the flag \\"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\\".[85] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\\r\\nSection 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: \\"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\\", and \\"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\\". Section 3 of the Flag Code[86] defines \\"the flag\\" as anything \\"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\\".\\r\\nAn additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \\"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforcedindeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.[87] Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\\r\\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\\r\\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module, Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \\"streaming\\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\\r\\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.[88] Several US military uniforms, such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Air Force and Navy, have the flag patch on the left shoulder.[89][90]\\r\\nOther organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction. The congressional charter of the Boy Scouts of America stipulates that Boy Scout uniforms should not imitate U.S. military uniforms; consequently, the flags are displayed on the right shoulder with the stripes facing front, the reverse of the military style.[91] Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch, either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.\\r\\nEvery U.S. astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case, the canton was on the left.\\r\\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.[92] Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\\r\\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.[43]\\r\\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\\r\\nThe flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:[108]\\r\\nThe flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\\r\\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.[112]\\r\\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\\r\\nNational Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. In 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.[109][118][109]\\r\\nThough not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use. To properly fold the flag:\\r\\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.[119][120]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals,[121] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.[122]\\r\\nFlag of Bikini Atoll\\r\\nFlag of Liberia\\r\\nFlag of Malaysia\\r\\nFlag of El Salvador 1875ÿ1912\\r\\nFlag of Brittany","input":"When did the american flag become a symbol?"},{"output":"Norse sailors (often called Vikings) from Iceland","context":"The exploration of North America by non-indigenous people was a continuing effort to map and explore the continent of North America. It spanned centuries, and consisted of efforts by numerous people and expeditions from various foreign countries to map the continent. The European colonization of the Americas followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Sagas of Icelanders, Norse sailors (often called Vikings) from Iceland first settled Greenland in the 980s. Erik the Red explored and settled southwestern Greenland, which he named to Garrett Spears potential Icelandic settlers, eventually establishing the Eastern and Western Settlements, which were abandoned around 1350.\\r\\nL'Anse aux Meadows, an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, and a second site in southwestern Newfoundland, are the only known sites of a Norse village in North America outside of Greenland. These sites are notable for their possible connections with the attempted colony of Vinland established by Leif Erikson in 1003.\\r\\nThe Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the Old World, and Europeans remained ignorant of the existence of the Americas as a whole, until the first decades following the year 1492. Many expeditions were launched from European nations in search of a Northwest Passage to East Asia (or \\"the Indies\\" as the region was called) in order to establish a shorter trade route to China than the Silk Road, a trade route which had become desperately needed and yet exacerbated by the Fall of Constantinople. Also, the Castilian crown needed an alternative to the Portuguese controlled eastern maritime trade route around Africa to India and East Asia.\\r\\nOn August 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from the Port of Palos de la Frontera in the Province of Huelva, from the newly los Reyes Cat܇licos coordinated Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, in present-day Spain, financed by Queen Isabella I of Castille. Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage of his discovery of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola spread the news across Europe quickly. Columbus rediscovered and explored much of the Lesser Antilles in his second voyage then discovered both Trinidad and Tobago on his third voyage whilst skirting the northern South American coast. His fourth voyage was spent scanning the Central American coast. The Voyages of Christopher Columbus opened the New World.\\r\\nItalian navigator and explorer Giovanni Caboto (known in English as John Cabot) is credited with the discovery of continental North America on June 24, 1497, under the commission of Henry VII of England. Though the exact location of his discovery remains disputed, the Canadian and United Kingdom governments' official position is that he landed on the island of Newfoundland. The English presence through Giovanni Caboto was signaled in Juan de la Cosa's map of 1500.\\r\\nIn 1499 Jo?o Fernandes Lavrador was licensed by the King of Manuel I of Portugal and together with Pro de Barcelos they reached Greenland and sighted Labrador for the first time since Leif Erikson, which was granted and named after Lavrador. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.[1] Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 the brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte Real explored and named the coasts of Greenland, Labrador and also Newfoundland, naming \\"Terra Verde\\" the explored North American coasts.[2] Both explorations were signaled in 1502 Cantino planisphere.\\r\\nIt was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia, but rather found what was to Europeans a New World, which in 1507 was named \\"America\\", probably after Amerigo Vespucci, on the Waldseemller map.\\r\\nIn 1500, Pedro lvares Cabral was sent by Portugal to explore South America. He is considered to be the discoverer of Brazil.\\r\\nAragon King Ferdinand II sent Juan Ponce de Le܇n from the fledgling colony on Hispaniola to verify rumors of undiscovered land to the northwest. On April 2, 1513, Ponce de Le܇n disembarked on the northeast coast of what he named Florida for the crown. The exact location is disputed, but historians have offered the possibilities of St. Augustine, Ponce de Le܇n Inlet, and Melbourne Beach. He encountered the powerful Gulf Stream and found a passage through the Florida Keys to land on the southwestern Gulf Coast of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. Again, the exact location is disputed.[3] While it is true that Columbus visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1493, Ponce de Leon was the first known European to reach the present-day United States (mainland).[4]\\r\\nOn September 25, 1513, Spanish conquistador Vasco N~?ez de Balboa was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean once he crossed the Isthmus of Panama. He claimed all the territory touching it for the Crown, later to affect colonization of Las Californias.\\r\\nAround 1519-1521, Portuguese explorer Jo?o lvares Fagundes explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and Nova Scotia, with a mission to create colonies.\\r\\nIn 1524, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed for King Francis I of France and is known as the first European since the Norse to explore the Atlantic coast of North America. Arriving near the Cape Fear River delta, he explored the coastlines of present-day states of South Carolina and North Carolina, entering the Pamlico Sound, and bypassing entrances to the Chesapeake Bay. Believing the New York Harbor to be a lake, he sailed past Long Island, exploring Narragansett Bay and Newfoundland.\\r\\nIn 1524-1525, Portuguese explorer Estev?o Gomes, on behalf of Charles I of Spain, explored present-day Nova Scotia sailing South along the Maine coast. Gomes entered New York Harbor and saw the Hudson River(which he named the \\"San Antonio River\\"). Because of his expedition, the 1529 Diogo Ribeiro world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly.\\r\\nIn 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gasp Peninsula, on the Gulf Gulf of Saint Lawrence and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. In 1535 Cartier explored the St. Lawrence river and also claimed the region for France.\\r\\nAfter two failed attempts to reach East Asia by circumnavigating Siberia, Henry Hudson sailed west in 1609 under the Dutch East India Company. He, too, passed Cape Cod, Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware Bay, instead sailing up the Hudson River on September 11, 1609 in search of a fabled connection to the Pacific via what was actually the Great Lakes. In Hudson's fourth and final voyage, he discovered, mapped, and explored the Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay and James Bay.\\r\\nOther major sea-based explorers were Captain James Cook, George Vancouver, and Charles Wilkes.\\r\\nThere were numerous Spanish explorers and conquistadors who explored the Southwest of North America (including present-day west and central United States) and cross the continent (east to west) in its southern regions, mainly from the second quarter to the middle of the 16th century, such as lvar N~?ez Cabeza de Vaca and Francisco Vsquez de Coronado, but also the North American Southeast and south-central regions, s Soto]].\\r\\nIn 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, which would become the first permanent settlement and the capital of New France. He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior. Champlain himself discovered Lake Champlain in 1609. By 1615, he had travelled by canoe up the Ottawa River through Lake Nipissing and Georgian Bay to the centre of Huron country near Lake Simcoe. During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result, the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts.\\r\\nFrom 1679 to 1682 Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire course of Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nFrom 1697 to 1702 Eusebio Kino explored the Sonoran Desert and on his journey to the Colorado River Delta discovered an overland route to Baja California that was then commonly believed to be an island. In 1683 Kino lead the first European overland crossing of Baja California.\\r\\nEuropean exploration of western Canada was largely motivated by the fur trade and the search for the elusive Northwest Passage. Hudson's Bay Company explorer Henry Kelsey has the distinction of being the first European to see the northern Great Plains in 1690.\\r\\nAnthony Henday was the first to have seen the Rocky Mountains, in 1754, but curiously did not mention it in his journals. From his westernmost geographic position (roughly near the town of Olds, Alberta, halfway between Calgary and Red Deer, Alberta) the Rockies should have been quite conspicuous, but he was likely trying to disguise the disappointing fact that an unknown range of seemingly impassible mountains now stood between the HBC and the Pacific. Samuel Hearne found the Coppermine River in 1769-71 in his failed search for copper ore deposits. Burned by these shortfalls, the HBC largely quit exploration.\\r\\nThe North West Company, on the other hand, used a business model that required constant expansion into untapped areas. Under the auspices of the NWC, Alexander Mackenzie discovered the Mackenzie River in 1789 and was the first European to reach the North-American Pacific overland, via the Bella Coola River, in 1793. Simon Fraser reached the Pacific in 1808 via the Fraser River.\\r\\nDavid Thompson, widely regarded as the greatest land geographer that ever lived, traveled over 90,000?km during his lifetime. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the Jay Treaty between Great Britain and the United States. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of 6,750?km (4,190?mi) from Grand Portage, through Lake Winnipeg, to the headwaters of the Assiniboine and Mississippi Rivers, as well as two sides of Lake Superior.[5] In 1798, the company sent him to Red Deer Lake (in present-day Alberta) to establish a trading post. The English translation of Lac La Biche-Red Deer Lake-first appeared on the Mackenzie map of 1793.[6] Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the Rocky Mountains. In 1811/1812 he followed the Columbia River to the Pacific, and in 1814 used his notes and measurements to draft the first European-style map of western Canada, covering 3.9 million square kilometres.\\r\\nLewis and Clark were the first Americans to venture into the newly acquired territory of the Louisiana Purchase, at the order of President Thomas Jefferson. They discovered many new geographical features, Indian tribes, and animal and plant species. John Colter was a member of the expedition who subsequently became a guide for others in the 'Old West,' and did some explorations of his own.\\r\\nJohn C. Frmont led many important explorations in the Great Plains, Great Basin, Oregon territory, and Mexican Alta California.\\r\\nJoseph Reddeford Walker was one of the most prominent of the explorers, and charted many new paths through the West, which often were then utilized by emigrants crossing to settle in Western towns and communities. In 1833, his exploring party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada following the Carson River and descending via Stanislaus River drainages to Monterey. His return route across the southern Sierra was via Walker Pass, named after Walker by John Charles Fremont. The approach of the Sierra via the Carson River route later became known as the California Trail, the primary route for the emigrants to the gold fields during the California gold rush.\\r\\nAs the American population of the West increased, the US government launched ongoing official explorations mainly through the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. One of the main officers and explorers in this unit was George Wheeler. In 1872, the US Congress authorized an ambitious plan to map the portion of the United States west of the 100th meridian at a scale of 8?miles to the inch. This plan necessitated what became known as the Wheeler Survey, along with the Clarence King and John Wesley Powell Surveys, and expeditions by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. In 1879, all such efforts were reorganized as the United States Geological Survey.\\r\\nUniversalis Cosmographia, the Waldseemller map dated 1507, depicts the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean separating Asia from the Americas.\\r\\nThe Vinland map surfaced in 1965 and is claimed, though widely discredited, to be a 15th-century map depicting the Norse colony of Vinland.","input":"Who were the first european to reach america?"},{"output":"the Soviet Union","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. Since then, about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched. According to a 2013 estimate, 3,600 remained in orbit.[1] Of those, about 1,000 were operational;[2] while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris. Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 50 are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000?km), and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000?km).[3] A few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, a few asteroids,[4] a comet and the Sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nSatellites are used for many purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit.\\r\\n\\r\\nA launch vehicle is a rocket that places a satellite into orbit. Usually, it lifts off from a launch pad on land. Some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform, or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit).\\r\\n\\r\\nSatellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, thermal control, telemetry, attitude control and orbit control.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Newton's cannonball\\", presented as a \\"thought experiment\\" in A Treatise of the System of the World, by Isaac Newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by Edward Everett Hale, The Brick Moon.[5][6] The idea surfaced again in Jules Verne's The Begum's Fortune (1879).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857ÿ1935) published Exploring Space Using Jet Propulsion Devices (in Russian: ʶ󶶿־ҿ ҰѾ־ ŤѾҰ־ ѿ־ּ ŤҼɾ), which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft. He calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit, and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, Herman Poto?nik (1892ÿ1929) published his sole book, The Problem of Space Travel  The Rocket Motor (German: Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums  der Raketen-Motor). He described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1945 Wireless World article, the English science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke (1917ÿ2008) described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications.[7] He suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US military studied the idea of what was referred to as the \\"earth satellite vehicle\\" when Secretary of Defense James Forrestal made a public announcement on 29 December 1948, that his office was coordinating that project between the various services.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, and initiating the Soviet Sputnik program, with Sergei Korolev as chief designer. This in turn triggered the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. The unanticipated announcement of Sputnik 1's success precipitated the Sputnik crisis in the United States and ignited the so-called Space Race within the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 2 was launched on 3 November 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a dog named Laika.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May, 1946, Project RAND had released the Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship, which stated, \\"A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe United States had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the Bureau of Aeronautics of the United States Navy. The United States Air Force's Project RAND eventually released the report, but considered the satellite to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda, rather than a potential military weapon. In 1954, the Secretary of Defense stated, \\"I know of no American satellite program.\\"[11] In February 1954 Project RAND released \\"Scientific Uses for a Satellite Vehicle,\\" written by R.R. Carhart.[12] This expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in June 1955 with \\"The Scientific Use of an Artificial Satellite,\\" by H.K. Kallmann and W.W. Kellogg.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of activities planned for the International Geophysical Year (1957ÿ58), the White House announced on 29 July 1955 that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as Project Vanguard. On 31 July, the Soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing pressure by the American Rocket Society, the National Science Foundation, and the International Geophysical Year, military interest picked up and in early 1955 the Army and Navy were working on Project Orbiter, two competing programs: the army's which involved using a Jupiter C rocket, and the civilian/Navy Vanguard Rocket, to launch a satellite. At first, they failed: initial preference was given to the Vanguard program, whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television. But finally, three months after Sputnik 2, the project succeeded; Explorer 1 became the United States' first artificial satellite on 31 January 1958.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the Air Force used resources of the United States Space Surveillance Network to catalog 115 Earth-orbiting satellites.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly satellites were constructed as \\"one-off\\" designs. With growth in geosynchronous (GEO) satellite communication, multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses. The first standardized satellite bus design was the HS-333 GEO commsat, launched in 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently the largest artificial satellite ever is the International Space Station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN), a division of the United States Strategic Command, has been tracking objects in Earth's orbit since 1957 when the Soviet Union opened the Space Age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 objects. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The SSN tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger; those now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are space debris.[16] The United States Strategic Command is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three basic categories of non-military satellite services:[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice, data, and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the Earth's surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nMobile satellite systems help connect remote regions, vehicles, ships, people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units, in addition to serving as navigation systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific research satellites provide meteorological information, land survey data (e.g. remote sensing), Amateur (HAM) Radio, and other different scientific research applications such as earth science, marine science, and atmospheric research.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first satellite, Sputnik 1, was put into orbit around Earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit. By far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,459[20] artificial satellites orbiting the Earth. Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude, inclination and eccentricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are Low Earth orbit (LEO), Medium Earth orbit (MEO) and High Earth orbit (HEO). Low Earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km. Medium Earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786?km. High Earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786?km.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe satellite's functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics. Looking at the \\"anatomy\\" of a typical satellite, one discovers two modules.[17] Note that some novel architectural concepts such as Fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bus module consists of the following subsystems:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch, maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit, and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe telemetry subsystem (aka Command and Data Handling, C&DH) monitors the on-board equipment operations, transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station, and receives the earth control station's commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power, regulation and distribution functions, and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the Earth's shadow. Nuclear power sources (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator) have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the Nimbus program (1964ÿ1978).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite's body (e.g. optical solar reflector)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation, control laws embedded in the flight software, and actuators (reaction wheels, thrusters). These apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude, keep the satellite in the correct orbital position, and keep antennas pointed in the right directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders. A transponder is capable of?:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen satellites reach the end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch), satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit. Historically, due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite Vanguard 1. Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1, the 4th manmade satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of  March?2015[update], as well as the upper stage of its launch rocket.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of being de-orbited, most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit.[25] As of 2002, the FCC requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch.[26] In cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting, the major variable is the solar flux, and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself, and the gravitational perturbations generated by the Sun and the Moon (as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges, whether above or below sea level). The nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78?km, with a range between 72 and 84?km. Solar panels, however, are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95?km.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including production of the necessary launch vehicle. Note: many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them, instead relying on foreign launch services. This list does not consider those numerous countries, but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously, and the date this capability was first demonstrated. The list includes the European Space Agency, a multi-national state organization, but does not include private consortiums.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few other private companies are capable of sub-orbital launches.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space,[50] it was launched aboard an American rocket from an American spaceport. The same goes for Australia, who launched first satellite involved a donated U.S. Redstone rocket and American support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the United Kingdom.[51] The first Italian satellite San Marco 1 launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. Scout rocket from Wallops Island (Virginia, United States) with an Italian launch team trained by NASA.[52] By similar occasions, almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets.\\r\\n\\r\\n?-note: Both Chile and Belarus used Russian companies as principal contractors to build their satellites, they used Russian-Ukrainian manufactured rockets and launched either from Russia or Kazakhstan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent times[timeframe?], satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks.[89][90]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor testing purposes, satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth. Russia, the United States and China have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites.[91] In 2007 the Chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite,[91] followed by the US Navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in February 2008.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions, they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters. Such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range. GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming,[93][94] but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.[95][96]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder. It is common for Earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively.[citation needed]","input":"Who invented the first satellite in the world?"},{"output":"carbon","context":"Microbial metabolism is the means by which a microbe obtains the energy and nutrients (e.g. carbon) it needs to live and reproduce.  Microbes use many different types of metabolic strategies and species can often be differentiated from each other based on metabolic characteristics.  The specific metabolic properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's ecological niche, and often allow for that microbe to be useful in industrial processes or responsible for biogeochemical cycles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll microbial metabolisms can be arranged according to three principles:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. How the organism obtains carbon for synthesising cell mass:\\r\\n\\r\\n2. How the organism obtains reducing equivalents used either in energy conservation or in biosynthetic reactions:\\r\\n\\r\\n3. How the organism obtains energy for living and growing:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, these terms are almost freely combined. Typical examples are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nSome microbes are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using organic compounds as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as commensals or parasites) or find in dead organic matter of all kind (saprophages). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many eukaryotic microorganisms are heterotrophic by predation or parasitism, properties also found in some bacteria such as Bdellovibrio (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as Myxococcus (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most pathogenic bacteria can be viewed as heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic polymers such as cellulose, chitin or lignin which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide (mineralization) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes.  There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products.  Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in bioremediation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiochemically, prokaryotic heterotrophic metabolism is much more versatile than that of eukaryotic organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using glycolysis (also called EMP pathway) for sugar metabolism and the citric acid cycle to degrade acetate, producing energy in the form of ATP and reducing power in the form of NADH or quinols.  These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction).  However, many bacteria and archaea utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway (also called ED pathway) in Pseudomonas.  Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the pentose phosphate pathway. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes.  It is also noteworthy that the mitochondrion, the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the endosymbiosis of a bacterium related to obligate intracellular Rickettsia, and also to plant-associated Rhizobium or Agrobacterium.  Therefore, it is not surprising that all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these Proteobacteria.  Most microbes respire (use an electron transport chain), although oxygen is not the only terminal electron acceptor that may be used.  As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nFermentation is a specific type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses organic carbon instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor.  This means that these organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to NAD+ and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and maintaining a supply of NAD+ for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis).  As oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are anaerobic.  Many organisms can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and aerobic respiration when oxygen is present.  These organisms are facultative anaerobes.  To avoid the overproduction of NADH, obligately fermentative organisms usually do not have a complete citric acid cycle.  Instead of using an ATP synthase as in respiration, ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation where a phosphate group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to ADP to form ATP.  As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-containing organic compounds (generally in the form of Coenzyme A-esters) fermentative organisms use NADH and other cofactors to produce many different reduced metabolic by-products, often including hydrogen gas (H2). These reduced organic compounds are generally small organic acids and alcohols derived from pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis. Examples include ethanol, acetate, lactate, and butyrate. Fermentative organisms are very important industrially and are used to make many different types of food products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of each food.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all fermentative organisms use substrate-level phosphorylation. Instead, some organisms are able to couple the oxidation of low-energy organic compounds directly to the formation of a proton (or sodium) motive force and therefore ATP synthesis.  Examples of these unusual forms of fermentation include succinate fermentation by Propionigenium modestum and oxalate fermentation by Oxalobacter formigenes. These reactions are extremely low-energy yielding.  Humans and other higher animals also use fermentation to produce lactate from excess NADH, although this is not the major form of metabolism as it is in fermentative microorganisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethylotrophy refers to the ability of an organism to use C1-compounds as energy sources. These compounds include methanol, methyl amines, formaldehyde, and formate.  Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria Methylomonas and Methylobacter.  Methanotrophs are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use methane (CH4) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (CH2O), formate (HCOO?), and carbon dioxide CO2 initially using the enzyme methane monooxygenase.  As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are obligate aerobes.  Reducing power in the form of quinones and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation.  Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to CO2 (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the serine pathway (Methylosinus, Methylocystis) or the ribulose monophosphate pathway (Methylococcus), depending on the species of methylotroph.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to aerobic methylotrophy, methane can also be oxidized anaerobically. This occurs by a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria and relatives of methanogenic Archaea working syntrophically (see below). Little is currently known about the biochemistry and ecology of this process.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethanogenesis is the biological production of methane.  It is carried out by methanogens, strictly anaerobic Archaea such as Methanococcus, Methanocaldococcus, Methanobacterium,\\r\\nMethanothermus, Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta and Methanopyrus.  The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in nature in its use of a number of unusual cofactors to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran.[1]  These cofactors are responsible (among other things) for the establishment of a proton gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis.  Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized.  Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas (H2)  chemolithoautotrophically.  These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms.  The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth.  This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as interspecies hydrogen transfer.  A second group of methanogens use methanol (CH3OH) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still autotrophic in using CO2 as only carbon source.  The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens.  Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from acetate (CH3COO?) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens.  All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway to fix CO2 and obtain cellular carbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSyntrophy, in the context of microbial metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a chemical reaction that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable.  The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, ethanol and butyrate) by organisms such as Syntrophomonas.  Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable.  However, when a hydrogenotrophic (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10?5 atm) and thereby shift the equilibrium of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (Go) to non-standard conditions (G). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is \\"pulled\\" towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: Go= +48.2 kJ/mol, but G' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10?5 atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from Go= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to G' = -17 kJ/mol at 10?5 atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer.  In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual mineralization of these compounds.  These reactions help prevent the excess sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the biosphere in usable forms such as methane and CO2.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile aerobic organisms during respiration use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, anaerobic organisms use other electron acceptors. These inorganic compounds have a lower reduction potential than oxygen, meaning that respiration is less efficient in these organisms and leads to slower growth rates than aerobes. Many facultative anaerobes can use either oxygen or alternative terminal electron acceptors for respiration depending on the environmental conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost respiring anaerobes are heterotrophs, although some do live autotrophically. All of the processes described below are dissimilative, meaning that they are used during energy production and not to provide nutrients for the cell (assimilative). Assimilative pathways for many forms of anaerobic respiration are also known.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenitrification is the utilization of nitrate (NO?3) as a terminal electron acceptor.  It is a widespread process that is used by many members of the Proteobacteria.  Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential.  Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric iron (Fe3+) and some organic electron acceptors.  Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to nitrite (NO?2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N2) by the enzymes nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively.  Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration.  Some organisms (e.g. E. coli) only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite.  Others (e.g. Paracoccus denitrificans or Pseudomonas stutzeri) reduce nitrate completely.  Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important greenhouse gases that react with sunlight and ozone to produce nitric acid, a component of acid rain.  Denitrification is also important in biological wastewater treatment where it is used to reduce the amount of nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing eutrophication.\\r\\n\\r\\nDissimilatory sulfate reduction is a relatively energetically poor process used by many Gram-negative bacteria found within the deltaproteobacteria, Gram-positive organisms relating to Desulfotomaculum or the archaeon Archaeoglobus. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced as a metabolic end product. For sulfate reduction electron donors and energy are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sulfate reducers are organotrophic, using carbon compounds such as lactate and pyruvate (among many others) as electron donors,[2] while others are lithotrophic, using hydrogen gas (H2) as an electron donor.[3]  Some unusual autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfotignum phosphitoxidans) can use phosphite (HPO?3) as an electron donor[4] whereas others (e.g. Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans, Desulfocapsa thiozymogenes, Desulfocapsa sulfoexigens) are capable of sulfur disproportionation (splitting one compound into two different compounds, in this case an electron donor and an electron acceptor) using elemental sulfur (S0), sulfite (SO2?3), and thiosulfate (S2O2?3) to produce both hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfate (SO2?4).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll sulfate-reducing organisms are strict anaerobes.  Because sulfate is energetically stable, before it can be metabolized it must first be activated by adenylation to form APS (adenosine 5-phosphosulfate) thereby consuming ATP.  The APS is then reduced by the enzyme APS reductase to form sulfite (SO2?3) and AMP.  In organisms that use carbon compounds as electron donors, the ATP consumed is accounted for by fermentation of the carbon substrate.  The hydrogen produced during fermentation is actually what drives respiration during sulfate reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcetogenesis is a type of microbial metabolism that uses hydrogen (H2) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide (CO2) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above).  Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens.  Carbon dioxide reduction in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway.  This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.  Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerric iron (Fe3+) is a widespread anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms.  Electron flow in these organisms is similar to those in electron transport, ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase.  Model organisms include Shewanella putrefaciens and Geobacter metallireducens.  Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. G. metallireducens) can use toxic hydrocarbons such as toluene as a carbon source, there is significant interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich contaminated aquifers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough ferric iron is the most prevalent inorganic electron acceptor, a number of organisms (including the iron-reducing bacteria mentioned above) can use other inorganic ions in anaerobic respiration.  While these processes may often be less significant ecologically, they are of considerable interest for bioremediation, especially when heavy metals or radionuclides are used as electron acceptors.  Examples include:\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of organisms, instead of using inorganic compounds as terminal electron acceptors, are able to use organic compounds to accept electrons from respiration.  Examples include:\\r\\n\\r\\nTMAO is a chemical commonly produced by fish, and when reduced to TMA produces a strong odor.  DMSO is a common marine and freshwater chemical which is also odiferous when reduced to DMS.  Reductive dechlorination is the process by which chlorinated organic compounds are reduced to form their non-chlorinated endproducts.  As chlorinated organic compounds are often important (and difficult to degrade) environmental pollutants, reductive dechlorination is an important process in bioremediation.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemolithotrophy is a type of metabolism where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.  Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also autotrophic.  There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).\\r\\n\\r\\nMany organisms are capable of using hydrogen (H2) as a source of energy.  While several mechanisms of anaerobic hydrogen oxidation have been mentioned previously (e.g. sulfate reducing- and acetogenic bacteria), hydrogen can also be used as an energy source aerobically in the knallgas reaction:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these organisms, hydrogen is oxidized by a membrane-bound hydrogenase causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and cytochromes.  In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic hydrogenase is used to generate reducing power in the form of NADH, which is subsequently used to fix carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.  Hydrogen-oxidizing organisms, such as Cupriavidus necator (formerly Ralstonia eutropha), often inhabit oxic-anoxic interfaces in nature to take advantage of the hydrogen produced by anaerobic fermentative organisms while still maintaining a supply of oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide H2S), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate (S2O2?3) to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4).  A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is Beggiatoa, a microbe originally described by Sergei Winogradsky, one of the founders of environmental microbiology. Another example is Paracoccus. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed.  This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane.  Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using reverse electron flow, an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their thermodynamic gradient to produce NADH.  Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite (SO2?3) and subsequently converted to sulfate (SO2?4) by the enzyme sulfite oxidase.[7]  Some organisms, however, accomplish the same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-reducing bacteria (see above).  In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production.[7]  In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. Thiobacillus denitrificans) use nitrate (NO?3) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerrous iron is a soluble form of iron that is stable at extremely low pHs or under anaerobic conditions.  Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric (Fe3+) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3).  There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes.  The first are acidophiles, such as the bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, as well as the archaeon Ferroplasma.  These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in acid mine drainage.  The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example Gallionella ferruginea, Leptothrix ochracea, or Mariprofundus ferrooxydans) live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are  microaerophiles.  The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas,[8] which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.  Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme rusticyanin to facilitate the formation of proton motive force.  Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrification is the process by which ammonia (NH3) is converted to nitrate (NO?3).  Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (NO?2) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. Nitrosomonas) and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Nitrobacter).  Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms.  Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase in the cytoplasm, followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase in the periplasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectron and proton cycling are very complex but as a net result only one proton is translocated across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.  Nitrite oxidation is much simpler, with nitrite being oxidized by the enzyme nitrite oxidoreductase coupled to proton translocation by a very short electron transport chain, again leading to very low growth rates for these organisms.  Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes.  As in sulfur and iron oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated by reverse electron flow, thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an already energy-poor process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, two groups independently showed the microbial genus Nitrospira is capable of complete nitrification (Comammox).[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnammox stands for anaerobic ammonia oxidation and the organisms responsible were relatively recently discovered, in the late 1990s.[11]  This form of metabolism occurs in members of the Planctomycetes (e.g. Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans) and involves the coupling of ammonia oxidation to nitrite reduction.  As oxygen is not required for this process, these organisms are strict anaerobes.  Amazingly, hydrazine (N2H4 ÿ rocket fuel) is produced as an intermediate during anammox metabolism.  To deal with the high toxicity of hydrazine, anammox bacteria contain a hydrazine-containing intracellular organelle called the anammoxasome, surrounded by highly compact (and unusual) ladderane lipid membrane.  These lipids are unique in nature, as is the use of hydrazine as a metabolic intermediate.  Anammox organisms are autotrophs although the mechanism for carbon dioxide fixation is unclear.  Because of this property, these organisms could be used to remove nitrogen in industrial wastewater treatment processes.[12]  Anammox has also been shown have widespread occurrence in anaerobic aquatic systems and has been speculated to account for approximately 50% of nitrogen gas production in the ocean.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany microbes (phototrophs) are capable of using light as a source of energy to produce ATP and organic compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.  Of these, algae are particularly significant because they are oxygenic, using water as an electron donor for electron transfer during photosynthesis.[14]  Phototrophic bacteria are found in the phyla Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes.[15] Along with plants these microbes are responsible for all biological generation of oxygen gas on Earth. Because chloroplasts were derived from a lineage of the Cyanobacteria, the general principles of metabolism in these endosymbionts can also be applied to chloroplasts.[16] In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis, many bacteria can also photosynthesize anaerobically, typically using sulfide (H2S) as an electron donor to produce sulfate.  Inorganic sulfur (S0), thiosulfate (S2O2?3) and ferrous iron (Fe2+) can also be used by some organisms.  Phylogenetically, all oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), Green sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chlorobium), Green non-sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus), or the heliobacteria (Low %G+C Gram positives).  In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon Halobacterium or the bacterium Roseobacter, among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out photosynthesis.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs befits the large diversity of photosynthetic bacteria, there are many different mechanisms by which light is converted into energy for metabolism.  All photosynthetic organisms locate their photosynthetic reaction centers  within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane (Proteobacteria), thylakoid membranes (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna structures called chlorosomes (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria).  Different photosynthetic bacteria also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as chlorophylls and carotenoids, allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum and thereby inhabit different niches.  Some groups of organisms contain more specialized light-harvesting structures (e.g. phycobilisomes in Cyanobacteria and chlorosomes in Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), allowing for increased efficiency in light utilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiochemically, anoxygenic photosynthesis is very different from oxygenic photosynthesis.  Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the Z scheme of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH.  Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool.  In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center.  A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool.  In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein ferredoxin, an energetically favorable reaction.  In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center.  In all cases, however, a proton motive force is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost photosynthetic microbes are autotrophic, fixing carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.  Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are photoheterotrophs, meaning that they use organic carbon compounds as a carbon source for growth.  Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrogen is an element required for growth by all biological systems.  While extremely common (80% by volume) in the atmosphere, dinitrogen gas (N2) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high activation energy.  Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia (NH3), which is easily assimilated by all organisms.[17]  These prokaryotes, therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential for the survival of entire ecosystems.  This is especially true in the ocean, where nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of fixed nitrogen, and in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between legumes and their nitrogen-fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrogen fixation can be found distributed throughout nearly all bacterial lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property.  Because the enzyme nitrogenase, responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low.  Examples include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both because nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically expensive process (16ÿ24 ATP are used per N2 fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the nitrogenase to oxygen.","input":"What nutrient is the main source of energy for microorganisms?"},{"output":"London's West End","context":"The Phantom of the Opera is an operetta with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe. Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe also wrote the operetta's book together.[1] Based on the French novel Le Fant?me de l'Opra by Gaston Leroux, its central plot revolves around a beautiful soprano, Christine Daa, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Opera Populaire.[2]\\r\\nThe musical opened in London's West End in 1986, and on Broadway in 1988. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, and Michael Crawford (in the title role) won the Olivier and Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Musical.[3] It is the longest running show in Broadway history by a wide margin, and celebrated its 10,000th Broadway performance on 11 February 2012, the first production ever to do so.[4] It is the second longest-running West End musical, after Les Misrables, and the third longest-running West End show overall, after The Mousetrap.[5][6][7]\\r\\nWith total estimated worldwide gross receipts of over $5.6?billion and total Broadway gross of $845?million,[8] Phantom was the most financially successful entertainment event until The Lion King surpassed it in 2014.[9][10][11] By 2011, it had been seen by over 130 million people in 145 cities across 27 countries, and continues to play in London and New York.[9]\\r\\nIn 1984, Lloyd Webber contacted Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, to propose a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw an effective way to make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: \\"I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!\\"[12]\\r\\nLloyd Webber first approached Jim Steinman to write the lyrics because of his \\"dark obsessive side\\", but he declined in order to fulfill his commitments on a Bonnie Tyler album.[13] Alan Jay Lerner was then recruited, but he became seriously ill after joining the project and was forced to withdraw; none of his contributions (mostly involving the song \\"Masquerade\\") are credited in the show.[14][15] Richard Stilgoe, the lyricist for Starlight Express, wrote most of the original lyrics for the production. Charles Hart, a young and then-relatively unknown lyricist, later rewrote many of the lyrics, along with original lyrics for \\"Think of Me\\". Some of Stilgoe's original contributions are still present in the final version, however.[16]\\r\\nInspired in part by an earlier musical version of the same story by Ken Hill,[17] Lloyd Webber's score is sometimes operatic in style but maintains the form and structure of a musical throughout. The full-fledged operatic passages are reserved principally for subsidiary characters such as Andre and Firmin, Carlotta, and Piangi. They are also used to provide the content of the fictional \\"operas\\" that are taking place within the show itself, viz., Hannibal, Il Muto, and the Phantom's masterwork, Don Juan Triumphant. \\"Here, Lloyd Webber pastiched various styles from the grand operas of Meyerbeer through to Mozart and even Gilbert and Sullivan.\\"[18] These pieces are often presented as musical fragments, interrupted by dialogue or action sequences in order to clearly define the musical's \\"show within a show\\" format. The musical extracts from the Phantom's opera, \\"Don Juan Triumphant\\", during the latter stages of the show, are dissonant and modern\\"suggesting, perhaps, that the Phantom is ahead of his time artistically\\".[19]\\r\\nMaria Bj?rnson designed the sets and over 200 costumes, including the elaborate gowns in the \\"Masquerade\\" sequence. Her set designs, including the chandelier, subterranean gondola, and sweeping staircase, earned her multiple awards.[20][21] Hal Prince, director of Cabaret, Candide, Follies, and Lloyd Webber's Evita, directed the production, while Gillian Lynne, associate director and choreographer of Cats, provided the integral musical staging and choreography.\\r\\nA preview of the first act was staged at Sydmonton (Lloyd Webber's home) in 1985, starring Colm Wilkinson (later the star of the Toronto production) as the Phantom, Sarah Brightman as Kristin (later Christine), and Clive Carter (later a member of the London cast) as Raoul. This very preliminary production used Richard Stilgoe's original unaltered lyrics, and many songs sported names that were later changed, such as \\"What Has Time Done to Me\\" (\\"Think of Me\\"), and \\"Papers\\" (\\"Notes\\"). The Phantom's original mask covered the entire face and remained in place throughout the performance, obscuring the actor's vision and muffling his voice. Bj?rnson designed the now-iconic half-mask to replace it, and the unmasking sequence was added.[16] Clips of this preview performance were included on the DVD of the 2004 film production.[22]\\r\\nPhantom began previews at Her Majesty's Theatre in London's West End on 27 September 1986 under the direction of Hal Prince, then opened on 9 October. It was choreographed by Gillian Lynne and the sets were designed by Maria Bj?rnson, with lighting by Andrew Bridge.[23] Michael Crawford starred in the title role with Sarah Brightman as Christine and Steve Barton as Raoul. The production, still playing at Her Majesty's, celebrated its 10,000th performance on 23 October 2010, with Lloyd Webber and the original Phantom, Michael Crawford, in attendance. It is the second longest-running musical in West End (and world) history behind Les Misrables, and third overall behind The Mousetrap.[24][25]\\r\\nA 25th-anniversary stage performance was held in London on 1 and 2 October 2011 at the Royal Albert Hall and was screened live in cinemas worldwide.[26] The production was produced by Cameron Mackintosh, directed by Laurence Connor, musical staging & choreography by Gillian Lynne, set design by Matt Kinley, costume design by Maria Bj?rnson, lighting design by Patrick Woodroffe, and sound design by Mick Potter. The cast included Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom, Sierra Boggess as Christine, Hadley Fraser as Raoul, Wynne Evans as Piangi, Wendy Ferguson as Carlotta, Barry James as Monsieur Firmin, Gareth Snook as Monsieur Andre, Liz Robertson as Madame Giry, and Daisy Maywood as Meg Giry. Lloyd Webber and several original cast members, including Crawford and Brightman, were in attendance. A DVD and Blu-ray of the performance was released in February 2012,[27] and it began airing in March 2012 on PBS's \\"Great Performances\\" television series.[26]\\r\\nIn March 2012, a new production directed by Laurence Connor began a UK and Ireland tour to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the show, beginning at the Theatre Royal Plymouth and travelled to Manchester, Bristol, Dublin, Leeds, Edinburgh, Milton Keynes, Cardiff, and Southampton. John Owen-Jones and Earl Carpenter alternated as the Phantom with Katie Hall and Olivia Brereton as Christine and Simon Bailey as Raoul.[28]\\r\\nPhantom began Broadway previews at the Majestic Theatre on 9 January 1988 and opened on 26 January.[10][29] Crawford, Brightman, and Barton reprised their respective roles from the West End. The production continues to play at the Majestic, where it became the first Broadway musical in history to surpass 10,000 performances on 11 February 2012.[30] On 26 January 2013, the production celebrated its 25th anniversary with its 10,400th performance.[31] It is, by over 3,500 performances, the longest-running show in Broadway history.[23] By November 2016, Phantom had been staged over 12,000 times over 28 years.[32]\\r\\nIn 2013, the rights to perform \\"Phantom\\" were released to non-professional groups.[33] CLOC musical theatre staged the world amateur premiere in May 2013 at the National Theatre in Melbourne, Australia. In June 2013, Windmill Theatre Company staged the production at the Drum Theatre in Dandenong. Also in June 2013, Wellington Musical Theatre debuted the New Zealand premiere starring Chris Crowe and Barbara Graham.\\r\\nIn 1905 Paris, the Opra Populaire hosts an auction of old theatrical props. Among the attendees is the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who purchases a papier-mach music box and eyes it sadly, remarking how the details are \\"exactly as she said.\\"[34][35] The auctioneer presents \\"a chandelier in pieces\\" as the next item up for bid, alluding to a connection with \\"the Phantom of the Opera\\". As the porters remove the drop cloth covering the fixture, it flickers to life and ascends to the ceiling as the auditorium's former grandeur is restored (\\"Overture\\").\\r\\nIt is now 1881[36] and the cast of a new production, Hannibal, are rehearsing onstage when they learn that new owners, Firmin and Andr, are taking over the Opra Populaire. Carlotta, the Opra's resident soprano prima donna, begins to perform an aria for the new managers when a backdrop inexplicably falls from the flies, barely missing her and prompting anxious chorus girls to whisper, \\"He's here! The Phantom of the Opera!\\". The managers try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily insists that such things happen all the time and she storms out. Madame Giry, the Opra's ballet mistress, informs Firmin and Andr that Christine Daa, a chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist, has been \\"well taught\\" and can sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the sold out show being their only other alternative, the managers reluctantly audition Christine and are surprised to discover that she is indeed up to the challenge. As Christine sings the aria during the evening performance, the Opra's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, recognizes her as his childhood friend and playmate (\\"Think of Me\\").\\r\\nBackstage after her triumphant dbut, Christine confesses to her best friend Meg (Madame Giry's daughter) that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible \\"Angel of Music\\" (\\"Angel of Music\\"). Raoul pays a visit to Christine's dressing room. The two reminisce about the \\"Angel of Music\\" stories that her late father used to tell them and Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing (\\"Little Lotte\\"). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom's voice and she entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing as a ghostly, partially masked face in her mirror (\\"The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)\\"). Believing him to be the Angel of Music sent by her deceased father, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the cellars of the Opra house. The two then board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair (\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her. When he reveals a mirror that reflects an image of her in a wedding dress, the figure in the mirror gestures to Christine and she faints. The Phantom then covers her tenderly with his cloak (\\"The Music of the Night\\").\\r\\nAs the Phantom is composing music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box (\\"I Remember\\"). Overcome with curiosity, she slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his grotesquely disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying gesture, as Christine hides in fear. He then ruefully expresses his longing to look normal, and to be loved by her (\\"Stranger Than You Dreamt It\\"). Moved by pity, Christine returns the Phantom's mask to him and the Phantom shepherds her back above ground.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Joseph Buquet, the Opra's chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the \\"Opra Ghost\\" and his terrible Punjab lasso (\\"Magical Lasso\\"). Madame Giry arrives and warns Buquet to exercise restraint or face the Phantom's wrath. In the managers' office, Andr and Firman read notes from the Phantom aloud and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Carlotta and Piangi then burst into the office, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note saying that her days at the Opera Populaire are numbered. As Andr and Firmin try to calm the distressed Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta in the new opera, Il Muto, lest they face a \\"disaster beyond imagination\\" (\\"Notes...\\"). Firmin and Andr dismiss the threat and assure an enraged Carlotta that she will remain their star (\\"Prima Donna\\").\\r\\nThe premire of Il Muto initially goes well, until the voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty for him. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a \\"little toad\\". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and Andr plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard throughout the auditorium (\\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\\").\\r\\nIn the ensuing chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof and tells him about her subterranean encounter with the Phantom (\\"Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There\\"). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and protect her, and Christine reciprocates his vow (\\"All I Ask of You\\"). The heartbroken Phantom, having overheard their entire conversation, angrily vows revenge before returning to the auditorium and brings down the chandelier, nearly killing Christine. (\\"All I Ask of You (Reprise)\\").\\r\\nSix months later, in the midst of a masquerade ball, the Phantom makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster, in costume as the Red Death. He announces that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant and demands that it be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and he warns of dire consequences if his demands are not met (\\"Masquerade/Why So Silent?\\"). Noticing an engagement ring on a chain around Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in a blinding flash of light. As the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a travelling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He has since taken refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home.\\r\\nDuring rehearsals, Raoul ÿ tired of the tyranny with which the Phantom rules the Opera ÿ thinks to use the premire of Don Juan Triumphant as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind and that it is her plan so she can be the star. Christine angrily defends herself, saying she is not the Phantom's accomplice, but his victim. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fiance, asserts that the Phantom will be sure to attend the opera's premire, and begs Christine to help him lure the Phantom into the trap (\\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\\"). Torn between her love for Raoul and her fear of the Phantom, Christine visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance but understanding that she must move on (\\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\"). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum, again under the guise of the Angel of Music (\\"Wandering Child\\"), and sings to Christine. Christine, tired and heartbroken, once again accepts her \\"Angel\\" as a friend, nearly succumbing to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to both rescue her and confront The Phantom. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fire balls at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her (\\"Bravo Monsieur\\"). Furious, the Phantom declares war upon them both and causes flames to spring up around the mausoleum.\\r\\nWith armed policemen having secured the auditorium and watching for the Phantom, Don Juan Triumphant premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that she is singing not with Piangi, but with the Phantom himself (\\"The Point of No Return\\"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses love for Christine and forces his ring onto her finger; Christine rips off his mask, exposing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. The opera house is plunged into chaos. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage, the cast and audience fly into a state of panic, and the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, searches the theatre for the Phantom, while Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair, and warns him to beware his magical lasso.(\\"Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer\\").\\r\\nIn the lair, Christine is forced to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show compassion. The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The Phantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him forever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion for the first time in his life. The Phantom, having experienced kindness at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him, and sets them both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom tells Christine he loves her, before she tearfully exits with Raoul. The weeping Phantom huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cloak. The mob, led by Meg, enters the lair. Meg pulls the Phantom's cloak from the throne, finding only his mask on the seat. She lifts the mask up into the light and gazes at in wonder as the curtain falls.[37]\\r\\nThe original casts of the major productions of The Phantom of the Opera:[38][39]\\r\\n? The role of Christine Daa is double-cast in most professional productions. The secondary actress performs the role twice a week (on Broadway, Thursday evening and Saturday matine).[41]\\r\\n? Three roles (The Phantom, Christine, and Carlotta) were double-cast in the original Las Vegas production, with the two actors in each pair singing alternate performances.[42] Later, Las Vegas casting became identical to that in the Broadway production, with single casting for all characters except Christine.[43]\\r\\nThere are several orchestrations:\\r\\nThe current Broadway orchestration is what is licensed by R&H Theatricals for amateur and professional productions. The only difference between the 29- and 27-piece orchestras is the lack of Violins VII & VIII in the 27-piece orchestra.\\r\\nThe Broadway production originally used a 29-piece pit orchestra:\\r\\nPercussion is split between two books ÿ regular percussion and mallets\\r\\nCast recordings have been made of the London,[44] Austrian,[45] Dutch, German, Japanese, Swedish, Korean, Hungarian, Mexican, Polish, Russian and Canadian productions.[46]\\r\\nThe recording of the 1986 original London cast, released by Polydor Records in 1987, was released in both a single CD Highlights From The Phantom of the Opera and a two CD Phantom of the Opera, both of which have been certified 4G Platinum in the US and sold 4.97?million copies as of January 2017. \\"The Complete Recordings\\" edition has sold 507,000 copies since 1991.[47][48] Phantom was also certified 3G Platinum in the UK.[49] The Canadian cast recording went 2G Platinum in Canada.[50] In Switzerland, Phantom was certified 3G Platinum and Highlights was certified 2G Platinum.[51] Recordings of the Vienna cast and the Hamburg cast produced by Jimmy Bowien were certified Gold and triple Platinum, respectively, in Germany.[52] The original album recording has sold an alleged 24 million copies worldwide.[53]\\r\\nA live recording of The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall was released in the UK on 15 November 2011 and subsequently in the US and Canada on 7 February 2012,[54] along with Blu-ray and DVD videos, and a collectors' box set of the Royal Albert concert, the original cast recording, and the sequel, Love Never Dies.[54][55]\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nIn 1987 the heirs of Giacomo Puccini charged in a lawsuit that the climactic phrase in \\"Music of the Night\\" closely resembled a similar phrase in the sequence \\"Quello che tacete\\" from Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West.[71][72] The litigation was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.[73][74]\\r\\nIn 1990 a Baltimore songwriter named Ray Repp filed a lawsuit alleging that the title song from Phantom was based on a song that he wrote in 1978 called \\"Till You\\".[75] After eight years of litigation ÿ including an unsuccessful countersuit by Lloyd Webber claiming that \\"Till You\\" was itself a plagiarism of \\"Close Every Door\\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat[76] ÿ the jury found in Lloyd Webber's favour.[77]\\r\\nFormer Pink Floyd vocalist Roger Waters has repeatedly claimed in interviews that the signature descending/ascending half-tone chord progression from Phantom's title song was plagiarised from the bass line of a track on the 1971 Pink Floyd album Meddle called \\"Echoes\\".

With only the exception of Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, New Zealand, Panama, Poland, Romania, and the 25th Anniversary UK and US Tours, these productions have all been \\"clones\\", using the original staging, direction, sets, and costume concepts.[79][80] Notable international productions include the following:\\r\\nA film version, directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Gerard Butler as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine, Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Minnie Driver as Carlotta, and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, opened on 22 December 2004 in the US.[100]\\r\\nAn edited production renamed Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular opened 24 June 2006 at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a theatre built specifically for the show to resemble the Opra Garnier in Paris.[101] The production ran 95 minutes with no intermission, and was directed and choreographed by Harold Prince and Gillian Lynne, with scenic designs by David Rockwell. The show featured updated technology and effects, including a re-engineered chandelier capable of reassembling in midair during the overture while the entire interior of the venue (not merely the stage) returned to its 1880s halcyon days.[42] Almost 45 minutes' worth of material was eliminated, such as the Don Juan Triumphant rehearsal. \\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\\" and \\"The Point of No Return\\" were significantly shortened.[42] Other changes resembled those in the 2004 film, such as staging the chandelier crash at the plot's climax (during performance of \\"The Point of No Return\\") rather than mid-story.[43][102] The Las Vegas production closed on 2 September 2012.\\r\\nIn 2011 The Really Useful Group (copyright owners of Phantom) released certain rights to the play in celebration of its 25th anniversary. In March 2011 Reed-Custer High School in Braidwood, Illinois, became the first school to perform Phantom under the new rights.[103] Later in 2011, Stanwell School in Penarth became the first school in the UK to perform the show.[104]\\r\\nThe sequel to Phantom, written by Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton, Frederick Forsyth and Glenn Slater, is called Love Never Dies.[108] It was loosely adapted from the 1999 novel The Phantom of Manhattan, by Forsyth. Set in 1907 (a decade after the conclusion of Phantom according to the production's announcement,[109] but actually 26 years later, as the original show was set in 1881[36]), Christine is invited to perform at Phantasma, a new attraction at Coney Island, by an anonymous impresario. With her husband, Raoul, and son, Gustave, in tow she journeys to Brooklyn, unaware that it is the Phantom who has arranged her appearance at the popular beach resort.[109][110]\\r\\nThe original production was directed by Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with set and costume designs by Bob Crowley,[108] and opened at the Adelphi Theatre in the West End on 9 March 2010.[111] Though it ran for over 17 months and closed on 27 August 2011, the production received mixed reviews.[112][113][114] A scheduled Broadway opening in November 2010 was postponed until Spring 2011[115] and later cancelled.[116] A revamped Australian production, starring Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne, opened 21 May 2011 at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne to more favourable notices.[117][118][119][120] After the Melbourne run ended on 12 December 2011 the production moved to the Capitol Theatre in Sydney where it played from January to April 2012.[121][122]","input":"Where was phantom of the opera first performed?"},{"output":"United States","context":"","input":"Who were involved in the american civil war?"},{"output":"20,000 years in the past","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlpha is a 2018 American historical adventure film directed by Albert Hughes and written by Daniele Sebastian Wiedenhaupt, from a story by Hughes.

Tau, its chief, trains his adolescent son Keda, accepting him and another boy to join the hunting party. His wife Rho worries that Keda is not ready, but Tau believes he is and the hunters set out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTau tests Keda by having him kill a boar they've caught, but Keda balks. One night, the party's fire draws the attention of a Machairodus, which lunges through their circle, snatching Keda's friend. Hearing the fatal struggle in the darkness, the tribe gives him up for dead. The member is given a memorial service in the form of placing rocks to symbolize the passing of one's spirit to the afterlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hunters eventually reach a herd of steppe bison, which they attempt to stampede off a cliff in relative success. Amidst the chaos, a bison rushes Keda and throws him over the edge, leaving him gripping the rough cliff edge with his hand. Keda loses grip and falls to a further ledge where he appears to break his leg and is knocked to unconsciousness. Tau attempts to climb down to him, but he is stopped by another member of the tribe who assures him in good faith that Keda is dead and there would be no way to reach him nonetheless. The tribe leaves and Tau performs another funeral ritual, stricken with grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeda awakes and tries to climb the rest of the way down the cliff. A sudden heavy rainfall causes the ravine below to flood. Losing his grip, Keda jumps into the water. He survives and splints his injured foot before returning to the top of the cliff. Seeing the memorial cairn left by his tribe, he realizes he must trek back to the village by himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is attacked by a pack of wolves, but escapes up a tree, wounding one of them which the others leave behind. Keda takes pity on it and cares for its injury. Gradually gaining the wolf's trust, he gives it water and then food, establishing himself as dominant by feeding himself first. He sets out for the village without the wolf, but it follows him. Their companionship grows, and they learn to hunt small boar together. Along the way, Keda names the wolf Alpha.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, they are approached menacingly by a pack of wolves. They hesitate upon seeing Alpha, who steps forward and greets them. The pack runs off and with Keda's blessing, Alpha joins them.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeda continues his journey alone as the season changes to winter. On a frozen lake, he encounters a pack of wolves feeding. Recognizing Alpha, he runs to them, but the ice breaks and he falls through. Alpha helps rescue him and they are reunited.\\r\\n\\r\\nContinuing the journey together, they find a man who has frozen to death outside his tent and scavenge a bow and arrow from it. Later, they take refuge from cave hyenas in a cave where they are attacked by another Machairodus. Alpha and the Machairodus fight, and Keda kills the Machairodus with the arrow. However, Alpha is badly injured and now travels with difficulty. Meanwhile, Keda begins to cough up blood. When Alpha finally cannot walk, Keda carries the wolf.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeda eventually finds the village and reunites happily with his parents, who are amazed and proud of him. As the village healer tends to Alpha's wounds, the wolf delivers a litter of pups to Keda's surprise.

The film uses the IMAX 3D format.[7] Kodi Smit-McPhee was confirmed as its star in November 2015,[8] and other casting was finalized the following February.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming took place in Drumheller, Burnaby, and Vancouver,[10] where a large set was built in Boundary Road near East Kent Avenue. Filming in Vancouver took place from February to May 2016, and at Dinosaur Provincial Park near Patricia, Alberta in April 2016,[11] and in Iceland.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production was investigated after five Alberta bison were allegedly killed in the making of the film.[13] Following an investigation, the American Humane Association denied its \\"No Animals Were Harmed\\" end-credit certification to the production.[14] Two days before the film's release, PETA called for a boycott of the film.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2017, the film's title was changed from The Solutrean to Alpha. The term Solutrean is derived from Solutr. Initially set for a September 2017 release date, it was pushed back to March 2018.[16] In December 2017, it was again delayed, this time to September 2018.[17] In April 2018, the release date was moved up to August 17, 2018.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  September?25, 2018[update], Alpha has grossed $35.3?million in the United States and Canada, and $55.4?million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $90.7?million, against a production budget of $51?million.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States and Canada, Alpha was released alongside Crazy Rich Asians and Mile 22, and was projected to gross $7ÿ9?million from 2,719 theaters in its opening weekend.[19] It made $3.4?million on its first day, including $525,000 from Thursday night previews at 2,303 theaters. It went on to debut to $10.3?million, finishing fifth at the box office.[20] In its second weekend the film dropped to seventh place, making $5.6?million.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Well-acted and beautifully filmed, Alpha offers a canine-assisted epic adventure that blends rousing action with an extra helping of canine charm.\\"[22] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[23] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale.[20]","input":"What year does the movie alpha take place?"},{"output":"68 men's","context":"The selection process for college basketball's NCAA Division I Men's and Women's Basketball Championships determines which teams (68 men's, 64 women's) will enter the tournaments (the centerpieces of the basketball championship frenzy known as \\"March Madness\\") and their seedings and matchups in the knockout bracket. Thirty-two teams gain automatic entry through winning their conference's championship. The remaining teams (36 men's, 32 women's) rely on the selection committee to award them an at-large bid in the tournament. The selection process primarily takes place on Selection Sunday and the days leading up to it. Selection Sunday is also when the men's brackets and seeds are released to the public. The women's championship brackets and seeds are announced one day later, on Selection Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ten-member basketball selection committee is made up of athletic directors and conference commissioners throughout Division I men's and women's athletics with separate committees for the men's and women's tournaments. The committees, whose members serve five-year terms, are chosen to ensure that conferences from around the country are represented. Historically the men's selection committee consisted of all men, and the women's selection committee consisted of all women. However, recently women have been serving on the mens committee (including Judy Rose, Lynn Hickey, and current member Janet Cone), and men have been serving on the womens committee (including Richard Ensor and current member Jeff Konya). The tournament selection is only part of the committee members' duties; the panels meet year-round (in-person or through conference calls) to discuss the tournament and its administration, evaluate teams, assign tournament game officials, and determine future tournament sites.\\r\\nTo avoid potential conflicts of interest, committee members must leave the room when his or her own school is being discussed (or schools in the case of the conference commissioners). The member may be invited to answer factual questions regarding his or her team or teams (e.g., status of player injuries). An athletic director may be present when other schools from his or her conference are discussed, but he or she may only speak if asked.\\r\\n?2017-18 chairman\\r\\n?2017-18 vice-chairman\\r\\n?2017-18 chairperson\\r\\nThe selection committee must first decide which teams will compete in the tournament. As of the 2016ÿ17 season, thirty-two teams receive automatic bids to the tournament by winning their conference tournament.[1]\\r\\nThe selection committee only selects the teams (36 for men and 32 for women) who receive at-large bids. Though each conference receives only one automatic bid, the selection committee may select any number of at-large teams from each conference. The at-large teams generally come from college basketball's top conferences, including the ACC, The American, A-10, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, Mountain West, Pac-12, and SEC. Many of these at-large teams, however, are \\"on the bubble\\", meaning that their chances of gaining a tournament berth are borderline, and they will not know if they have gained entry until the Selection Sunday bracket announcements.\\r\\nThe RPI rating is often considered a factor in selecting and seeding the final few teams in the tournament field. However, the NCAA selection committee in 2015 said the RPI is only utilized for grouping the teams into groups such as top 50 and top 100 teams, to value the wins and losses, and not as a factor for selection.[2] Additionally, the committee officially considers predictive computer rankings, such as ESPN's BPI, Sagarin, and Pomeroy Ratings, which use additional factors considered by the committee, such as injured players in the case of the BPI. Additionally, committee members consider how teams do on the road and at neutral courts, strength of conference and schedule, non-conference strength of schedule, record against other selected tournament teams, and other extenuating factors. Finally, the \\"eye test\\" is often quoted by pundits as something the committee uses, however ncaa.org's sparse description of the selection process doesn't officially mention the \\"eye test\\".[3] For instance, in 2016 Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione, the NCAA selection committee's chair, said that the stark contrast in Syracuse's performance in 2015-2016 with Jim Boeheim present versus absent was considered the same as missing a key player during the slump.[4]\\r\\nA number of teams essentially know that they are assured of an at-large berth no matter their performance in their conference tournament. Most teams in the Top 25 in the national polls or RPI are essentially guaranteed at-large berths even if they do not win their respective conference tournaments. However, teams that have been ranked heading into Selection Sunday but didn't win a weaker conference's tournament have been essentially penalized (or \\"snubbed\\") by the selection committee despite computer rankings or public opinion. One example was Utah State in 2004, when Utah State completed the regular season with a record of 25-2 but was snubbed after losing in their conference tournament, even though they were ranked in the polls.[5] The factors in their snub were the soft non-conference schedule which included Mountain West Conference foes BYU (close home win) and Utah (road loss) as well as the road loss to Pacific on February 14, 2004. Pacific went on to earn the Big West Conference's automatic berth and advanced to the 2nd round of the 2004 tournament.[6]\\r\\nThe committee also selects four additional teams, the \\"First Four Out,\\" who do not qualify for the tournament. Since 2015, the NCAA has placed the \\"First Four Out\\" as the top seeds in the National Invitation Tournament.[7]\\r\\nWhile the selection committee assembles to do the official work, many predictions are made by various people and organizations. Speculations and buzz can come from anywhere from random college basketball fans to senior bracketologists and experts on the selection process and the seedings, such as ESPN's Joe Lunardi. Other well-known experts in this field include Ken Pomeroy of kenpom.com, Jerry Palm of CBSSports.com, Gary Parrish of CBSSports.com, and Dean Oliver of ESPN's BPI. The ESPN's BPI also considers injured key players, which is also considered by the NCAA selection committee.\\r\\nBracketology is conducted extensively for the men's tournament, although a few bracketologists also make projected brackets for the women's tournament, the most prominent being Charlie Creme's weekly projections on ESPN.com.\\r\\nThe selection committee's work to seed the teams is just as vital as their work to select the at-large teams. While the selection process starts before the seeding process, the two often overlap. Some conference tournaments do not finish until Selection Sunday itself, and there is only one hour between the end of the last game (usually the Big Ten Tournament championship game) and when the brackets are officially unveiled, so the committee cannot wait until after all the games are played to start determining the seeds. While nothing is set in stone until after all the games are played and the brackets are established, the committee may have a good idea of where a team is and where they could rise or fall to depending on their showing in the later stages of their conference tournament. The women's tournament has the luxury of an extra day from the end of the games on Sunday to prepare its bracket announcements on Monday.\\r\\nThe selection committee uses a number of factors to place teams on the S-curve, including record, strength of schedule, and the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI). Relative subjective comparison of individual teams close on the S-Curve are also considered. Though the brackets only feature the seed numbers 1-16 in each region, the committee assembles an S-curve of teams seeded from 1 through 68. In theory, the teams 1-4 on the seed list will all be #1 seeds (the #1 \\"seed line\\"), 5-8 will be #2 seeds (the #2 seed line), and so on; however, bracketing rules often lead to some deviation from this. The S-curve is most important for keeping each region balanced, the ideal being that each region will be equally strong. For example, the committee will try to ensure that the number 1 team on the seed list, the national #1 seed, will be in the same region as the weakest #2 seed. The committee tries to ensure that the top four seeds in each region are comparable to the top four teams in every other region. For example, if one region has the best #1 seed (#1 overall), the weakest #2 seed (#8 overall), the best #3 seed (#9 overall), and the weakest #4 seed (#16 overall), its seeds add up to 34, the ideal number. But if a region has the best team for every given seed, its seeds would add up to 28, and a region with the weakest team in every seed would add up to 40, making the two regions very unbalanced. It is extremely unusual that an at-large bid can be lower than a #12 seed, but it has occurred, most recently with BYU and Iona being #14 seeds in the 2012 Tournament. While the seeds are almost never perfectly balanced throughout the four regions, the committee strives to ensure that they differ from each other by only a few points. The process is identical for the women's tournament, with the exception that seeding occurs to 64.\\r\\nOnce the S-curve is established, the committee must place the teams throughout the four regions. They were originally referred to as East, Mideast, Midwest, and West. In 1985, the Mideast designation became the Southeast, and later the South Regional in 1998. The women's tournament continued to use the Mideast terminology through 2004. In 2004, the NCAA started to identify the men's regions only by the city in which the regional semifinals and finals were played, with the same change being made for the women's tournament in 2005. The NCAA reverted to the East/South/Midwest/West designations for the men's tournament starting in 2007, but continues to designate women's regionals by their cities. Typically the cities selected will be spread throughout the country and conform roughly to the old geographic distinctions. While the regions are named for certain cities, the first and second round games are played in different cities which need not be anywhere near the regional finals. In 2005 the Austin, Texas men's regional was fed by games in Indianapolis, Indiana; Tucson, Arizona; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Worcester, Massachusetts. This is due to the \\"pod\\" system enacted before the 2002 tournament to minimize travel for as many teams as possible, especially in the early rounds. Any team may be sent to any region and any pod, although the tournament does try to keep teams, especially the top-seeded teams, closer to home. However, in 2004, Pittsburgh played its first two tournament games in Milwaukee and not in Buffalo or Columbus, cities to which it was closer. This was done to keep a lower-seeded team, the Wisconsin Badgers, close to its campus. Similarly, two east-coast teams, Maryland and Syracuse, traveled to Denver, where their opening round opponents were BYU and UTEP, both of which were geographically closer to Denver. In addition, in 2009, Kansas and West Virginia, the two higher seeds, traveled to Minneapolis to play their opponents North Dakota State and Dayton, although Dayton and North Dakota State are geographically closer to Minneapolis than Kansas and West Virginia. To make matters worse for both latter teams, Kansas City (Kansas) and Greensboro NC (West Virginia) were both 1st-2nd round sites that year.\\r\\nA number of complex rules govern the seeding process, so it is not as simple as merely following the S-curve, although that is the top priority according to the NCAA's rules.[8] Better teams have priority in remaining close to home, but no hosting institution's team can actually play at the location where the institution is hosting tournament games (generally, games are hosted on neutral courts, so this is not usually a problem). Sometimes a top team may be a short drive away from its games; in 2006 Villanova played its first and second round games in Philadelphia at an arena where they had played three games that year, one fewer than the four required for a site to be considered a \\"home court\\" for a team, and in 2002 the Pitt Panthers played their first and second round games in the city of Pittsburgh at Mellon Arena (which was not their home court after the opening of their on-campus arena). In the women's tournament, this criterion does not apply, and a team that is hosting is automatically assigned its home arena, regardless of seed. Thus, occasionally, lower seeded teams will host games. For example, in 2006 Old Dominion, although a 10th seed, played at its home court in the first round and also would have played there in the second round had the Lady Monarchs won that game. One major controversy during the 2014 that erupted was #1 seed South Carolina being forced to make two cross-country trips for the tournament, with many charging the Gamecocks were punished as a result of a home game ban by being forced to travel to Seattle for the first two rounds in a regional Washington was hosting, and Palo Alto where they were eliminated in the third round in the Stanford regional.[9] The following year, the NCAA allowed South Carolina to host its first two games, determining that since sites for the opening two rounds were (at least theoretically) determined on merit, those games were not covered by the NCAA's ban on holding its own championship events in that state (which has since been lifted).\\r\\nTeams are spread out according to conference. The first three teams selected from each conference must be placed in different regions (with a slight exception in 2014, when 11th seed play-in team Tennessee was placed in the Midwest Region with conference foe 8th seed Kentucky). When a conference has more than three teams in the tournament, the committee tries to seed the teams so that they cannot meet until the regional final. Before 2006, this was an absolute rule. However, in the summer of 2005, the NCAA changed its rules to allow intraconference matchups as early as the second round of the tournament, assuming that all measures to keep the teams apart until the regional finals have been exhausted. The NCAA was preparing for the chance that a conference would place more than eight teams in the tournament, which became a realistic possibility when the Big East, already a power conference, expanded to 16 members, with several of the new members having traditionally strong programs. The Big East placed a record eleven teams in the 2011 Tournament and nine teams in the 2012 Tournament. Although the Big East split into two leagues in 2013, the issue of conferences placing more than eight teams in the tournament remained, due to several other leagues expanding in the early 2010s (notably the ACC to 15, and the Big Ten and SEC to 14 each).\\r\\nThe committee may move a team up or down one seed from its seed line in the S-curve in order to preserve other principles. While this may be seen as unfair in some instances, the seeding process is an inexact science anyway, and a slight move in seeding is unlikely to significantly affect the chances of any team.\\r\\nThe committee also takes into consideration other non-basketball factors. In 2003 the tournament mistakenly placed BYU, a Latter-Day Saint school which has a policy of not playing games on Sunday, into a region where the team could be forced to play on a Sunday if they advanced to regional play. The NCAA then announced that they would switch BYU's region if they won their first two games and reached the regional semifinals; since BYU did not go that far, however, no action was taken.\\r\\nFor 2011, the region names were slightly adjusted based on the locations of the regionals. The Midwest and South regions were replaced with the Southeast and Southwest regions, held in New Orleans and San Antonio respectively (sites that were determined when the NCAA was using city names as regional names). The regions reverted to the previous ones in 2012.\\r\\nSelection Sunday is the day when the NCAA College basketball tournament participants are selected, placed, seeded accordingly, and announced. Both CBS and ESPN cover the selections for the men's tournament live; ESPN also covers selections for the women's tournament live on Selection Monday. The NCAA committee gathers to select and place 68 men's teams and 64 women's teams that secured or are deemed worthy of an invitation to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship and the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship basketball tournaments that take place in March and April. Selection Sunday is currently the Sunday before the third Thursday of March, when the first round games begin. Selection Monday is the next day.\\r\\nCBS has the official rights to cover the selection of the men's tournament field as they are the TV network which covers the vast majority of the tournament. (CBS held exclusive TV rights to the men's tournament from 1991 to 2010, and have shared rights with Turner Sports since 2011.) For this reason, CBS announces each bracket first, with ESPN passing on the brackets to its viewers seconds later. Both networks' coverage is augmented by discussion of the selections and predictions about how teams will fare once the tournament begins. ESPN has exclusive rights to cover the women's tournament selection announcements, as that network has sole rights to the women's tournament. Before 2006, the women's matchups were made in a selection show airing one hour before the men's matchups. However, beginning in 2006, the women's matchups have been announced by ESPN on Selection Monday. The Selection Monday move allows ESPN to provide more prominent coverage on women's basketball instead of providing minimal coverage for the women before devoting the rest of the evening to the men's tournament; it also allows minor coverage of the secondary National Invitation Tournament, to which ESPN also holds full rights.\\r\\nBoth CBS and ESPN send camera crews to schools around the nation to capture the teams' (and occasionally fans') reactions during the moment when they find out what seed they received or if they made the tournament at all. Once the teams are announced, the teams and their fans begin to make game plan and travel preparations. Additionally, millions of college basketball fans begin to fill in their brackets, usually as part of March Madness pools conducted through websites, gambling-related contests, or simply through a group of family members, friends, or co-workers.\\r\\nBeginning in 2018, and every other year thereafter, Turner Sports (through TBS) will air the Selection Special.[10]","input":"How many teams are selected for the ncaa tournament?"},{"output":"describes the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere","context":"The phosphorus cycle is the biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Unlike many other biogeochemical cycles, the atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movement of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus-based compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth. The production of phosphine gas occurs in only specialized, local conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the land, phosphorus gradually becomes less available to plants over thousands of years, because it is slowly lost in runoff. Low concentration of phosphorus in soils reduces plant growth, and slows soil microbial growth - as shown in studies of soil microbial biomass. Soil microorganisms act as both sinks and sources of available phosphorus in the biogeochemical cycle.[1] Locally, transformations of phosphorus are  chemical, biological and microbiological: the major long-term transfers in the global cycle, however, are driven by tectonic movements in geologic time.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans have caused major changes to the global phosphorus cycle through shipping of phosphorus minerals, and use of phosphorus fertilizer, and also the shipping of food from farms to cities, where it is lost as effluent.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants and animals. Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient for aquatic organisms. Phosphorus forms parts of important life-sustaining molecules that are very common in the biosphere. Phosphorus does not enter the atmosphere, remaining mostly on land and in rock and soil minerals. Eighty percent of the mined phosphorus is used to make fertilizers. Phosphates from fertilizers, sewage and detergents can cause pollution in lakes and streams. Overenrichment of phosphate in both fresh and inshore marine waters can lead to massive algae blooms which, when they die and decay, leads to eutrophication of fresh waters only. An example of this is the Canadian Experimental Lakes Area. These freshwater algal blooms should not be confused with those in saltwater environments. Recent research suggests that the predominant pollutant responsible for algal blooms in salt water estuaries and coastal marine habitats is Nitrogen.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhosphorus  occurs most abundantly in nature as part of the orthophosphate ion (PO4)3?, consisting of a P atom and 4 oxygen atoms. On land most phosphorus is found in rocks and minerals. Phosphorus rich deposits have generally formed in the ocean or from guano, and over time, geologic processes bring ocean sediments to land. Weathering of rocks and minerals release phosphorus in a soluble form where it is taken up by plants, and it is transformed into organic compounds.  The plants may then be consumed by herbivores and the phosphorus is either incorporated into their tissues or excreted. After death, the animal or plant decays, and phosphorus is returned to the soil where a large part of the phosphorus is transformed into insoluble compounds. Runoff may carry a small part of the phosphorus back to the ocean. Generally with time (thousands of years) soils become deficient in phosphorus leading to ecosystem retrogression.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary biological importance of phosphates is as a component of nucleotides, which \\r\\nserve as energy storage within cells (ATP) or when linked together, form the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. The double helix of our DNA is only possible because of the phosphate ester bridge that binds the helix. Besides making biomolecules, phosphorus is also found in bone and the enamel of mammalian teeth, whose strength is derived from calcium phosphate in the form of Hydroxylapatite.  It is also found in the exoskeleton of insects, and phospholipids (found in all biological membranes).[5]  It also functions as a buffering agent in maintaining acid base homeostasis in the human body.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhosphates move quickly through plants and animals; however, the processes that move them through the soil or ocean are very slow, making the phosphorus cycle overall one of the slowest biogeochemical cycles.[2][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, phosphate weathers from rocks and minerals, the most common mineral being apatite. Overall small losses occur in terrestrial environments by leaching and erosion, through the action of rain. In soil, phosphate is adsorbed on iron oxides, aluminium hydroxides, clay surfaces, and organic matter particles, and becomes incorporated (immobilized or fixed). Plants and fungi can also be active in making P soluble.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other cycles, P is not normally  found in the air as a gas; it only occurs under highly reducing conditions as the gas phosphine PH3.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe availability of phosphorus in an ecosystem is restricted by the rate of release of this element during weathering. The release of phosphorus from apatite dissolution is a key control on ecosystem productivity. The primary mineral with significant phosphorus content, apatite [Ca5(PO4)3OH] undergoes carbonation.[2][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle of this released phosphorus is taken up by biota (organic form), whereas a larger proportion reacts with other soil minerals.  This leads to precipitation into unavailable forms in the later stage of weathering and soil development. Available phosphorus is found in a biogeochemical cycle in the upper soil profile, while phosphorus found at lower depths is primarily involved in geochemical reactions with secondary minerals.  Plant growth depends on the rapid root uptake of phosphorus released from dead organic matter in the biochemical cycle. Phosphorus is limited in supply for plant growth. Phosphates move quickly through plants and animals; however, the processes that move them through the soil or ocean are very slow, making the phosphorus cycle overall one of the slowest biogeochemical cycles.[2][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLow-molecular-weight (LMW) organic acids are found in soils. They originate from the activities of various microorganisms in soils or may be exuded from the roots of living plants. Several of those organic acids are capable of forming stable organo-metal complexes with various metal ions found in soil solutions. As a result, these processes may lead to the release of inorganic phosphorus associated with aluminium, iron, and calcium in soil minerals. The production and release of oxalic acid by mycorrhizal fungi explain their importance in maintaining and supplying phosphorus to plants.[2][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe availability of organic phosphorus to support microbial, plant and animal growth depends on the rate of their degradation to generate free phosphate. There are various enzymes such as phosphatases, nucleases and phytase involved for the degradation. Some of the abiotic pathways in the environment studied are hydrolytic reactions and photolytic reactions. Enzymatic hydrolysis of organic phosphorus is an essential step in the biogeochemical phosphorus cycle, including the phosphorus nutrition of plants and microorganisms and the transfer of organic phosphorus from soil to bodies of water.[1]  Many organisms rely on the soil derived phosphorus for their phosphorus nutrition.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrients are important to the growth and survival of living organisms, and hence, are essential for development and maintenance of healthy ecosystems. Humans have greatly influenced the phosphorus cycle by mining phosphorus, converting it to fertilizer, and by shipping fertilizer and products around the globe. Transporting phosphorus in food from farms to cities has made a major change in the global Phosphorus cycle. However, excessive amounts of nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, are detrimental to aquatic ecosystems. Waters are enriched in phosphorus from farms' run-off, and from effluent that is inadequately treated before it is discharged to waters. Natural eutrophication is a process by which lakes gradually age and become more productive and may take thousands of years to progress. Cultural or anthropogenic eutrophication, however, is water pollution caused by excessive plant nutrients; this results in excessive growth in the algal population; when this algae dies its putrefaction depletes the water of oxygen.  Such eutrophication may also give rise to toxic algal bloom.  Both these effects cause animal and plant death rates to increase as the plants take in poisonous water while the animals drink the poisoned water. Surface and subsurface runoff and erosion from high-phosphorus soils may be major contributing factors to this fresh water eutrophication. The processes controlling soil Phosphorus release to surface runoff and to subsurface flow are a complex interaction between the type of phosphorus input, soil type and management, and transport processes depending on hydrological conditions.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRepeated application of liquid hog manure in excess to crop needs can have detrimental effects on soil phosphorus status. Also, application of biosolids may increase available phosphorus in soil.[12] In poorly drained soils or in areas where snowmelt can cause periodic waterlogging, dereducing conditions can be attained in 7ÿ10 days. This causes a sharp increase in phosphorus concentration in solution and phosphorus can be leached. In addition, reduction of the soil causes a shift in phosphorus from resilient to more labile forms. This could eventually increase the potential for phosphorus loss. This is of particular concern for the environmentally sound management of such areas, where disposal of agricultural wastes has already become a problem. It is suggested that the water regime of soils that are to be used for organic wastes disposal is taken into account in the preparation of waste management regulations.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman interference in the phosphorus cycle occurs by overuse or careless use of phosphorus fertilizers. This results in increased amounts of phosphorus as pollutants in bodies of water resulting in eutrophication. Eutrophication devastates water ecosystems by inducing anoxic conditions.[14]","input":"What is the purpose of the phosphorus cycle?"},{"output":"the King James Version","context":"Partial Bible translations into languages of the English people can be traced back to the late 7th century, including translations into Old and Middle English. More than 450 translations into English have been written.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Revised Standard Version is the version most commonly preferred by biblical scholars.[1] In the United States, 55% of survey respondents who read the Bible reported using the King James Version in 2014, followed by 19% for the New International Version, with other versions used by fewer than 10%.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough John Wycliffe is often credited with the first translation of the Bible into English, there were in fact many translations of large parts of the Bible centuries before Wycliffe's work. The English Bible was first translated from the Latin Vulgate into Old English by a few select monks and scholars. Such translations were generally in the form of prose or as interlinear glosses (literal translations above the Latin words). \\r\\n\\r\\nVery few complete translations existed during that time. Most of the books of the Bible existed separately and were read as individual texts. Thus the sense of the Bible as history that often exists today did not exist at that time. Instead, an allegorical rendering of the Bible was more common and translations of the Bible often included the writers own commentary on passages in addition to the literal translation.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the end of the 7th century, the Venerable Bede began a translation of scripture into Old English (often incorrectly called  Anglo-Saxon).  Aldhelm (c. 639ÿ709) translated the complete Book of Psalms and large portions of other scriptures into Old English.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 10th century an Old English translation of the Gospels was made in the Lindisfarne Gospels: a word-for-word gloss inserted between the lines of the Latin text by Aldred, Provost of Chester-le-Street.[3] This is the oldest extant translation of the Gospels into the English language.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wessex Gospels (also known as the West-Saxon Gospels) are a full translation of the four gospels into a West Saxon dialect of Old English. Produced in approximately 990, they are the first translation of all four gospels into English without the Latin text.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 11th century, Abbot ?lfric translated much of the Old Testament into Old English. The Old English Hexateuch is an illuminated manuscript of the first six books of the Old Testament without lavish illustrations and including a translation of the Book of Judges in addition to the 5 books of the Pentateuch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ormulum is in Middle English of the 12th century. Like its Old English precursor from ?lfric, an Abbot of Eynsham, it includes very little Biblical text, and focuses more on personal commentary. This style was adopted by many of the original English translators. For example, the story of the Wedding at Cana is almost 800 lines long, but fewer than 40 lines are the actual translation of the text. An unusual characteristic is that the translation mimics Latin verse, and so is similar to the better known and appreciated 14th-century English poem, Cursor Mundi.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Rolle (1290ÿ1349) wrote an English Psalter. Many religious works are attributed to Rolle, but it has been questioned how many are genuinely from his hand. Many of his works were concerned with personal devotion, and some were used by the Lollards.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 14th century theologian John Wycliffe is credited with translating what is now known as Wycliffe's Bible, though it is not clear how much of the translation he himself did.[5] This translation  came out in two different versions. The earlier text is characterised by a strong adherence to the word order of Latin, and might have been difficult for the layperson to comprehend. The later text made more concessions to the native grammar of English.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Modern English Bible translations are of between about 1500 and 1800, the period of Early Modern English. This, the first major period of Bible translation into the English language, began with the introduction of the Tyndale Bible. The first complete edition of his New Testament was in 1526. Tyndale used the Greek and Hebrew texts of the New Testament (NT) and Old Testament (OT) in addition to Jerome's Latin translation. He was the first translator to use the printing press ÿ this enabled the distribution of several thousand copies of his New Testament translation throughout England. Tyndale did not complete his Old Testament translation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first printed English translation of the whole bible was produced by Miles Coverdale in 1535, using Tyndale's work together with his own translations from the Latin Vulgate or German text. After much scholarly debate it is concluded that this was printed in Antwerp and the colophon gives the date as 4th October 1535. This first edition was adapted by Coverdale for his first \\"authorised version\\", known as the Great Bible, of 1539. Other early printed versions were the Geneva Bible (1560), notable for being the first Bible divided into verses; the Bishop's Bible (1568), which was an attempt by Elizabeth I to create a new authorised version; and the Authorized King James Version of 1611.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first complete Roman Catholic Bible in English was the DouayÿRheims Bible, of which the New Testament portion was published in Rheims in 1582 and the Old Testament somewhat later in Douay in Gallicant Flanders.  The Old Testament was completed by the time the New Testament was published, but due to extenuating circumstances and financial issues was not published until nearly three decades later, in two editions, the first released in 1609, and the rest of the OT in 1610. In this version, the seven deuterocanonical books are mingled with the other books, rather than kept separate in an appendix.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile early English Bibles were generally based on a small number of Greek texts, or on Latin translations, modern English translations of the Bible are based on a wider variety of manuscripts in the original languages (Greek and Hebrew).  The translators put much scholarly effort into cross-checking the various sources such as the Septuagint, Textus Receptus, and Masoretic Text.  Relatively recent discoveries such as the Dead Sea scrolls provide additional reference information. There is some controversy over which texts should be used as a basis for translation, as some of the alternate sources do not include phrases (or sometimes entire verses) which are found only in the Textus Receptus.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome[who?] say the alternate sources were poorly representative of the texts used in their time, whereas others[who?] claim the Textus Receptus includes passages that were added to the alternate texts improperly.  These controversial passages are not the basis for disputed issues of doctrine, but tend to be additional stories or snippets of phrases. Many modern English translations, such as the New International Version, contain limited text notes indicating where differences occur in original sources.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA somewhat greater number of textual differences are noted in the New King James Bible, indicating hundreds of New Testament differences between the Nestle-Aland, the Textus Receptus, and the Hodges edition of the Majority Text.  The differences in the Old Testament are less well documented, but do contain some references to differences between consonantal interpretations in the Masoretic Text, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Septuagint.  Even with these hundreds of differences, however, a more complete listing is beyond the scope of most single volume Bibles (see Critical Translations below).\\r\\n\\r\\nModern translations take different approaches to the rendering of the original languages of approaches. The approaches can usually be considered to be somewhere on a scale between the two extremes:\\r\\n\\r\\nSome translations have been motivated by a strong theological distinctive, such as the conviction that God's name be preserved in a Semitic form, seen in Sacred Name Bibles. The Purified Translation of the Bible promotes the idea that Jesus and early Christians did not drink wine, but grape juice.[citation needed] The Jehovah's Witnesses' New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures renders the tetragrammaton as Jehovah throughout the Old Testament; it also uses the form Jehovah in the New Testament, including but not limited to passages quoting the Old Testament, even though it does not appear in the Greek text.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutline of Bible-related topics\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most translations are made by committees of scholars in order to avoid bias or idiosyncrasy, translations are sometimes made by individuals. The translation of J.B. Phillips (1958), The Bible in Living English (1972) by Stephen T. Byington, J.N. Darby's Darby Bible (1890), Heinz Cassirer's translation (1989), R.A. Knox (1950), Gerrit Verkuyl's Berkeley Version (1959), The Complete Jewish Bible (1998) by Dr. David H. Stern, Robert Young's Literal Translation (1862), Jay P.Green's Literal Translation (1985), The Emphatic Diaglott by Benjamin Wilson (1864), Noah Webster's Bible Translation (1833), The Original Aramaic Bible in Plain English (2010) by David Bauscher,  American King James Version (1999) by Michael Engelbrite, The Living Bible (1971) by Kenneth N. Taylor, The Modern Reader's Bible (1914) by Richard Moulton, The Five Pauline Epistles, A New Translation (1900) by William Gunion Rutherford, Joseph Bryant Rotherham's Emphasized Bible (1902), Professor S. H. Hooke's The Bible in Basic English (1949), The Holy Name Bible containing the Holy Name Version of the Old and New Testaments (1963) by Angelo Traina, and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message (2002) are largely the work of individual translators. Others, such as Robert Alter, N. T. Wright and Dele Ikeorha  have translated portions of the Bible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost translations make the translators' best attempt at a single rendering of the original, relying on footnotes where there might be alternative translations or textual variants. An alternative is taken by the Amplified Bible. In cases where a word or phrase admits of more than one meaning the Amplified Bible presents all the possible interpretations, allowing the reader to choose one. For example, the first two verses of the Amplified Bible read:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning God (Elohim) created [by forming from nothing] the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void or a waste and emptiness, and darkness was upon the face of the deep [primeval ocean that covered the unformed earth]. The Spirit of God was moving (hovering, brooding) over the face of the waters.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most translations attempt to synthesize the various texts in the original languages, some translations also translate one specific textual source, generally for scholarly reasons. A single volume example for the Old Testament is The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible (ISBN?0-06-060064-0) by Martin Abegg, Peter Flint and Eugene Ulrich.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Comprehensive New Testament (ISBN?978-0-9778737-1-5) by T. E. Clontz and J. Clontz presents a scholarly view of the New Testament text by conforming to the Nestle-Aland 27th edition and extensively annotating the translation to fully explain different textual sources and possible alternative translations.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Comparative Psalter (ISBN?0-19-529760-1) edited by John Kohlenberger presents a comparative diglot translation of the Psalms of the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, using the Revised Standard Version and the New English Translation of the Septuagint.\\r\\n\\r\\nR. A. Knox's Translation of the Vulgate into English is another example of a single source translation.\\r\\n\\r\\nJewish English Bible translations are modern English Bible translations that include the books of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) according to the masoretic text, and according to the traditional division and order of Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim.\\r\\n\\r\\nJewish translations often also reflect traditional Jewish interpretations of the Bible, as opposed to the Christian understanding that is often reflected in non-Jewish translations. For example, Jewish translations translate ???? almah in Isaiah 7:14 as young woman, while many Christian translations render the word as virgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile modern biblical scholarship is similar for both Christians and Jews, there are distinctive features of Jewish translations, even those created by academic scholars. These include the avoidance of Christological interpretations, adherence to the Masoretic Text (at least in the main body of the text, as in the new Jewish Publication Society (JPS) translation) and greater use of classical Jewish exegesis. Some translations prefer names transliterated from the Hebrew, though the majority of Jewish translations use the Anglicized forms of biblical names.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first English Jewish translation of the Bible into English was by Isaac Leeser in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe JPS produced two of the most popular Jewish translations, namely the JPS The Holy Scriptures of 1917 and the NJPS Tanakh (first printed in a single volume in 1985, second edition in 1999).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1980s there have been multiple efforts among Orthodox publishers to produce translations that are not only Jewish, but also adhere to Orthodox norms. Among these are The Living Torah and Nach by Aryeh Kaplan and others, the Torah and other portions in an ongoing project by Everett Fox, and the ArtScroll Tanakh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evangelical Christian Booksellers Association lists the most popular versions of the Bible sold by their members in the United States. Through 29 December 2012, the top 5 best selling translations (based on both dollar and unit sales) are as follows:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSales are affected by denomination and religious affiliation. For example, the most popular Jewish version would not compete with rankings of a larger audience. Sales data can be affected by the method of marketing. Some translations are directly marketed to particular denominations or local churches, and many Christian booksellers only offer Protestant Bibles, so books in other biblical canons (such as Catholic and Orthodox Bibles) may not appear as high on the CBA rank.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study published in 2014 by The Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture at Indiana University and Purdue University found that Americans read versions of the Bible as follows:[12][13]:12ÿ15","input":"What is the most common bible translation in english?"},{"output":"three horizontal stripes: red, yellow and red, the yellow stripe being twice the size of each red stripe","context":"The flag of Spain (Spanish: Bandera de Espa?a, colloquially known as \\"la Rojigualda\\"), as it is defined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978, consists of three horizontal stripes: red, yellow and red, the yellow stripe being twice the size of each red stripe. Traditionally, the middle stripe was defined by the more archaic term of gualda, and hence the popular name rojigualda (red-weld).\\r\\nThe origin of the current flag of Spain is the naval ensign of 1785, Pabell܇n de la Marina de Guerra under Charles III of Spain. It was chosen by Charles III himself among 12 different flags designed by Antonio Valds y Bazn (all projected flags were presented in a drawing which is in the Naval Museum of Madrid).[1] The flag remained marine for much of the next 50?years, flying over coastal fortresses, marine barracks and other naval property. During the Peninsular War the flag could also be found on marine regiments fighting inland. Not until 1820 was the first Spanish land unit (The La Princesa Regiment) provided with one and it was not until 1843 that Queen Isabella II of Spain would make the flag official.[2]\\r\\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the color scheme of the flag remained intact, with the exception of the Second Republic period (1931ÿ1939); the only changes centered on the coat of arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag used by the Spanish Armed Forces is the same one that is used as the state flag and national ensign. Military units, however, use a less oblong, more square version (full size dimensions 12.80 by 14.75 metres (42.0?ft G?48.4?ft)) charged with the name of the unit.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Spanish naval jack (Bandera de Proa o de Tajamar) is only hoisted at the prow of all Navy ships when docked or anchored in foreign waters, from sunrise to sunset. In national waters it is hoisted on Sundays, festivities and in presence of a foreign warship as soon as it moors at the dock. The national flag is always hoisted at the stern, when sailing, and from sunrise to sunset, when docked.[3] It is a square flag (ratio 1:1) composed of 4?quarters:[4]\\r\\nThe King of Spain (Spanish: Rey de Espa?a) uses a flag known as the Royal Standard. The Royal Standard of Spain consists of a crimson square with the Coat of arms of the King in the center. It is usually flown at the King's official residence, the Palacio de la Zarzuela, other Spanish royal sites, displayed on his official car as small flags. It is regulated by Rule 2 of Royal Decree 527/2014, 20 June, an amendment to Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977 adopting Flags, Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation.[5]\\r\\nThe Royal Guidon (Gui܇n), the monarch's military personal ensign, is described by Rule 1 of Royal Decree 527/2014, an amendment to Title II, Rule 1 of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977.[5] It is nearly identical to the Royal Standard except that the Royal Guidon has a Gold fringe.[6] It is made of silk's taffeta. The size of the guidon is 80 x 80?cm. It is the personal command ensign or positional flag of the monarch, and is carried nearby him.\\r\\nThe heiress of the crown, the Princess of Asturias, has her own standard and guidon. The Standard of the Princess of Asturias (Estandarte de la Princesa de Asturias) is regulated by Royal Decree 284/2001 that modified the Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977. The Standard of the Princess of Asturias consists of a light blue (the colour of the flag of Asturias) square flag with the coat of arms of the Princess of Asturias in the center. The Guidon (Gui܇n) is identical to the Standard except that the Royal Guidon has a gold fringe. It is made of silk taffeta. The size of the guidon is 80 x 80?cm. It has fallen into disuse because of the Princess's early age.\\r\\nSome high-ranking officials of the Spanish state (i.e., the president, the vice-presidents and the ministers of the government, or the chairmen of the Congress of Deputies and the Senate) are entitled to display a flag representative of their status. It is a square flag of Spain with the Spanish coat of arms centered on the yellow stripe.\\r\\nThe flag for private sport and leisure boats (in Spanish: bandera de embarcaciones de recreo) is the flag of Spain charged with the royal crown in blue in the center of the yellow stripe. This flag was first established in 1875 by Royal Decree (decreto real), which provided that the central stripe would display the royal crown (corona real); this flag apparently continued to be used following the creation of the Spanish Republic in 1931, but the royal crown was changed to a blue \\"mural\\" crown or a blue coronet; the current versiondepicting the royal crown in bluewas introduced following the restoration of the monarchy.\\r\\nThe present laws and regulations on the Spanish flag are:\\r\\nLa bandera de Espa?a est formada por tres franjas horizontales, roja, amarilla y roja, siendo la amarilla de doble anchura que cada una de las rojas.\\r\\nArtculo 4 1 de la constituci܇n espa?ola de 1978\\r\\nTranslation:\\r\\nThe flag of Spain consists of three horizontal stripes: red, yellow and red, the yellow strip being twice as wide as each red stripe.\\r\\nArticle 4.1 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978\\r\\nThe colours of the flag, as officially defined by the Spanish Royal Decree 441/1981 of 27 February,[10] are:\\r\\nThe nearest Pantone shades are 7628 C (red) and 7406 C (yellow).\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag of Spain with the coat of arms is specified by rule 3 of the Royal Decree 1511/1977, that states the following:\\r\\nThe flag can only be flown horizontally from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Spain and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis (during the night, it must be properly lit). The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.[7]\\r\\nFor mourning activities, the flag can be flown in either of the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted to the top of the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During the funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.[7]\\r\\nWhen flying the Spanish flag with other flags, the following is the correct order of precedence: The national flag, flags of foreign states, the flag of the European Union, international NGOs, military and government standards, Autonomous communities flags, city flags and any others. When foreign flags are used alongside the Spanish flag, the flags are sorted according to their countries' names in the Spanish language. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Spain dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The flag of Europe has been hoisted since Spain became a member of the Union. While not mentioned by name in the law, the flag of NATO can be used in Spain, since it belongs to that organization as well.[7]\\r\\nWhen unfurled in the presence of other flags, the national flag must not have smaller dimensions and must be situated in a prominent, honorable place, according to the relevant protocol.[7]\\r\\nWhile the concept of a national flag did not exist in the Middle Ages, the symbol of Spain was the Royal Shield. It was frequently made up of other different flags, full of images and symbols that represented all the values that the troops or the King defended.\\r\\nIn Spain the medieval kingdoms which merged in the sixteenth century had their own heraldic symbols and their navies used to display their own flags and standards on both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, where the Aragonese and Castilian Crowns had their respective areas of influence. The flag of the Crown of Aragon was a yellow flag with four red stripes (an element which is still common in the present flags of the territories that formed the Crown: Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in France). The Crown of Castile, since the final union between the kingdoms of Castile and Le܇n in 1230, used a quartered flag alternating the Castilian (Gules, a tower Or, masoned sable and ajour azure) and Leonese (Argent, a lion rampant purpure crowned or, langued and armed gules) emblems. Aragonese and Castilian flags and coats of arms merged when the Catholic monarchs created the new symbols of their personal union of the crowns in 1475.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe banner of Castile and Le܇n was the first European symbol to arrive in the New World.[11]\\r\\nThe Cross of Burgundy is one of the most important flags in the history of Spain, because after the marriage of Joanna of Castile (Joanna the Mad), daughter of the Catholic monarch, to the Archduke of Austria (later Philip I of Castile (Philip the Handsome)) in 1496, it introduced in to Spanish vexillology a design that, although of foreign origin, would later become the primary Spanish symbol by antonomasia, regardless of the color of the cloth on which it was embroidered (usually white or yellow). It is more properly called \\"Cruz de San Andrs\\" (Saint Andrew's Cross) or \\"the Vane of Burgundy\\". It functioned as the symbol of the Archduke. Since the reign of Charles I of Spain (1516-1556), different Spanish armies have used flags with the Cross of Burgundy on different fields. It was also incorporated in the uniforms of Burgundian archers, and later in the uniforms of the rest of the army. It also appeared on Spanish regimental flags.\\r\\nWhen the House of Habsburg took the Spanish throne by mid-16th century each military company had its own flag in which appeared usually the arms of its commander over the Cross of Burgundy. In order to represent the King, they used to have another one, the \\"Coronela\\", during the reign of Charles I (Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor) that was made of yellow silk (the imperial color) with the embroidered imperial shield.[12]\\r\\nWhen Philip II came to power, he ordered that, in addition to the flags of each company, each Tercio should have another one of yellow color with the Cross of Burgundy in red. The units of Cavalry took the same flags but of smaller size, called Banners.\\r\\nHowever, at this time the concept of a national flag as understood nowadays did not exist, and so the true symbol of the nationality was represented by the Royal arms. The use of other flags besides the mentioned ones was frequent, with various images or symbols. Some examples are the flag of Santiago (Saint James the Great), the green one the Emperor took during the conquest of Tunisia or the crimson one used by Hernn Corts in Mexico.\\r\\nThe arms of Bourbon-Anjou were added in 1700 when Philip V became king of Spain. He introduced several changes on the royal arms. The king's new arms were designed by the French heraldists Charles-Ren d'Hozier and Pierre Clairambault[13] in November 1700. Philip V also changed the philosophy and the design of the flags of Spain. He was the first to give Spain a unified symbol of its own when putting on white fabric the Cross of Burgundy and the Royal coat of arms.[14] It still was not a national flag, but a first \\"try\\", in line with similar attempts in other European nations.\\r\\nThe flags were organized in three groups:\\r\\nIn 1760 Charles III modified the shield of the Royal arms, suppressing the necklace of the Holy Spirit, maintained the Golden Fleece and added two new quarters, corresponding to the House of Farnese (six blue lilies on gold) and Medici (blue disc with three lilies of gold and five red discs, all on gold).\\r\\nThe military flag or Coronela of Spanish regiments was, during the Bourbon years, the Cross of Burgundy with different additions in each military unit depending on their territorial origin, commander, etc.\\r\\nWhen Charles III became King of Spain, he observed that most of the countries in Europe used flags which were predominantly white and, since they were frequently at war with each other, lamentable confusions occurred at sea, it being difficult to determine if a sighted ship were enemy until practically the last moment. For this reason, he ordered to his Minister of the Navy to present several models of flags to him, having to be visible from great distances. The Minister selected twelve sketches which were shown to the king. The flag that was chosen as war ensign is the direct ancestor of the current flag. It was a triband red-yellow-red, of which the yellow band was twice the width of the red bands, a unique feature that distinguished the Spanish tribanded flag from other tribanded European flags. The flag chosen as civil ensign or for Merchant Marine use, meanwhile, consisted of five stripes of yellow-red-yellow-red-yellow, in proportions 1:1:2:1:1.\\r\\nOn 14 April 1931, the monarchy was overthrown and replaced by the Second Spanish Republic. The regime change was symbolized by a new tricolor flag, red, yellow and murrey (Spanish: morado), instead of the previous red and yellow bicolor, considered, at the time, monarchist. The purported aim of the murrey strip was to represent Castile and Le܇n in the flag's colours, as the existing red and yellow represented the territories of the former Crown of Aragon. The Republican flag was officially adopted on 27 April and officially given to the army on 6 May. Formed by three horizontal strips of the same width, red, yellow and morado, with the coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic at the center (quarterly of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Navarre, Ent en point for Granada, stamped by a mural crown between the two Pillars of Hercules). Another novelty was the smaller dimensions of this flag in its military version, of 1?m by 1?m.\\r\\nAs for the addition of the murrey to represent Castile in the national flag, since the last quarter of the 20th century there are authors that contradict former historians sustaining that the Castilian banner was not murrey, but crimson.[15]\\r\\nThe Spanish Civil War officially ended on 1 April 1939, when the last Spanish Republican outposts were overrun by the army in revolt. The Republican regime in Spain was destroyed and Francisco Franco became the dictator of the country and remained in power until his death on 20 November 1975.\\r\\nOn 29 August 1936, the \\"Junta de Defensa Nacional\\", issued Decree No. 77, that declared: \\"The red and gold/yellow bicolour flag is re-established as the flag of Spain\\", which served as the first flag of Nationalist Spain. This flag was replaced in 1938 by a flag bearing the eagle of John the Evangelist added to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the Catholic Monarchs adopted after the taking of Granada from the Moors, but replacing the arms of Sicily for those of Navarre and adding the Pillars of Hercules on each flank of the coat of arms. In 1938 the columns were placed outside the wings.\\r\\nOn 26 July 1945, the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree, and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published, that fixed the model of the bi-color flag in use, with a new version of the Saint John eagle. The models established on that decree were in force until 1977.\\r\\nDuring this period two more flags were usually displayed together with the national flag: the flag of Spanish Falange (three vertical strips, red, black, red, with the black stripe being wider than the red ones, and the yoke and arrows emblem in red placed on the center of the black stripe) and the Carlist flag (the Saint Andrew saltire or Cross of Burgundy red on white) as representation of the National Movement.\\r\\nFrom the death of Franco in 1975, in 1977, the national flag remained that of the 1945 regulation. On 21 January 1977 a new flag was approved that differed from the previous one in that the eagle's wings opened further (the \\"pasmada\\" eagle), the Pillars of Hercules were again placed within the wings, and the ribbon with the motto UNA, GRANDE Y LIBRE (ONE, GREAT and FREE) was moved from the eagle's neck to above the eagle's head. Not many flags with this coat of arms were made. Finally, and after the restoration of the House of Bourbon to the Spanish Throne in the person of King Juan Carlos I, the Spanish Constitution of 1978 was published, article 42 section 12 of which reads \\"The Flag of Spain is formed by three horizontal stripes, red, yellow and red, the yellow being double the width of each of the red ones.\\"\\r\\nThe national flag of Spain finally received its present-day coat of arms on 19 December 1981.","input":"What does the flag of spain look like?"},{"output":"Allison DuBois","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAllison DuBois (born January 24, 1972) is an American author and purported medium. DuBois has used her psychic abilities to assist U.S. law enforcement officials in solving crimes, forming the basis of the TV series Medium.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer powers as a medium were tested by Gary Schwartz of the University of Arizona.Schwartz claimed that his research supports DuBois's psychic abilities, skeptics have pointed out flaws in both DuBois's claims and Schwartz's research. A show called Medium is based on Allison's experiences and she is a consultant for the show.  She has visions, of both the past and the future, but it's mainly the dreams that help the police solve crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuBois was born in Phoenix, Arizona, where she attended both North High School in Phoenix and Corona del Sol High School in Tempe. Despite dropping out, she obtained her GED at the age of 16.[1] In college, she worked as an intern at the district attorney's office in Phoenix. She received her B.A. in political science with a minor in history from Arizona State University.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuBois refers to herself as a medium and profiler, rather than a psychic, because of the negative connotation she feels is associated with the term \\"psychic.\\" She claims that she became aware that she had the ability to communicate with departed souls when she was 6 years old.[3] DuBois claims she uses this ability to connect deceased loved ones to the living, and also to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes, such as the Texas Rangers and the Glendale, Arizona police department, and that she used these abilities as a jury consultant.[4] These law enforcement agencies have since either denied any such cooperation happened or stated the tips provided by DuBois were not helpful.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the TV Guide, Allison DuBois spent four years participating in various tests at the University of Arizona to assist with their studies of mediums and psychic phenomena. Gary Schwartz, Director of The VERITAS Research Project, claims that DuBois has psychic abilities, arguing in the March 6, 2005 TV Guide, \\"Anyone who's looked closely at the evidence can't help but come to the conclusion that there is something very real going on here.\\" At their first meeting, Schwartz says DuBois accurately described a friend of Schwartz's who had just died. Impressed, Schwartz conducted a series of interviews, including one in which DuBois stated she contacted the late husband of a woman in England, knowing only the woman's name. The woman, after reading a transcript of the session, affirmed that 80% of what DuBois said was accurate.[6] Schwartz published his research in a book titled The Truth About Medium. According to a statement by DuBois, she does not endorse the book or Schwartz.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe television drama Medium, which aired from 2005 until 2011 on NBC and CBS[8] is based on Allison DuBois's book, Don't Kiss Them Good-Bye.  The show was created by Glenn Gordon Caron, creator of Moonlighting and other television shows, who is also one of the writers for the series.  It is produced by CBS Television Studios (having acquired the TV production arm of original producer Paramount Pictures) and Grammnet, the production company owned by Cheers and Frasier alumnus Kelsey Grammer.  Patricia Arquette was cast to play the role of DuBois, at the suggestion of Caron's girlfriend. DuBois stated in the January 9, 2005 TV Guide that she initially thought Arquette was too liberal to play her, remarking, \\"I mean, I have a gun, I have put people on death row. I wanted to make sure that was something that didn't bother her. But she assured me that she believed some people may have that coming.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Every episode is not a biography of my life, it is simply based on my life experiences. It is an accurate portrayal of my life and the people who share it with a little Hollywood magic thrown in,\\" DuBois has said.[3] She does state in both her book and in the edition of January 3, 2005 of Sci Fi Weekly that the program closely resembles the truth of her own life.[4] Several details of Arquette's character match DuBois's life, such as the name of her husband on the show (Joe) and the fact that he is an aerospace engineer.  Both the character and the real-life DuBois have three daughters, and the first case the character \\"consults\\" on in the show's pilot is with the Texas Rangers, the law enforcement agency with whom the real-life DuBois alleges she first worked.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkeptics such as Paul Kurtz and Ray Hyman say that DuBois does not have psychic powers.[6] Skeptic James Randi says that people such as DuBois give the appearance of psychic powers through cold reading techniques. For example, DuBois, when doing her first reading of Schwartz, told him that his deceased friend was telling her, \\"I don't walk alone,\\" which Schwartz understood to be a reference to his friend's confinement to a wheelchair, which DuBois could not have known about. Randi says that Schwartz leapt to an unsupportable conclusion, since the notion of \\"not walking alone\\" can mean any number of things, and \\"certainly does not describe being in a wheelchair.\\" Randi also asserts that experiments that allegedly yield positive results of psychic powers, such as the ones done with DuBois, are not conducted using proper scientific controls.[9][10] In light of Schwartz's assertion that \\"some\\" of his experiments with DuBois were performed under such conditions, Randi questions why the rest of them were not, and points to a report demonstrating that a few of Schwartz's experiments were not performed according to standard scientific protocol.[9][11] Schwartz's point-by-point response to Randi's criticisms was published in 2005.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Randi offered to have DuBois tested for his One Million Dollar Challenge.  According to Randi, DuBois declined his invitation to the challenge.[13] In 2011, the JREF again issued the million dollar challenge to James Van Praagh, Allison DuBois, Sylvia Browne, Carla Baron, John Edward, and others to prove their abilities in controlled experiments, commenting, \\"James Van Praagh and Allison DuBois have turned the huckster art of 'cold reading' into a multi-million-dollar industry, preying on families' deepest fears and regrets,\\" he says in a statement announcing the challenge. \\"They should be embarrassed by the transparent performances.\\"[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer FBI profiler, behavioral science expert and MSNBC analyst Clint Van Zandt challenges statements about psychics helping law enforcement arguing, \\"If psychics were truly successful and if their results were not simply the consequence of trickery (at worse [sic]) or good interviewing skills (at best), then why don't law enforcement agencies have psychic detective squads, a real X-Files Unit, or other ways to integrate these paranormal investigative capabilities?\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuBois's parents, Mike Gomez and Tienna DuBois, divorced when she was a baby.

It is a transliteration of the Hebrew word ???????????? (Modern halleluya, Tiberian hall?l?yh), which is composed of two elements: ???????? (second-person imperative masculine plural form of the Hebrew verb hillel: an exhortation to \\"praise\\" addressed to several people[1]) and ???? (the name of God Jah or Yah).[2][3][4]\\r\\nThe term is used 24 times in the Hebrew Bible (in the book of Psalms), twice in deuterocanonical books, and four times in the Christian Book of Revelation.[5]\\r\\nThe word is used in Judaism as part of the Hallel prayers, and in Christian prayer,[5] where since the earliest times[6] it is used in various ways in liturgies,[7] especially those of the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church,[8] both of which use the form \\"alleluia\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n???????????? is found in 23 verses in the Book of Psalms (104ÿ106, 111ÿ117, 135, 145ÿ150), but twice in Psalm 150:6. It starts and concludes a number of Psalms.\\r\\nThe Greek transliteration ???ϫ (alllouia) appears in the Septuagint version of these Psalms, in Tobit 13:17 and 3 Maccabees 7:13, and four times in Revelation 19:1ÿ6, the great song of praise to God for his triumph over the Whore of Babylon.[5][6] It is this usage that Charles Jennens extracted for the Hallelujah Chorus in Handel's Messiah.\\r\\nIn the Hebrew Bible hallelujah is actually a two-word phrase, not one word. The first part, hallelu, is the second-person imperative masculine plural form of the Hebrew verb hillel.[1] However, \\"hallelujah\\" means more than simply \\"praise Jah\\" or \\"praise Yah\\", as the word hallel in Hebrew means a joyous praise in song, to boast in God. Hallel could also refer to someone who acts madly or foolishly.[9][10]\\r\\nThe second part, Yah, is a shortened form of YHWH, the name for the Creator.[5] The name ceased to be pronounced in Second Temple Judaism, by the 3rd century BC due to religious beliefs.[11] The correct pronunciation is not known, however, it is sometimes rendered by Christians as \\"Yahweh\\" or \\"Jehovah\\". The Septuagint translates Yah as Kyrios (the LORD), because of the Jewish custom of replacing the sacred name with \\"Adonai\\", meaning \\"the Lord\\".\\r\\nIn Psalm 150:6 the Hebrew reads kol han'shamah t'hallel yah halelu-yah;[12] the first \\"hallel\\" and \\"yah\\" in this verse are two separate words, and the word \\"yah\\" is translated as \\"the LORD\\", or \\"YHWH\\". In Psalm 148:1 the Hebrew says \\"???? ?? hallelu yah\\". It then says \\"hallelu eth-YHWH\\" as if using \\"yah\\" and \\"YHWH\\" interchangeably. The word \\"Yah\\" appears by itself as a divine name in poetry about 49 times in the Hebrew Bible (including hallelu yah), such as in Psalm 68:4ÿ5 \\"who rides upon the skies by his name Yah\\" and Exodus 15:2 \\"Yah is my strength and song\\". It also often appears at the end of Israelite theophoric names such as Isaiah \\"yeshayah(u), Yahweh is salvation\\" and Jeremiah \\"yirmeyah(u), Yahweh is exalted\\".[5]\\r\\nThe word hallelujah occurring in the Psalms is therefore a request for a congregation to join in praise toward God. It can be translated as \\"Praise Yah\\" or \\"Praise Jah, you people\\".[2][7][13]\\r\\nMost well-known English versions of the Hebrew Bible translate the Hebrew \\"Hallelujah\\" (as at Psalm 150:1) as two Hebrew words, generally rendered as \\"Praise (ye)\\" and \\"the LORD\\", but the second word is given as \\"Yah\\" in the Lexham English Bible and Young's Literal Translation, \\"Jah\\" in the New World Translation, \\"Jehovah\\" in the American Standard Version, and \\"Hashem\\" in the Artscroll Tanach (Orthodox Jewish). Instead of a translation, the transliteration \\"Hallelujah\\" is used by JPS Tanakh, International Standard Version, Darby Translation, God's Word Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, and The Message, with the spelling \\"Halleluyah\\" appearing in the Complete Jewish Bible. The Greek-influenced form \\"Alleluia\\" appears in Wycliffe's Bible, the Knox Version and the New Jerusalem Bible.\\r\\nIn the great song of praise to God for his triumph over the Whore of Babylon[5] in chapter 19 of the New Testament book of Revelation, the Greek word ???ϫ (allluia), a transliteration of the same Hebrew word, appears four times, as an expression of praise rather than an exhortation to praise.[6] In English translations this is mostly rendered as \\"Hallelujah\\",[14] but as \\"Alleluia\\" in several translations,[15] while a few have \\"Praise the Lord\\",[16] \\"Praise God\\",[17] \\"Praise our God\\",[18] or \\"Thanks to our God\\".[19]\\r\\nThe word \\"hallelujah\\" is sung as part of the Hallel Psalms (interspersed between Psalms 113ÿ150).[20] In Tractate Shabbat of the Talmud, Rabbi Yose is quoted as saying that the Pesukei dezimra Psalms should be recited daily.[21] Psalms 145-150, also known as the Hallel of pesukei dezimra, are included to fulfill this requirement in the liturgy for the traditional Jewish Shacharit (morning) service.[22] In addition, on the three Pilgrimage Festivals, the new moon and Hanukkah, Psalms 115-118 are recited.[23] The latter psalms are known simply as Hallel with no additional qualification.\\r\\nPsalms 146:10, ending with Halleluja, is the third and final biblical quotation in the Kedushah. This expanded version of the third blessing in the Amidah is said during the Shacharit and Mincha (morning and afternoon) services when there is a minyan present.[24]\\r\\nFor most Christians, \\"Hallelujah\\" is considered a joyful word of praise to God, rather than an injunction to praise him. \\"The Alleluia\\" refers to a traditional chant, combining the word with verses from the Psalms or other scripture. In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, and in many older Protestant denominations, the Alleluia, along with the Gloria in excelsis Deo, is not spoken or sung in liturgy during the season of Lent, instead being replaced by a Lenten acclamation, while in Eastern Churches, Alleluia is chanted throughout Lent at the beginning of the Matins service, replacing the Theos Kyrios, which is considered more joyful. At the Easter service and throughout the Pentecostarion, Christos anesti is used in the place where Hallelujah is chanted in the western rite expressing happiness.\\r\\nIn contemporary worship among many Protestants, expressions of \\"Hallelujah\\" and \\"Praise the Lord\\" are acceptable spontaneous expressions of joy, thanksgiving and praise towards God, requiring no specific prompting or call or direction from those leading times of praise and singing.[25]\\r\\nIn modern English, \\"Hallelujah\\" is frequently spoken to express happiness that a thing hoped or waited for has happened.[26] An example is its use in the song \\"Get Happy\\".","input":"How many times is hallelujah mentioned in the bible?"},{"output":"Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","context":"The First Continental Congress was a meeting of delegates from twelve of the Thirteen Colonies who met from September 5 to October 26, 1774 at Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania early in the American Revolution. It was called in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament, which the British referred to as the Coercive Acts, with which the British intended to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party.\\r\\nThe Congress met briefly to consider options, including an economic boycott of British trade and drawing up a list of rights and grievances; in the end, they petitioned King George III for redress of those grievances.\\r\\nThe Congress also called for another Continental Congress in the event that their petition was unsuccessful in halting enforcement of the Intolerable Acts. Their appeal to the Crown had no effect, and so the Second Continental Congress was convened the following year to organize the defense of the colonies at the onset of the American Revolutionary War. The delegates also urged each colony to set up and train its own militia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congress met from September 5 to October 26, 1774. Peyton Randolph presided over the proceedings; Henry Middleton took over as President of the Congress from October 22 to 26. Charles Thomson, leader of Philadelphia Committee of Correspondence, was selected to be Secretary of the Continental Congress.[1]\\r\\nThe delegates who attended were not of one mind concerning why they were there. Conservatives such as Joseph Galloway, John Dickinson, John Jay, and Edward Rutledge believed their task to be forging policies to pressure Parliament to rescind its unreasonable acts. Their ultimate goal was to develop a reasonable solution to the difficulties and bring about reconciliation between the Colonies and Great Britain. Others such as Patrick Henry, Roger Sherman, Samuel Adams, and John Adams believed their task to be developing a decisive statement of the rights and liberties of the Colonies. Their ultimate goal was to end what they felt to be the abuses of parliamentary authority, and to retain their rights which had been guaranteed under both Colonial charters and the English constitution.[2]\\r\\nRoger Sherman denied the legislative authority of Parliament, and Patrick Henry believed that the Congress needed to develop a completely new system of government, independent from Great Britain, for the existing Colonial governments were already dissolved.[3] In contrast to these ideas, Joseph Galloway put forward a \\"Plan of Union\\" which suggested that an American legislative body be formed with some authority, whose consent would be required for imperial measures.[3][4]\\r\\nIn the end, the voices of compromise carried the day. Rather than calling for independence, the First Continental Congress passed and signed the Continental Association in its Declaration and Resolves, which called for a boycott of British goods to take effect in December 1774. It requested that local Committees of Safety enforce the boycott and regulate local prices for goods. These resolutions adopted by the Congress did not endorse any legal power of Parliament to regulate trade, but consented, nonetheless, to the operation of acts for that purpose. Furthermore, they did not repudiate control by the royal prerogative, which was explicitly acknowledged in the Petition to the King a few days later.\\r\\nThe Congress had two primary accomplishments. The first was a compact among the Colonies to boycott British goods beginning on December 1, 1774.[5] The West Indies were threatened with a boycott unless the islands agreed to non-importation of British goods.[6] Imports from Britain dropped by 97 percent in 1775, compared with the previous year.[5] Committees of observation and inspection were to be formed in each Colony to ensure compliance with the boycott. All of the Colonial Houses of Assembly approved the proceedings of the Congress, with the exception of New York.[7]\\r\\nIf the Intolerable Acts were not repealed, the Colonies would also cease exports to Britain after September 10, 1775.[5] The boycott was successfully implemented, but its potential for altering British colonial policy was cut off by the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\nThe second accomplishment of the Congress was to provide for a Second Continental Congress to meet on May 10, 1775. In addition to the Colonies which had sent delegates to the First Continental Congress, the Congress resolved on October 21, 1774 to send letters of invitation to Quebec, Saint John's Island (now Prince Edward Island), Nova Scotia, Georgia, East Florida, and West Florida.[8] However, letters appear to have been sent only to Quebec (three letters in all). None of these other colonies sent delegates to the opening of the Second Congress, though a delegation from Georgia arrived the following July.[9]","input":"Where was the first continental congress meeting held?"},{"output":"Jeff Hornacek","context":"The New York Knickerbockers are an American professional basketball team based in New York City.

Membership subsequently stabilised until Cliff Williams replaced Mark Evans as bassist in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist.[8] The band eventually tapped Geordie singer Brian Johnson to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album Back in Black, which they made in Scott's memory. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.\\r\\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. The band fired Phil Rudd as drummer in 1983, and ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright filled in Rudd's place. In 1989, Wright would himself leave the band so he could join Dio. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who had been with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in his favour, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide.[9] The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on due to worsening hearing loss, and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background vocalist Cliff Williams retired from the band at the end of their 2016 Rock or Bust world tour.\\r\\nAC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States, adding them to the list of highest-certified music artists in the United States and the list of best-selling music artists.[10][11][12] Back in Black has sold an estimated 50?million units worldwide, making it the second-highest-selling album by any artist ÿ and the highest-selling album by any band.

Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \\"the greatest rock and roll band of all time\\".[17] In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC number 23 in its list of the \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrothers Malcolm, Angus, and George Young were born in Glasgow, Scotland living at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill area.[19] The Big Freeze of 1963 was the worst winter on record in Scotland with snow eight feet deep. A TV advertisement at the same time offered assisted travel for families for a different life in Australia.[20] 15 members of the Young family left Scotland by aeroplane in late June 1963. Before moving into a house at 4 Burleigh Street in the suburb of Burwood they initially stayed at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later developed as Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, where George Young met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda.[20]\\r\\nGeorge was the first to learn to play the guitar. He became a member of the Easybeats, one of Australia's most successful bands of the 1960s. In 1966, they became the first local rock act to have an international hit, with the song \\"Friday on My Mind\\".[21] Malcolm followed in George's footsteps by playing with a Newcastle, New South Wales, band called the Velvet Underground (not to be confused with the New York-based Velvet Underground).[22] Their older brother Alex Young chose to remain in Britain to pursue musical interests. In 1967, Alexander formed and played bass in the London-based band Grapefruitinitially called \\"The Grapefruit\\"with three former members of Tony Rivers and the Castaways, John Perry, Geoff Swettenham, and Pete Swettenham.\\r\\nMalcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials \\"AC/DC\\" on a sewing machine. \\"AC/DC\\" is an abbreviation meaning \\"alternating current/direct current\\" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.[23][24] \\"AC/DC\\" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as \\"Acca Dacca\\" in Australia.[25][26] The AC/DC band name is stylised with a high voltage sign separating the \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.[27]\\r\\nIn November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC and recruited bassist Larry Van Kriedt, vocalist Dave Evans, and Colin Burgess, ex-Masters Apprentices drummer.[28] Pushing hard for the band's success were Australia's roadie Ray Arnold and his partner Alan Kissack. Gene Pierson booked the band to play at Chequers nightclub on New Year's Eve, 1973.[29]\\r\\nBy this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang.[22] In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit.\\r\\nOn stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. In Paul Stenning's book AC/DC: Two Sides To Every Glory it is stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's ill feeling toward Evans.[30] By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.\\r\\nSome time in 1974, on the recommendation of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club, the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.[31]\\r\\nThe Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.[30] Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.\\r\\nIn September 1974, Ronald Belford \\"Bon\\" Scott, an experienced vocalist and friend of George Young, replaced Dave Evans[32] after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him to George Young.[8] Scott's appointment coincided with him working as a chauffeur for the band at the time until an audition promoted him to lead singer.[33] Like the Young brothers, Scott was born in Scotland and emigrated to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, \\"Can I Sit Next To You, Girl\\" / \\"Rockin' in the Parlour\\"; eventually, the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott as \\"Can I Sit Next to You Girl\\" (Track 7 on the Australian album TNT (1975), and Track 6 on the international release of High Voltage (1976)).\\r\\nBy October 1974, the Australia-only album High Voltage had been recorded. It took only ten days[34] and was based on instrumental songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans, and drummer Phil Rudd. Later that year they released the single \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song on the back of a flatbed truck. The song is regarded as their perennial rock anthem.[35] It was included on their second album, T.N.T. (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. T.N.T. featured the song \\"High Voltage\\", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because \\"High Voltage\\" was released as a single before T.N.T. was released, some people thought it was the title track to AC/DC's debut album.\\r\\nAC/DC were scheduled to play at the 1975 Sunbury music festival; however, they went home without performing following an altercation with the management of headlining act Deep Purple.[36]\\r\\nBetween 1974 and 1977, aided by regular appearances on Molly Meldrum's Countdown, the ABC's nationally broadcast pop-music television show, AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia. Their performance on 3 April 1977 was their last live TV appearance for more than 20 years.[34]\\r\\nBrowning sent promo material to contacts in London, which came to the attention of Phil Carson of Atlantic Records. In 1976, the band signed an international deal with Atlantic Records. On arrival in London, their scheduled tour with Back Street Crawler was cancelled following the death of Paul Kossoff. As a result, they went back to playing smaller venues to build a local following until their label organized the \\"Lock Up Your Daughters\\" tour sponsored by Sounds magazine, the only major music magazine which was still relatively receptive to traditional rock music. At the time, punk rock was breaking out in London and came to dominate the pages of the major music weeklies, NME and Melody Maker. AC/DC were sometimes identified with the punk rock movement by the British press, however, in reality, they hated punk rock, believing it to be a passing fad ÿ according to manager Michael Browning \\"it wasn't possible to even hold a conversation with AC/DC about punk without them getting totally pissed off\\".[31] Their reputation, however, managed to survive the punk upheavals of the late 1970s, and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.[7] Angus Young gained notoriety for mooning the audience during live performances.\\r\\nThe first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the High Voltage and T.N.T. LPs. Also titled High Voltage, and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album has to date sold three million copies worldwide.[37][38] The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent T.N.T., and included only two songs from their first LP. The band's next album, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured the T.N.T. track \\"Rocker\\", which had previously not been released internationally. The original Australian version included \\"Jailbreak\\" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation EP '74 Jailbreak or as a live version on the 1992 Live album). Dirty Deeds was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.\\r\\nAfter a brief tour of Sweden, they returned to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the Marquee. However, their appearance at the 1976 Reading Festival failed to get a response from the crowd. They toured extensively throughout Europe, then returned to tour Australia in late 1976 to rebuild their finances and record the Let There Be Rock album.\\r\\nIn early 1977 they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, relations were less than cordial between the other members of the respective bands. In one incident, Geezer Butler pulled a knife on Malcolm Young.[39] Later in the year they toured with Rainbow.\\r\\nTowards the end of 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to find someone who could sing backup vocals.[8] Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor.[8] He was replaced by Cliff Williams.[8] Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, \\"You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy.\\"[22] Mark Evans' autobiography, DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.[40]\\r\\nAC/DC were a somewhat formative influence on new wave of British heavy metal bands who emerged in the late 1970s, such as Saxon and Iron Maiden, in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with Thin Lizzy, UFO, Scorpions, and Judas Priest, were among \\"the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned.\\"[41]\\r\\nAC/DC's first American exposure was through the Michigan radio station AM 600 WTAC in 1977. The station's manager, Peter C. Cavanaugh, booked the band to play at Flint's Capitol Theater. The supporting act was MC5, who had just briefly reunited and agreed to play at the event. The band opened with their popular song \\"Live Wire\\" and closed with \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\".[42] They gained invaluable experience of the stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as Aerosmith, Kiss, Styx, UFO, and Blue ?yster Cult, and co-headlined with Cheap Trick.[34]\\r\\nThe 1978 release of Powerage marked the debut of bassist Cliff Williams, and with its harder riffs, followed the blueprint set by Let There Be Rock.[43] Only one single was released from Powerage, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation/Sin City\\". An appearance at the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow during the Powerage tour was recorded and released as If You Want Blood You've Got It, featuring such songs as \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", \\"Problem Child\\", and \\"Let There Be Rock\\", as well as lesser-known album tracks like \\"Riff Raff\\". Powerage was the last album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young that had lead vocals by Bon Scott, and is claimed to be AC/DC's most under-rated album.[44]\\r\\nThe major breakthrough in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer \\"Mutt\\" Lange on the album Highway to Hell, released in 1979. Eddie Van Halen notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with Powerage.[45] It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the US top 100, eventually reaching No.?17,[34] and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.[7] Highway to Hell had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.[46] The final track, \\"Night Prowler\\", has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.[7]\\r\\nAs 1980 began, the band began work on a new album that would eventually become Back in Black, but Bon Scott would not live to see it finished. On 19 February 1980, Scott passed out in the car on the way back to friend Alistair Kinnear's house after a night of heavy drinking at the Music Machine club in London. Upon arrival at his home, Kinnear was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott late the next morning, Kinnear rushed him to King's College Hospital in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. Pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott's death,[47] and the official cause was listed as \\"acute alcohol poisoning\\".[48] Scott's family buried him in Fremantle, Western Australia, the area they emigrated to when he was a boy.[49]\\r\\nInconsistencies in the official accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.[48] Scott's asthma has also been cited as playing a role in his death,[50] but this has been challenged more recently.\\r\\nFollowing Scott's death the band briefly considered quitting, but encouraged by the insistence from Scott's parents that he would have wanted them to go on, they eventually decided to continue and went about finding a new frontman.[8] Various candidates were considered for his replacement, including: Buzz Shearman, ex-Moxy member, who was not able to join because of voice problems,[51] ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser and then Slade vocalist, Noddy Holder.[52] The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson.\\r\\nAngus Young later recalled, \\"I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him.\\"[53]\\r\\nFor the audition, Johnson sang \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" from Let There Be Rock and Ike & Tina Turner's \\"Nutbush City Limits\\".[24] He was hired a few days after the audition. With Johnson the band completed the songwriting that they had begun with Scott for the album Back in Black. Recording took place at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas a few months after Scott's death. Back in Black, produced by Mutt Lange and recorded by Tony Platt, became their biggest-selling album and a hard-rock landmark; hits include \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" and the title track. The album reached No.1 in the UK and No.4 in the US, where it spent 131 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart.[34]\\r\\nThe follow-up album, 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute You, also sold well and was positively received by critics. The album featured two of the band's most popular singles: \\"Let's Get It Up\\"[54] and the title track, \\"For Those About to Rock\\", which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively. The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, Flick of the Switch, in an effort to recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.[55]\\r\\nAfter having problems with drugs and alcohol,[57] drummer Phil Rudd's friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and eventually escalated to a physical confrontation after which Rudd was fired.[24] Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used, as Rudd had already completed his drum parts.[58] Rudd was replaced by Simon Wright in the summer of 1983 after the band held over 700 auditions in the US and UK.[59] Simon Kirke of Free and Bad Company fame, and Paul Thompson of Roxy Music were two of the drummers auditioned.[60]\\r\\nLater in the year, AC/DC released the self-produced album Flick of the Switch, which was less successful than their previous albums, and was considered underdeveloped and unmemorable.[55] One critic stated that the band \\"had made the same album nine times\\".[61] AC/DC were voted the eighth-biggest disappointment of the year in the 1984 Kerrang! readers' poll. However, Flick of the Switch eventually reached No. 4 on the UK charts,[24] and AC/DC had minor success with the singles \\"Nervous Shakedown\\" and \\"Flick of the Switch\\". Fly on the Wall, produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.[62] A music concept video of the same name featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.\\r\\nIn 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio \\"Who Made Who\\". The album Who Made Who was the soundtrack to Stephen King's film Maximum Overdrive;[44] it brought together older hits, such as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" and \\"Ride On\\", with newer songs such as title track \\"Who Made Who\\", and two new instrumentals, \\"D.T.\\" and \\"Chase the Ace\\".\\r\\nIn February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association's Hall of Fame.[63]\\r\\nAC/DC's 1988 album, Blow Up Your Video, was recorded at Studio Miraval in Le Val, France, and reunited the band with their original producers, Harry Vanda and George Young. The group recorded nineteen songs, choosing ten for the final release; though the album was later criticised for containing excessive \\"filler\\",[64] it was a commercial success. Blow Up Your Video sold more copies than the previous two studio releases combined, reaching No. 2 on the UK chartsAC/DC's highest position since \\"Back in Black\\" in 1980. The album featured the UK top-twenty single \\"Heatseeker\\"[54] and popular songs such as \\"That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll\\". The Blow Up Your Video World Tour began in February 1988, in Perth, Australia. That April, following live appearances across Europe, Malcolm Young announced that he was taking time off from touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, Stevie Young, temporarily took Malcolm's place.\\r\\nFollowing the tour, Wright left the group to work on the upcoming Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, and was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce,[24] so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through Rock or Bust in 2014.\\r\\nThe next album, The Razors Edge, was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser and produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. Released in 1990, it was a major comeback for the band, and included the hits \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\", which reached No. 5 and No. 16 respectively on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart, and \\"Moneytalks\\", which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[54] The album went multi-platinum and reached the US top ten. Several shows on the Razors Edge tour were recorded for the 1992 live album, titled Live. Live was produced by Fairbairn, and is considered one of the best live albums of the 1990s.[65] AC/DC headlined the Monsters of Rock show during this tour, which was released on DVD as Live at Donington. During The Razors Edge tour three fans were killed at a concert at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City, Utah in January 1991. When the concert began fans rushed the stage crushing the three and injuring others. It took 20 minutes before venue security and the group understood the severity of the situation and stopped the concert. AC/DC settled with the victims' families out of court. As a result of this incident, the Salt Palace eliminated festival seating from future events.[66][67] A year later, AC/DC recorded \\"Big Gun\\" for the soundtrack of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Last Action Hero, and was released as a single, reaching No. 1 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, the band's first No. 1 single on that chart.[34]\\r\\nIn 1994, Angus and Malcolm invited Rudd to several jam sessions. He was eventually rehired to replace Slade, whose amicable departure arose in part because of the band's strong desire to again work with Rudd. Recorded at the Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles by the reunited 1980ÿ83 line-up and produced by Rick Rubin, Ballbreaker was released in 1995. The first single from the album was \\"Hard as a Rock\\". Two more singles were released from the album: \\"Hail Caesar\\" and \\"Cover You in Oil\\".\\r\\nIn 1997, a box set named Bonfire was released. It contained four albums; a remastered version of Back in Black; Volts (a disc with alternate takes, outtakes, and stray live cuts) and two live albums, Live from the Atlantic Studios and Let There Be Rock: The Movie. Live from the Atlantic Studios was recorded on 7 December 1977 at the Atlantic Studios in New York. Let There Be Rock: The Movie was a double album recorded in 1979 at the Pavillon de Paris and was the soundtrack of a motion picture, AC/DC: Let There Be Rock. The US version of the box set included a colour booklet, a two-sided poster, a sticker, a temporary tattoo, a keychain bottle opener, and a guitar pick.[68]\\r\\nIn 2000, the band released Stiff Upper Lip, produced by brother George Young at the Warehouse Studio, again in Vancouver. The album was better received by critics than Ballbreaker but was considered lacking in new ideas.[69][70] The Australian release included a bonus disc with three promotional videos and several live performances recorded in Madrid, Spain in 1996. Stiff Upper Lip reached No.1 in five countries, including Argentina and Germany; No.2 in three countries, Spain, France and Switzerland; No.3 in Australia; No.5 in Canada and Portugal; and No.7 in Norway, the US and Hungary. The first single, \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", remained at No.1 on the US Mainstream Rock charts for four weeks.[34] The other singles released also did very well; \\"Satellite Blues\\" and \\"Safe in New York City\\" reached No.7 and No.31 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks, respectively.\\r\\nIn 2002, AC/DC signed a long-term, multi-album deal with Sony Music,[71] who went on to release a series of remastered albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series. Each release contained an expanded booklet featuring rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes.[72] In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip) was remastered and re-released. Ballbreaker was eventually re-released in October 2005; Stiff Upper Lip was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\r\\nOn 30 July 2003, the band performed with the Rolling Stones and Rush at Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto. The concert, held before an audience of half a million, was intended to help the city overcome the negative publicity stemming from the effects of a 2003 SARS epidemic. The concert holds the record for the largest paid music event in North American history.[73] The band came second in a list of Australia's highest-earning entertainers for 2005,[74] and sixth for 2006,[75] despite having neither toured since 2003 nor released an album since 2000. Verizon Wireless has gained the rights to release AC/DC's full albums and the entire Live at Donington concert to download in 2008.[76]\\r\\nOn 16 October 2007, Columbia Records released a double and triple DVD titled Plug Me In. The set consists of five and seven hours of rare footage, and even a recording of AC/DC at a high school performing \\"School Days\\", \\"TNT\\", \\"She's Got Balls\\", and \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\". As with Family Jewels, disc one contains rare shows of the band with Bon Scott, and disc two is about the Brian Johnson era. The collector's edition contains an extra DVD with 21 more rare performances of both Scott and Johnson and more interviews.[77]\\r\\nAC/DC made their video game debut on Rock Band 2, with \\"Let There Be Rock\\" included as a playable track.[78] The setlist from their Live at Donington live album was released as playable songs for the Rock Band series by means of a Wal-Mart-exclusive retail disc titled AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack.[79]\\r\\nNo Bull: The Directors Cut, a newly edited, comprehensive Blu-ray and DVD of the band's July 1996 Plaza De Toros de las Ventas concert in Madrid, Spain, was released on 9 September 2008.[80]\\r\\nOn 18 August 2008, Columbia Records announced 18 October Australian release, and 20 October worldwide release, of the studio album Black Ice. The 15-track album was the band's first studio release in eight years, was produced by Brendan O'Brien and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser. Like Stiff Upper Lip, it was recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia. Black Ice was sold in the US exclusively at Walmart and Sam's Club and the band's official website.[83]\\r\\n\\"Rock 'n' Roll Train\\", the album's first single, was released to radio on 28 August. On 15 August, AC/DC recorded a video for a song from the new album in London with a special selection of fans getting the chance to be in the video.[84] Black Ice debuted at No.1 on album charts in 29 countries and also was Columbia Records' biggest debut album (since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for Billboard in March 1991). Black Ice has been certified Multi Platinum in eight countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and the Czech Republic. Additionally Black Ice has achieved Platinum status in twelve countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, UK, Argentina, Singapore and New Zealand) and Gold status in four countries (The Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Brazil). The 18-month Black Ice World Tour supporting the new album was announced on 11 September and began on 28 October in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.[85]\\r\\nOn 15 September 2008, AC/DC Radio debuted on Sirius Channel 19 and XM channel 53. The channel plays AC/DC music along with interviews with the band members.[86]\\r\\nWith the North American release of Black Ice on 20 October 2008, Columbia Records and Walmart created \\"Rock Again AC/DC Stores\\" to promote the album. In October 2008, MTV, Walmart, and Columbia created \\"AC/DC Rock Band Stores\\" in New York City, at Times Square, and in Los Angeles. \\"Black Ice\\" trucks were also dispatched on the streets of these two cities after the release, playing AC/DC music aloud and making various stops each day to sell merchandise.[87]\\r\\nIn late September 2009, the band rescheduled six shows when Brian Johnson underwent an operation for ulcers.[88] On 29 September, the band announced a collection of studio and live rarities, Backtracks, which was released on 10 November 2009 as a 3-CD/2-DVD/1-LP box-set.[89]\\r\\nOn 4 November AC/DC were announced as the Business Review Weekly top Australian earner (entertainment) for 2009 with earnings of $105?million. This displaced The Wiggles from the number one spot for the first time in four years.[90]\\r\\nOn 19 April 2010, AC/DC released Iron Man 2, the soundtrack for the eponymous film which compiled earlier tracks from the band's studio albums.[91] One month later, the band headlined Download Festival at Donington Park,[92] and closed the Black Ice World Tour in Bilbao, Spain on 28 June 2010, after 20 months in which AC/DC went to 108 cities in over 28 countries, with an estimated audience of over five million people.[93] Three concerts in December 2009 at the River Plate Stadium in Argentina were released as the DVD Live at River Plate on 10 May 2011.[94] An exclusive single from the DVD, featuring the songs \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" and \\"War Machine\\", was issued on Record Store Day.[95] In 2011, the band also issued on DVD and Blu-ray the concert movie AC/DC: Let There Be Rock, which had its theatrical release in 1980.[96]\\r\\nAngus stated in an interview in early May 2011 that the band was beginning to plan another world tour, saying, \\"Now we're thinking, 'How can we ever better the 'Black Ice' world tour?' But we will.\\"[97] At the band's Live at River Plate DVD premiere on 6 May 2011 at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, England, Angus said that there were plans for the group to release a new studio album \\"within the next couple of years\\", which the tour would support.[98]\\r\\nIn May 2012, Malcolm Young confirmed that the band were working on a potential follow-up to 2008's Black Ice. But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, \\"You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while?ÿ a year or two anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working. But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more.\\"[99]\\r\\nOn 19 November 2012, AC/DC released Live at River Plate,[100] their first live album in 20 years.\\r\\nOn 16 April 2014, in response to earlier reports that the band may be retiring due to Malcolm Young being seriously ill and unable to perform,[101] Brian Johnson commented that AC/DC are not retiring, stating \\"We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We're going to pick up guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it.\\"[102] AC/DC subsequently announced in an official statement on their Facebook page that Malcolm Young would be taking a break from the band due to his ill health. It ended: \\"The band will continue to make music.\\"[103] In June, Johnson announced that AC/DC are \\"very likely\\" to be on the road again before the end of 2014.[104] In July 2014, AC/DC confirmed that they had finished recording their next album and that Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young replaced Malcolm in the studio.[105] Drummer Phil Rudd released his first solo album, Head Job, on 29 August 2014. He confirmed that there would be another AC/DC tour, and stated that the band had no intention of retiring, adding, \\"We'll all have to be dead before it stops.\\"[106] Malcolm died on 18 November 2017 at the age of 64.[107]\\r\\nOn 23 September 2014, Alberts management confirmed that founder member Malcolm Young had officially departed from the band and revealed that their new record entitled Rock or Bust featuring eleven new tracks would be released on 28 November 2014 as the first AC/DC album in the band's history without Malcolm Young on the recordings.[1] The band also announced plans for a world tour to promote the new album with Malcolm and Angus' nephew Stevie Young as Malcolm's replacement.[108]\\r\\nOn 6 November 2014 Rudd was charged with attempting to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home.[109][110] The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day, but the other charges remained.[111] AC/DC released a statement clarifying that the tour promoting Rock or Bust would continue, but did not say whether or not Rudd would participate, or if he was still a member of the band.[112]\\r\\nIn an interview on 13 November, Angus Young stated that the band had experienced problems with Rudd earlier in the year when recording Rock or Bust, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots, and with reference to Rudd's future in the band, Young added, \\"So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us.\\"[113] He also said the band would continue: \\"He's got to sort himself out I think?... At this point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way.\\"[114]\\r\\nAt the charity signing before the Grammy Awards, the band was photographed together with former drummer Chris Slade. It was later confirmed that he had rejoined the band for the Grammys and upcoming tour.[115] In April 2015, Rudd pleaded guilty to drug charges and threatening to kill a former assistant.[116] Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade.[117] On 9 July 2015 Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced to eight months' home detention.[118]\\r\\nOn 7 March 2016, the band announced that the final ten dates of the Rock or Bust World Tour would be rescheduled as Johnson's doctors had ordered him to stop touring immediately, as his hearing loss had accelerated and he risked complete deafness if he persisted on the road. The ten cancelled dates would be performed \\"likely with a guest vocalist\\" later in the year, leaving Johnson's future in touring with the group uncertain.[119] Johnson himself later stated on The Howard Stern Show that his hearing loss didn't come from having performed for 36 years with AC/DC, but rather his love of auto racing and having forgotten to put in ear plugs during one race that left him with a ruptured ear drum in his left ear.[120]\\r\\nHowever, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a friend of Johnson) revealed on his podcast that Johnson had received a second opinion on his hearing and it was not as bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour.[121] Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.[122]\\r\\nOn 19 April 2016, Johnson made an official statement regarding his health problems and inability to tour. In the statement, he acknowledged his ongoing hearing difficulties but stated his intentions to continue recording and potentially resume touring if his health improves sufficiently. He also specifically thanked Angus Young and Cliff Williams for their support during his AC/DC tenure.[123]\\r\\nOn 16 April 2016, AC/DC released a statement announcing the addition of Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose as the band's lead vocalist for the remainder of their 2016 tour dates. The statement reads: \\"AC/DC band members would like to thank Brian Johnson for his contributions and dedication to the band throughout the years. We wish him all the best with his hearing issues and future ventures. As much as we want this tour to end as it started, we understand, respect and support Brian's decision to stop touring and save his hearing. We are dedicated to fulfilling the remainder of our touring commitments to everyone that has supported us over the years, and are fortunate that Axl Rose has kindly offered his support to help us fulfill this commitment. AC/DC will resume their Rock or Bust World Tour with Axl Rose joining on vocals.\\"[124][125]\\r\\nOn 8 July 2016, Cliff Williams indicated he was retiring from the band in an interview with Gulfshore Life, saying \\"It's been what Ive known for the past 40 years, but after this tour Im backing off of touring and recording. Losing Malcolm, the thing with Phil and now with Brian, it's a changed animal. I feel in my gut it's the right thing.\\"[126] At the end of the Rock or Bust Tour he released a video statement confirming his retirement.[127]\\r\\nFollowing the band's final show with Williams on 21 September 2016 in Philadelphia it was reported that Axl Rose would be joining the band full-time and that he and Angus would continue AC/DC with different musicians.[128][129] Young's friend Angry Anderson said in a 2018 interview that Young intended to make a new album with Rose.[130]\\r\\nAC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2003.[131] During the ceremony the band performed \\"Highway to Hell\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", with guest vocals provided by host Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. He described the band's power chords as \\"the thunder from down under that gives you the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body.\\"[132] During the acceptance speech, Brian Johnson quoted their 1977 song \\"Let There Be Rock\\".[133]\\r\\nOn 22 March 2000, the municipality of Legans (near Madrid) named a street in honour of the band as \\"Calle de AC/DC\\" (\\"AC/DC Street\\"). Malcolm and Angus attended the inauguration with many fans. Later that day, the plaque with the name of the group was stolen, perhaps by an enthusiast or collector. The plaque was replaced two hours later, and stolen once again a mere three days after the fact. The plaque had since been stolen numerous times, forcing the municipality of Legans to begin selling replicas of the official street plaque.\\r\\nIn May 2003, the Young brothers accepted a Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Service to Australian Music at the 2003 Music Winners Awards, during which Malcolm paid special tribute to Bon Scott, who was also a recipient of the award.[134]\\r\\nOn 1 October 2004, a central Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed ACDC Lane in honour of the band. The City of Melbourne forbade the use of the slash character in street names, so the four letters were combined.[135] The lane is near Swanston Street where, on the back of a truck, the band recorded their video for the 1975 hit \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\".[35]\\r\\nThey sold over 1.3?million CDs in the US during 2007 despite not having released a new album since 2000 at that point. Additionally, the group's commercial success continues to flourish despite their choice to refrain from selling albums in digital online formats for many years.[136] However, in November 2012, the entire catalogue (excluding the TNT album and the Australian versions of the High Voltage, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and Let There Be Rock albums) became available on the iTunes Store.[137]\\r\\nIn 2009 the Recording Industry Association of America upgraded the group's US sales figures from 69?million to 71?million, making AC/DC the fifth-best-selling band in US history and the tenth-best-selling artist, selling more albums than Madonna and Mariah Carey.[10] The RIAA also certified Back in Black as double Diamond (20?million) in US sales, and by 2007 the album had sold 22?million copies, which made it the fifth-best-selling album of all-time in the US.[13]\\r\\nNote: Before their debut album, High Voltage (1975), AC/DC had several line up changes.

It is also fed during times when an animal is unable to access pasture, such as when animals are kept in a stable or barn.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommonly used plants for hay include mixtures of grasses such as ryegrass (Lolium species), timothy, brome, fescue, Bermuda grass, orchard grass, and other species, depending on region. Hay may also include legumes, such as alfalfa (lucerne) and clovers (red, white and subterranean). Legumes in hay are ideally cut pre-bloom. Other pasture forbs are also sometimes a part of the mix, though these plants are not necessarily desired as certain forbs are toxic to some animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOat, barley, and wheat plant materials are occasionally cut green and made into hay for animal fodder; however they are more usually used in the form of straw, a harvest byproduct where the stems and dead leaves are baled after the grain has been harvested and threshed. Straw is used mainly for animal bedding. Although straw is also used as fodder, particularly as a source of dietary fiber, it has lower nutritional value than hay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the leaf and seed material in the hay that determines its quality. Farmers try to harvest hay at the point when the seed heads are not quite ripe and the leaf is at its maximum when the grass is mowed in the field. The cut material is allowed to dry so that the bulk of the moisture is removed but the leafy material is still robust enough to be picked up from the ground by machinery and processed into storage in bales, stacks or pits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHay is very sensitive to weather conditions, especially when it is harvested. In drought conditions, both seed and leaf production are stunted, making hay that has a high ratio of dry coarse stems that have very low nutritional values. If the weather is too wet, the cut hay may spoil in the field before it can be baled. Thus the biggest challenge and risk for farmers in producing hay crops is the weather, especially the weather of the particular few weeks when the plants are at the best age/maturity for hay. A lucky break in the weather often moves the haymaking tasks (such as mowing, tedding, and baling) to the top priority on the farm's to-do list. This is reflected in the idiom to make hay while the sun shines. Hay that was too wet at cutting may develop rot and mold after being baled, creating the potential for toxins to form in the feed, which could make the animals sick. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter harvest, hay also has to be stored in a manner to prevent it from getting wet. Mold and spoilage reduce nutritional value and may cause illness in animals.  A symbiotic fungus in fescue may cause illness in horses and cattle.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe successful harvest of maximum yields of high-quality hay is entirely dependent on the coincident occurrence of optimum crop, field, and weather conditions. When this occurs, there may be a period of intense activity on the hay farm while harvest proceeds until weather conditions become unfavourable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHay or grass is the foundation of the diet for all grazing animals and can provide as much as 100% of the fodder required for an animal. Hay is usually fed to an animal in place of allowing the animal to graze on grasses in a pasture, particularly in the winter or during times when drought or other conditions make pasture unavailable. Animals that can eat hay vary in the types of grasses suitable for consumption, the ways they consume hay, and how they digest it. Therefore, different types of animals require hay that consists of similar plants to what they would eat while grazing, and likewise, plants that are toxic to an animal in pasture are also toxic if they are dried into hay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost animals are fed hay in two daily feedings, morning and evening. However, this schedule is more for the convenience of humans, as most grazing animals on pasture naturally consume fodder in multiple feedings throughout the day. Some animals, especially those being raised for meat, may be given enough hay that they simply are able to eat all day. Other animals, especially those that are ridden or driven as working animals, are only free to eat when not working, and may be given a more limited amount of hay to prevent them from getting too fat. The proper amount of hay and the type of hay required varies somewhat between different species.  Some animals are also fed concentrated feeds such as grain or vitamin supplements in addition to hay. In most cases, hay or pasture forage must make up 50% or more of the diet by weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most significant differences in hay digestion is between ruminant animals, such as cattle and sheep; and nonruminant, hindgut fermentors, such as horses. Both types of animals can digest cellulose in grass and hay, but do so by different mechanisms. Because of the four-chambered stomach of cattle, they are often able to break down older forage and have more tolerance of mold and changes in diet.  The single-chambered stomach and cecum or \\"hindgut\\" of the horse uses bacterial processes to break down cellulose that are more sensitive to changes in feeds and the presence of mold or other toxins, requiring horses to be fed hay of a more consistent type and quality.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent animals also use hay in different ways: cattle evolved to eat forages in relatively large quantities at a single feeding, and then, due to the process of rumination, take a considerable amount of time for their stomachs to digest food, often accomplished while the animal is lying down, at rest. Thus quantity of hay is important for cattle, who can effectively digest hay of low quality if fed in sufficient amounts.  Sheep will eat between two and four percent of their body weight per day in dry feed, such as hay,[3] and are very efficient at obtaining the most nutrition possible from three to five pounds per day of hay or other forage.[4] They require three to four hours per day to eat enough hay to meet their nutritional requirements.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike ruminants, horses digest food in small portions throughout the day, and can only use approximately 2.5% of their body weight in feed in any 24-hour period. They evolved to be continuously on the move while grazing, (covering up to 50 miles (80?km) per day in the wild) and their stomach digests food quite rapidly. Thus, they extract more nutrition out of smaller quantities of feed.[6] However, when horses are fed low-quality hay, they may develop an unhealthy, obese, \\"hay belly\\" due to over-consumption of \\"empty\\" calories. If their type of feed is changed dramatically, or if they are fed moldy hay or hay containing toxic plants, they can become ill; colic is the leading cause of death in horses. Contaminated hay can also lead to respiratory problems in horses. Hay can be soaked in water, sprinkled with water or subjected to steaming to reduce dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nHay production and harvest, colloquially known as \\"making hay\\",[7] \\"haymaking\\", or \\"doing hay\\", involves a multiple step process: cutting, drying or \\"curing\\", raking, processing, and storing. Hayfields do not have to be reseeded each year in the way that grain crops are, but regular fertilizing is usually desirable, and overseeding a field every few years helps increase yield.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods and the terminology to describe the steps of making hay have varied greatly throughout history, and many regional variations still exist today. However, whether done by hand or by modern mechanized equipment, tall grass and legumes at the proper stage of maturity must be cut, then allowed to dry (preferably by the sun), then raked into long, narrow piles known as windrows. Next, the cured hay is gathered up in some form (usually by some type of baling process) and placed for storage into a haystack or into a barn or shed to protect it from moisture and rot.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the growing season, which is spring and early summer in temperate climates, grass grows at a fast pace. It is at its greatest nutritive value when all leaves are fully developed and seed or flower heads are just a bit short of full maturity. When growth is at a maximum in the pasture or field, if judged correctly, it is cut. Grass hay cut too early will not cure as easily due to high moisture content, plus it will produce a lower yield per acre than longer, more mature grass. But hay cut too late is coarser, lower in resale value and has lost some of its nutrients. There is usually about a two-week \\"window\\" of time in which grass is at its ideal stage for harvesting hay. The time for cutting alfalfa hay is ideally done when plants reach maximum height and are producing flower buds or just beginning to bloom, cutting during or after full bloom results in lower nutritional value of the hay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHay can be raked into rows as it is cut, then turned periodically to dry, particularly if a modern swather is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread out in the field until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a hay rake or spreading it out with a tedder. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a hay conditioner, or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed evaporation of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce hay is cut, dried and raked into windrows, it is usually gathered into bales or bundles, then hauled to a central location for storage. In some places, depending on geography, region, climate, and culture, hay is gathered loose and stacked without being baled first.\\r\\n\\r\\nHay must be fully dried when baled and kept dry in storage. If hay is baled while too moist or becomes wet while in storage, there is a significant risk of spontaneous combustion.[9] Hay stored outside must be stacked in such a way that moisture contact is minimal. Some stacks are arranged in such a manner that the hay itself \\"sheds\\" water when it falls. Other methods of stacking use the first layers or bales of hay as a cover to protect the rest. To completely keep out moisture, outside haystacks can also be covered by tarps, and many round bales are partially wrapped in plastic as part of the baling process. Hay is also stored under a roof when resources permit. It is frequently placed inside sheds, or stacked inside of a barn. On the other hand, care must also be taken that hay is never exposed to any possible source of heat or flame, as dry hay and the dust it produces are highly flammable.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly farmers noticed that growing fields produced more fodder in the spring than the animals could consume, and that cutting the grass in the summer, allowing it to dry and storing it for the winter provided their domesticated animals with better quality nutrition than simply allowing them to dig through snow in the winter to find dried grass. Therefore, some fields were \\"shut up\\" for hay.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to the end of the 19th century, grass and legumes were not often grown together because crops were rotated.[citation needed] However, by the 20th century, good forage management techniques demonstrated that highly productive pastures were a mix of grasses and legumes, so compromises were made when it was time to mow. Later still, some farmers grew crops, like straight alfalfa (lucerne), for special-purpose hay such as that fed to dairy cattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch hay was originally cut by scythe by teams of workers, dried in the field and gathered loose on wagons. Later, haying would be done by horse-drawn implements such as mowers. With the invention of agricultural machinery such as the tractor and the baler, most hay production became mechanized by the 1930s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hay was cut and had dried, the hay was raked or rowed up by raking it into a linear heap by hand or with a horse-drawn implement. Turning hay, when needed, originally was done by hand with a fork or rake. Once the dried hay was rowed up, pitch forks were used to pile it loose, originally onto a horse-drawn cart or wagon, later onto a truck or tractor-drawn trailer, for which a sweep could be used instead of pitch forks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoose hay was taken to an area designated for storageusually a slightly raised area for drainageand built into a hay stack. The stack was made waterproof as it was built (a skilled task) and the hay would compress under its own weight and cure by the release of heat from the residual moisture in the hay and from the compression forces. The stack was fenced from the rest of the paddock in a rick yard, and often thatched or sheeted to keep it dry. When needed, slices of hay would be cut using a hay knife and fed out to animals each day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn some farms the loose hay was stored in a barrack, shed, or barn, normally in such a way that it would compress down and cure. Hay could be stored in a specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the hay loft. Alternatively, an upper storey of a cow-shed or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into hay-racks below.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on region, the term \\"hay rick\\" could refer to the machine for cutting hay, the hay stack or the wagon used to collect the hay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHay baling began with the invention of the first hay press in about 1850.[10]   Hay was baled for easier handling and to reduce space required for storage and shipment.  The first bales weighed about 300 lb.  The original machines were of the vertical design similar to the one photographed by Greene Co. Historical Society.  They used a horse driven screw press mechanism or a dropped weight to compress the hay.  The first patent went to HL Emery for a horse powered, screw operated hay press in 1853.  Other models were reported as early as 1843 built by PK Dedericks Sons of Albany, NY, or Samuel Hewitt of Switzerland County, Ohio.[11]  Later horizontal machines were devised.  One was the Perpetual Press made by PK Dederick of Albany, NY, in 1872.  They could be powered by steam engines by about 1882.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreene County (NY) Historical Society reports[12]: The harvest of hay for the urban market was a major factor in Greene Countys early economy and a hay press was essential to this process.  In 1900, there were 130,000 horses in Manhattan, each one eating fifteen to twenty pounds of hay daily.  This resulted in 400,000 tons of hay, much of it from Greene County being shipped to the city at the turn of the 20th Century.  About 15 presses existed in the Coxsackie ÿ New Baltimore area.  Theirs will be the only one on display in eastern New York and New England.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1865 to 1914, most baled hay was stacked out of doors and covered with tarpaulins.  The continuous hay baler arrived in 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern mechanized hay production today is usually performed by a number of machines. While small operations use a tractor to pull various implements for mowing and raking, larger operations use specialized machines such as a mower or a swather, which are designed to cut the hay and arrange it into a windrow in one step. Balers are usually pulled by a tractor, with larger balers requiring more powerful tractors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMobile balers, machines which gather and bale hay in one process, were first developed around 1940. The first balers produced rectangular bales small enough for a person to lift, usually between 70 and 100 pounds (32 and 45?kg) each. The size and shape made it possible for people to pick bales up, stack them on a vehicle for transport to a storage area, then build a haystack by hand. However, to save labor and increase safety, loaders and stackers were also developed to mechanise the transport of small bales from the field to the haystack. Later in the 20th century, balers were developed capable of producing large bales that weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,400?kg).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nConditioning of hay has become popular. The basic idea is that it decreases drying time, particularly in humid climates or if rain interferes with haying. Usually, a salt solution is sprayed over the top of the hay (generally alfalfa) that helps to dry the hay. Conditioning can also refer to the rollers inside a swather that crimps the alfalfa to help squeeze out the moisture.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern hay production often relies on artificial fertilizer and herbicides. Traditionally, manure has been used on hayfields, but modern chemical fertilizers are used today as well. Hay that is to be certified as weed-free for use in wilderness areas must often be sprayed with chemical herbicides to keep unwanted weeds from the field, and sometimes even non-certified hayfields are sprayed to limit the production of noxious weeds. However, organic forms of fertilization and weed control are required for hay grown for consumption by animals whose meat will ultimately be certified organic. To that end, compost and field rotation can enhance soil fertility, and regular mowing of fields in the growth phase of the hay will often reduce the prevalence of undesired weeds. In recent times, some producers have experimented with human sewage sludge to grow hay. This is not a certified organic method and no warning labels are mandated by EPA.[14] One concern with hay grown on human sewage sludge is that the hay can take up heavy metals, which are then consumed by animals.[15] Molybdenum poisoning is a particular concern in ruminants such as cows and goats, and there have been animal deaths.[16][17][18] Another concern is with a herbicide known as aminopyralid, which can pass through the digestive tract in animals, making their resulting manure toxic to many plants and thus unsuitable as fertilizer for food crops.[19] Aminopyralid and related herbicides can persist in the environment for several years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall bales are still produced today. While balers for small bales are still manufactured, as well as loaders and stackers, there are some farms that still use equipment manufactured over 50 years ago, kept in good repair. The small bale remains part of overall ranch lore and tradition with \\"hay bucking\\" competitions still held for fun at many rodeos and county fairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall square bales are stacked in a criss-crossed fashion sometimes called a \\"rick\\" or \\"hayrick\\". Rain tends to wash nutrition out of hay and can cause spoilage or mold. Hay in small square bales is particularly susceptible to this, and is therefore often stored in a hayshed or protected by tarpaulins. If this is not done, the top two layers of the stack are often lost to rot and mold, and if the stack is not arranged in a proper hayrick, moisture can seep even deeper into the stack. The rounded shape and tighter compaction of small (and large) round bales makes them less susceptible to spoilage, as the water is less likely to penetrate into the bale. The addition of net wrap, which is not used on square bales, offers even greater weather resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who keep small numbers of animals may prefer small bales that can be handled by one person without machinery. There is also a risk that hay bales may be moldy, or contain decaying carcasses of small creatures that were accidentally killed by baling equipment and swept up into the bale, which can produce toxins such as botulism. Both can be deadly to non-ruminant herbivores, such as horses, and when this occurs, the entire contaminated bale generally is thrown out, another reason some people continue to support the market for small bales.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmers who need to make large amounts of hay are likely to choose balers which produce much larger bales, maximizing the amount of hay which is protected from the elements. Large bales come in two types, round and square. Large square bales, which can weigh up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200?lb), can be stacked and are easier to transport on trucks. Large round bales, which typically weigh 300?to 400 kilograms (660ÿ880?lb), are more moisture-resistant, and pack the hay more densely (especially at the center). Round bales are quickly fed with the use of mechanized equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratio of volume to surface area makes it possible for many dry-area farmers to leave large bales outside until they are consumed. Wet-area farmers and those in climates with heavy snowfall can stack round bales under a shed or tarp, but can also use a light but durable plastic wrap that partially encloses bales left outside. The wrap repels moisture, but leaves the ends of the bale exposed so that the hay itself can \\"breathe\\" and does not begin to ferment. However, when it is possible to store round bales under a shed, they last longer and less hay is lost to rot and moisture.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor animals that eat silage, a bale wrapper may be used to seal a round bale completely and trigger the fermentation process. It is a technique used as a money-saving process by producers who do not have access to a silo, and for producing silage that is transported to other locations. However, a silo is still a preferred method for making silage.[21] In very damp climates, it is a legitimate alternative to drying hay completely and when processed properly, the natural fermentation process prevents mold and rot. Round bale silage is also sometimes called \\"haylage\\", and is seen more commonly in Europe than in either the United States or Australia. However, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to spoilage.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaystacks are stacks of harvested hay, stacked in many different ways, depending upon region of the world, climate, if baled or loose, and so on.  Hay requires protection from weather, and is optimally stored inside buildings or other structures, but haystacks are also built in an open field.  A fence may be built to enclose a haystack and prevent roaming animals from eating it,[23][24] or animals may feed directly from a field-constructed stack as part of their winter feeding.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaystacks are also called haycocks in some dialects of English. The words are usually styled as solid compounds, but not always. They are also sometimes called stooks, shocks, or ricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoose stacks are built to prevent accumulation of moisture and promote drying, or curing. In some places, this is accomplished by constructing stacks with a conical or ridged top.[23][26] The exterior may look gray on the surface after weathering, but the inner hay retains traces of its fresh-cut aroma and maintains a faded green tint.[23] They can be covered with thatch,[26][27] or kept within a protective structure. One such structure is a moveable roof supported by four posts, historically called a Dutch roof, hay barrack, or hay cap.[27][28] Haystacks may also be built on top of a foundation laid on the ground to reduce spoilage, in some places made of wood or brush.[23] In other areas, hay is stacked loose, built around a central pole, a tree, or within an area of three or four poles to add stability to the stack.[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne loose hay stacking technique seen in the British isles is to initially stack freshly cut hay into smaller mounds called foot cocks, hay coles, kyles, hayshocks or haycocks, to facilitate initial curing.[23][32] These are sometimes built atop platforms or tripods formed of three poles, used to keep hay off the ground and let air into the center for better drying.[33] The shape causes dew and rain water roll down the sides, allowing the hay within to cure.[23] People who handle the hay may use hayforks or pitchforks to move or pitch the hay in building haycocks and haystacks.[23][34] Construction of tall haystacks is sometimes aided with a ramp, ranging from simple poles to a device for building large loose stacks called a beaverslide.[23][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer's lung (not to be confused with silo-filler's disease) is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by the inhalation of biologic dusts coming from hay dust or mold spores or other agricultural products.[36] Exposure to hay can also trigger Allergic rhinitis for people who are hypersensitive to airborne allergens.\\r\\n\\r\\nHay baled before it is fully dry can produce enough heat to start a fire.  Haystacks produce internal heat due to bacterial fermentation. If hay is stacked with wet grass, the heat produced can be sufficient to ignite the hay causing a fire. Farmers have to be careful about moisture levels to avoid spontaneous combustion, which is a leading cause of haystack fires.[37] Heat is produced by the respiration process, which occurs until the moisture content of drying hay drops below 40%. Hay is considered fully dry when it reaches 20% moisture. Combustion problems typically occur within five days to seven days of baling. A bale cooler than 120?F (49?C) is in little danger, but bales between 120 and 140?F (49 and 60?C) need to be removed from a barn or structure and separated so that they can cool off. If the temperature of a bale exceeds more than 140?F (60?C), it can combust.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to its weight, hay can cause a number of injuries to humans, particularly those related to lifting and moving bales, as well as risks related to stacking and storing. Hazards include the danger of having a poorly constructed stack collapse, causing either falls to people on the stack or injuries to people on the ground who are struck by falling bales. Large round hay bales present a particular danger to those who handle them, because they can weigh over 1,000 pounds (450?kg) and cannot be moved without special equipment. Nonetheless, because they are cylindrical in shape, and thus can roll easily, it is not uncommon for them to fall from stacks or roll off the equipment used to handle them.  From 1992 to 1998, 74 farm workers in the United States were killed in large round hay bale accidents, usually when bales were being moved from one location to another, such as when feeding animals.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nHay is generally one of the safest feeds to provide to domesticated grazing herbivores. However, some precautions are needed. Amount must be monitored so that animals do not get too fat or too thin. Supplemental feed may be required for working animals with high energy requirements. Animals who eat spoiled hay may develop a variety of illnesses, from coughs related to dust and mold, to various other illnesses, the most serious of which may be botulism, which can occur if a small animal, such as a rodent or snake, is killed by the baling equipment, then rots inside the bale, causing a toxin to form. Some animals are sensitive to particular fungi or molds that may grow on living plants. For example, an endophytic fungus that sometimes grows on fescue can cause abortion in pregnant mares.[41] Some plants themselves may also be toxic to some animals. For example, Pimelea, a native Australian plant, also known as flax weed, is highly toxic to cattle.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\noids\\r\\n\\r\\nFiber\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Hay at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What are the big rolls of hay called?"},{"output":"\\"that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin.\\"","context":"The Immaculate Conception is the conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary free from original sin by virtue of the merits of her son Jesus Christ. The Catholic Church teaches that God acted upon Mary in the first moment of her conception keeping her \\"immaculate\\".[1]\\r\\nThe Immaculate Conception is commonly confused with the Virgin Birth of Jesus. Jesus' birth is covered by the Doctrine of Incarnation, while the Immaculate Conception deals with the conception of Mary, not that of her son.\\r\\nAlthough the belief that Mary was sinless, or conceived without original sin, has been widely held since Late Antiquity, the doctrine was not dogmatically defined until 1854, by Pope Pius IX in his papal bull Ineffabilis Deus.[2] The Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8; in many Catholic countries, it is a holy day of obligation or patronal feast, and in some a national public holiday.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defined dogma of the Immaculate Conception regards original sin only, saying that Mary was preserved from any stain (in Latin, macula or labes, the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition).[4] The proclaimed Roman Catholic dogma states, \\"that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin.\\"[4] Therefore, being always free from original sin, the doctrine teaches that from her conception Mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth.\\r\\nThe definition makes no declaration about the Church's belief that the Blessed Virgin was sinless in the sense of freedom from actual or personal sin.[5] However, the Church holds that Mary was also sinless personally, \\"free from all sin, original or personal\\".[6] The Council of Trent decreed: \\"If anyone shall say that a man once justified can sin no more, nor lose grace, and that therefore he who falls and sins was never truly justified; or, on the contrary, that throughout his whole life he can avoid all sins even venial sins, except by a special privilege of God, as the Church holds in regard to the Blessed Virgin: let him be anathema.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe doctrine of the immaculate conception (Mary being conceived free from original sin) is not to be confused with the virginal conception of her son Jesus. This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media. Catholics believe that Mary was conceived of both parents[8] traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. In 1677, the Holy See condemned the error of Imperiali who taught that St. Anne in the conception and birth of Mary remained virgin which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century.[9] The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (when Mary was conceived free from original sin) on 8 December, exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary. The feast of the Annunciation (which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus) is celebrated on 25 March, nine months before Christmas Day.[10][11]\\r\\nAnother misunderstanding is that, by her immaculate conception, Mary did not need a saviour. When defining the dogma in Ineffabilis Deus, Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime. He stated that Mary, rather than being cleansed after sin, was completely prevented from contracting Original Sin in view of the foreseen merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race. In Luke 1:47, Mary proclaims: \\"My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.\\" This is referred to as Mary's pre-redemption by Christ. Since the Second Council of Orange against semi-pelagianism, the Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless, he would still require God's grace to remain sinless.[12][13]\\r\\nA feast of the Conception of the Most Holy and All Pure Mother of God was celebrated in Syria on 8 December perhaps as early as the 5th century. Note that the title of achrantos (spotless, immaculate, all-pure) refers to the holiness of Mary, not specifically to the holiness of her conception.[14]\\r\\nMary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory.[16] Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.[17] Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas[18] and Joseph Bryennius).[19]\\r\\nIt is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\".[20] But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).[5]\\r\\nAlthough the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians,[21] it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \\"prepurified\\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem.[22] In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \\"purified\\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \\"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero.[23] Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \\"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them.\\" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan.[24] The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's \\"pre purification\\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the \\"all pure seed\\" of Joachim and the womb \\"wider than heaven\\" of St. Ann.[25]\\r\\nBernard of Clairvaux in the 12th century raised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of Lyon for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless. It is doubtful, however, whether he was using the term \\"conception\\" in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: \\"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (libido)?\\" and stronger expressions follow, showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child.[5]\\r\\nSaint Thomas Aquinas refused to concede the Immaculate Conception, on the ground that, unless the Blessed Virgin had at one time or other been one of the sinful, she could not justly be said to have been redeemed by Christ.[26]\\r\\nSaint Bonaventure (d. 1274), second only to Saint Thomas in his influence on the Christian schools of his age, hesitated to accept it for a similar reason.[5] He believed that Mary was completely free from sin, but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception.[27]\\r\\nThe celebrated John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered.[5] Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history.[28]\\r\\nThe arguments of Scotus, combined with a better acquaintance with the language of the early Fathers, gradually prevailed in the schools of the Western Church. In 1387 the university of Paris strongly condemned the opposite view.[5]\\r\\nScotus's arguments remained controversial, however, particularly among the Dominicans, who were willing enough to celebrate Mary's sanctificatio (being made free from sin) but, following the Dominican Thomas Aquinas' arguments, continued to insist that her sanctification could not have occurred until after her conception.[20]\\r\\nPopular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary's conception. In 1439, the Council of Basel, which is not reckoned an ecumenical council, stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith.[29] By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \\"Doctor Angelicus\\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545ÿ63)which might have been expected to affirm the doctrineinstead declined to take a position.[20][30]\\r\\nThe papal bull defining the dogma, Ineffabilis Deus (1854), mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him. It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary's \\"wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence\\" \\"in that ark of Noah, which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven, by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended, and on whose top the Lord himself leaned;[31] in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides, which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully;[32] in that impregnable tower before the enemy, from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong;[33] in that garden enclosed on all sides, which cannot be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots;[34] in that resplendent city of God, which has its foundations on the holy mountains;[35] in that most august temple of God, which, radiant with divine splendours, is full of the glory of God;[36] and in very many other biblical types of this kind.\\"\\r\\nThe bull recounts that the Fathers interpreted the angel's address to Mary, \\"highly favoured one\\" or \\"full of grace\\",[37] as indicating that \\"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction\\"; they \\"frequently compare her to Eve while yet a virgin, while yet innocence, while yet incorrupt, while not yet deceived by the deadly snares of the most treacherous serpent\\".\\r\\nThe theological underpinnings of Immaculate Conception had been the subject of debate during the Middle Ages with opposition provided by figures such as Saint Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican. However, supportive arguments by Franciscans William of Ware and Duns Scotus, and general belief among Catholics made the doctrine more acceptable, so that the Council of Basel supported it in the 15th century, but the Council of Trent sidestepped the question. Pope Sixtus IV, a Franciscan, had tried to pacify the situation by forbidding either side from criticizing each other, and placed the feast of the Immaculate Conception on the Roman Calendar in 1477, but Pope Pius V, a Dominican, changed it to the feast of the Conception of Mary. Clement XI made the feast universal in 1708, but still did not call it the feast of the Immaculate Conception.[38] Popular and theological support for the concept continued to grow and by the 18th century it was widely depicted in art.[39][40][41][42]\\r\\nDuring the reign of Pope Gregory XVI the bishops in various countries began to press for a definition as dogma of the teaching of Mary's immaculate conception.[43]\\r\\nIn 1839 Mariano Spada (1796 - 1872), professor of theology at the Roman College of Saint Thomas, published Esame Critico sulla dottrina dell Angelico Dottore S. Tommaso di Aquino circa il Peccato originale, relativamente alla Beatissima Vergine Maria [A critical examination of the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor, regarding original sin with respect to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary],[44] in which Aquinas is interpreted not as treating the question of the Immaculate Conception later formulated in the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus but rather the sanctification of the fetus within Mary's womb. Spada furnished an interpretation whereby Pius IX was relieved of the problem of seeming to foster a doctrine not in agreement with the Aquinas' teaching.[45] Pope Pius IX would later appoint Spada Master of the Sacred Palace in 1867.\\r\\nPius IX, at the beginning of his pontificate, and again after 1851, appointed commissions to investigate the whole subject, and he was advised that the doctrine was one which could be defined and that the time for a definition was opportune.\\r\\nIt was not until 1854 that Pope Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted between 1851ÿ1853, promulgated the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus (Latin for \\"Ineffable God\\"), which defined ex cathedra the dogma of the Immaculate Conception:[46]\\r\\nWe declare, pronounce and define that the doctrine which holds that the Blessed Virgin Mary, at the first instant of her conception, by a singular privilege and grace of the Omnipotent God, in virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, was preserved immaculate from all stain of original sin, has been revealed by God, and therefore should firmly and constantly be believed by all the faithful.\\r\\nThe dogma was defined in accordance with the conditions of papal infallibility, which would be defined in 1870 by the First Vatican Council.\\r\\nThe papal definition of the dogma declares with absolute certainty and authority that Mary possessed sanctifying grace from the first instant of her existence and was free from the lack of grace caused by the original sin at the beginning of human history. Mary's salvation was won by her son Jesus Christ through his passion, death, and resurrection and was not due to her own merits.[30][48]\\r\\nFor the Roman Catholic Church the dogma of the Immaculate Conception gained additional significance from the reputed apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes in 1858. At Lourdes a 14-year-old girl, Bernadette Soubirous, claimed that a beautiful woman appeared to her and said, \\"I am the Immaculate Conception\\". Many believe the woman to have been the Blessed Virgin Mary and pray to her as such.[49]\\r\\nPope Pius IX defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception \\"not so much because of proofs in Scripture or ancient tradition, but due to a profound sensus fidelium and the Magisterium\\".[50]\\r\\nSpeaking of the witness of the Church Fathers in claiming for Mary titles such as \\"Free from all contagion of sin\\", Pope Pius XII wrote:\\r\\nIf the popular praises of the Blessed Virgin Mary be given the careful consideration they deserve, who will dare to doubt that she, who was purer than the angels and at all times pure, was at any moment, even for the briefest instant, not free from every stain of sin?[51]\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic tradition has a well-established philosophy for the study of the Immaculate Conception and the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the field of Mariology, with Pontifical schools such as the Marianum specifically devoted to this.[52][53]\\r\\nAccording to Bernard Ullathorne, a 19th-century English Roman Catholic prelate, \\"the expressions - The Immaculate Conception - The Immaculate Preservation - The Immunity - and Exception from original sin, are all phrases which bear the same signification, and are used equally to express one and the same mystery.\\"[54]\\r\\nA number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception by pontifical decree.\\r\\nThese include Argentina, Brazil, Korea, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Philippines, Spain (old kingdoms and the present state), the United States and Uruguay.\\r\\nBy royal decree under the House of Braganza, it is the principal Patroness of Portugal.\\r\\nBy 750, the feast of her conception (December 8th) was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East, under the name of the Conception (active) of Saint Anne. In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception (passive) of Mary, and was associated particularly with the Normans, whether these introduced it directly from the East[55] or took it from English usage.[56] The spread of the feast, by now with the adjective \\"Immaculate\\" attached to its title, met opposition on the part of some, on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception.[20] Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux, Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas. Other theologians defended the expression \\"Immaculate Conception\\", pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of Christ, a view held especially by Franciscans.[57]\\r\\nWilliam of Ware and Blessed John Duns Scotus pointed out that Marys Immaculate Conception enhances Jesus redemptive work.[58] One of the chief proponents of the doctrine was the Hungarian Franciscan Pelbartus Ladislaus of Temesvr. [59]\\r\\nOn 28 February 1476, Pope Sixtus IV, authorized those dioceses that wished to introduce the feast to do so, and introduced it to his own diocese of Rome in 1477,[56] with a specially composed Mass and Office of the feast.[60] With his bull Cum praeexcelsa of 28 February 1477, in which he referred to the feast as that of the Conception of Mary, without using the word \\"Immaculate\\", he granted indulgences to those who would participate in the specially composed Mass or Office on the feast itself or during its octave, and he used the word \\"immaculate\\" of Mary, but applied instead the adjective \\"miraculous\\" to her conception.[61][62] On 4 September 1483, referring to the feast as that of \\"the Conception of Immaculate Mary ever Virgin\\", he condemned both those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that the \\"glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived without the stain of original sin\\" and those who called it mortally sinful and heretical to hold that \\"the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived with original sin\\", since, he said, \\"up to this time there has been no decision made by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See.\\"[61] This decree was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent.[61]\\r\\nPope Pius V, while including the feast in the Tridentine Calendar, removed the adjective \\"Immaculate\\" and suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word \\"Nativity\\" replaced by \\"Conception\\") be used instead.[63][64] Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that Pope Pius IX ordered to be used on the feast and that is still in use.[65]\\r\\nOn 6 December 1708, Pope Clement XI made the feast of the Conception of Mary, at that time still with the Nativity of Mary formula for the Mass, a Holy Day of Obligation.[20] Until Pope Pius X reduced in 1911 the number of Holy Days of Obligation to 8, there were in the course of the year 36 such days, apart from Sundays.[66] Writers such as Sarah Jane Boss interpret the existence of the feast as a strong indication of the Church's traditional belief in the Immaculate Conception.[67]\\r\\nFor differing reasons, belief in Mary's immaculate conception in the Catholic doctrinal form is not part of the official doctrines of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican and Protestant churches.\\r\\nContemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the dogmatic declaration of her immaculate conception as an \\"over-elaboration\\" of the faith and because they see it as too closely connected with a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin.[68] All the same, the historical and authentic tradition of Mariology in Byzantium took its historical point of departure from Sophronios, Damascene, and their imitators. The most famous Eastern Orthodox theologian to imply Mary's Immaculate Conception was St. Gregory Palamas. Though many passages from his works were long known to extol and attribute to Mary a Christlike holiness in her human nature, traditional objections to Palamas' disposition toward the Immaculate Conception typically rely on a poor understanding of his doctrine of \\"the purification of Mary\\" at the Annunciation.[69] Not only did he explicitly cite St. Gregory Nazianzen for his understanding of Jesus' purification at His baptism and Mary's at the Annunciation, but Theophanes of Nicaea, Joseph Bryennius, and Gennadios Scholarios all explicitly placed Mary's Conception as the first moment of her all-immaculate participation in the divine energies to such a degree that she was always completely without spot and graced.[70] In addition to Emperor Manuel II and Gennadius Scholarius, St. Mark of Ephesus also fervently defended Mary's title as \\"prepurified\\" against the Dominican, Manuel Calecas, who was perhaps promoting thomistic Mariology that denied Mary's all-holiness from the first moment of her existence.[71]\\r\\nIn the tradition of Ethiopian Orthodoxy, the Kebra Nagast says:\\r\\nHe cleansed EVE'S body and sanctified it and made for it a dwelling in her for ADAM'S salvation. She [i.e., MARY] was born without blemish, for He made her pure, without pollution, and she redeemed his debt without carnal union and embrace ... Through the transgression of EVE we died and were buried, and by the purity of MARY we receive honour, and are exalted to the heights.\\r\\nWhile Old Catholics do not reject the Immaculate Conception of Mary, and some of their parishes venerate Mary as immaculately conceived and celebrate the feast of her Immaculate Conception, they do not accept its definition as a dogma, since they reject papal infallibility and with it the Pope's authority to define dogma.[73]\\r\\nMartin Luther, who initiated the Protestant Reformation, said: \\"Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became the mother of a pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person.\\"[74] Some Lutherans, such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, support the doctrine.\\r\\nMost Protestants reject the doctrine because they do not consider the development of dogmatic theology to be authoritative apart from biblical exegesis, and because the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is not taught in the Bible.[75] The formal pronouncement of Mary's Immaculate Conception by the Catholic Church in 1854 further alienated some Protestant churches largely due to its implication that not all have sinned.[76]\\r\\nBelief in Mary's immaculate conception is not a doctrine within Anglicanism, although it is shared by many Anglo-Catholics.[77] In the Church of England's Common Worship prayer book, 8 December is designated a Lesser Festival of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary (without the adjective \\"immaculate\\").[78]\\r\\nThe report \\"Mary: Faith and Hope in Christ\\", by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, concluded that the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions.[79] But the report expressed concerns that the Roman Catholic dogmatic definitions of these concepts implies them to be \\"revealed by God\\", stating: \\"The question arises for Anglicans, however, as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held by believers as a matter of faith.\\"[80]\\r\\nOther than Anglo-Catholics, most Anglicans reject the doctrine that Mary was sinless and conceived without original sin, often citing that it is not within the Holy Scripture and is against the redemptive role and purpose of Jesus Christ merited for all human beings.\\r\\nOfficial Islamic teachings highly regard the Virgin Mary (Maryam) as a sublime model of both purity and piety. An entire Sura chapter of the Qur'an is dedicated to her nobility, holiness, and obedience to God. Among Islamic circles and discussions, she is often given a prominent status being the supreme feminine model of sanctity and maternal virtue.\\r\\nSome Western writers have claimed that the immaculate conception of Mary is a teaching of Islam. Thus, commenting in 1734 on the passage in the Qur'an, \\"I have called her Mary; and I commend her to thy protection, and also her issue, against Satan driven away with stones\\", George Sale stated: \\"It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage. For according to a tradition of Mohammed, every person that comes into the world, is touched at his birth by the devil, and therefore cries out, Mary and her son only excepted; between whom, and the evil spirit God placed a veil, so that his touch did not reach them. And for this reason they say, neither of them were guilty of any sin, like the rest of the children of Adam.\\"[81]\\r\\nOthers have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam. The Quranic account does not confirm the Immaculate Conception exclusively for Mary as in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate;[82][83] her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian doctrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam.[84][85] Moreover, Hannah's prayer in the Quran for her child to remain protected from Satan (Shay?n) was said after it had already been born, not before and expresses a natural concern any righteous parent would have. The Muslim tradition or hadith, which states that the only children born without the \\"touch of Satan\\" were Mary and Jesus,[86] should therefore not be taken in isolation from the Quran, and is to be interpreted within the specific context of exonerating Mary and her child from the charges that were made against them and not as a general statement. The specific mention of Mary and Jesus in this hadith may also be taken to represent a class of people, in keeping with the Arabic language and the Quranic verse [O Satan,] surely thou shalt have no power over My servants, except such of the erring ones as choose to follow thee (15:42).[84]\\r\\nFurther claims have been made that the Roman Catholic Church derives its doctrine from the Islamic teaching. In volume 5 of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published in 1788, Edward Gibbon wrote: \\"The Latin Church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother.\\" That he was speaking of her immaculate conception by her mother, not of her own virginal conception of Jesus, is shown by his footnote: \\"In the xiith century the immaculate conception was condemned by St. Bernard as a presumptuous novelty.\\"[87] In the aftermath of the definition of the dogma in 1854, this charge was repeated in an article published in 1865: \\"Strange as it may appear, that the doctrine which the church of Rome has promulgated, with so much pomp and ceremony, 'for the destruction of all heresies, and the confirmation of the faith of her adherents', should have its origin in the Mohametan Bible; yet the testimony of such authorities as Gibbon, and Sale, and Forster, and Gagnier, and Maracci, leave no doubt as to the marvellous fact.\\"[88]\\r\\nWithout making Islamic belief the origin of the doctrine defined in 1854, a similarity between the two has been noted also by Roman Catholic writers such as Thomas Patrick Hughes,[89] William Bernard Ullathorne,[90] Giancarlo Finazzo.[91]\\r\\nThe Roman Missal and the Roman Rite Liturgy of the Hours naturally includes references to Mary's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: \\"Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te\\" (\\"You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you.\\" It continues: \\"Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun. You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you. You are the glory of Jerusalem, you are the joy of Israel, you give honour to our people. You are all beautiful, Mary.\\")[92] On the basis of the original Gregorian chant music,[93] polyphonic settings have been composed by Anton Bruckner,[94] Pablo Casals, Maurice Durufl,[95] Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki,[96] no:Ola Gjeilo,[97] Jos Maurcio Nunes Garcia,[98] and Nikolaus Schapfl,[99]\\r\\nOther prayers honouring Mary's immaculate conception are in use outside the formal liturgy. The hymn Immaculate Mary, addressed to Mary as the Immaculately Conceived One, is closely associated with Lourdes.[100] The Immaculata prayer, composed by Saint Maximillian Kolbe, is a prayer of entrustment to Mary as the Immaculata.[101] A novena of prayers, with a specific prayer for each of the nine days has been composed under the title of the Immaculate Conception Novena.[102]\\r\\nThe 1476 extension of the feast of the Immaculate Conception to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that emblems depicting The Immaculate Conception began to appear.[103]\\r\\nMany artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist Piero di Cosimo was among those artists who tried new solutions, but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\\r\\nThe definitive iconography for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been finally established by the master and then father-in-law of Diego Velzquez, the painter and theorist Francisco Pacheco. Pacheco's iconography influenced other Spanish artists or artists active in Spain such as El Greco, Bartolom Murillo, Diego Velzquez, and Francisco Zurbarn, who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.[104][105]\\r\\nThe popularity of this particular representation of The Immaculate Conception spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the spirit of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a halo of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \\"a woman clothed with the sun\\" from Revelation 12:1ÿ2. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and putti. In some paintings the putti are holding lilies and roses, flowers often associated with Mary.[106]\\r\\ndi Cosimo, Immaculate Conception, 1505\\r\\nRubens, Immaculate Conception, 1628ÿ1629\\r\\nZurbarn, Immaculate Conception, 1630\\r\\nMurillo, Immaculate Conception, 1650\\r\\nMurillo, Immaculate Conception, 1660\\r\\nMurillo, Immaculate Conception, 1678\\r\\nCarlo Maratta, 1689\\r\\nJuan Antonio Escalante, 17th century\\r\\nSanta Maria degli Angeli, Rome\\r\\nBaroque altar in Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church, Portugal\\r\\nCaxias do Sul museum, Brazil\\r\\nStatue, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 19th century\\r\\nPalmi, Immaculate Conception, 1925\\r\\nNicaragua, Immaculate Conception, 1950\\r\\nOur Lady of Aparecida, Brasilia\\r\\nThe Immaculate Conception, Church of the Immaculate Conception in Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Spain).","input":"What is the catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception?"},{"output":"is a proposed body that would revise the constitution of the State of New York","context":"The New York state Constitutional Convention of 2018ÿ19[1] is a proposed body that would revise the constitution of the State of New York, subject to the approval of the voters.

He resents Norman's brusque manner, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Billy and Norman soon grow obsessed with catching Norman's fish rival, named \\"Walter\\", which leads to the accidental destruction of the Thayers' motorboat. Chelsea returns to find out her father has made good friends with her fiance's, now husband's, son. But when she sees the change in her father's demeanor, Chelsea attempts something Billy accomplished that she never could: a backflip. Chelsea successfully executes the dive in front of a cheering Norman, Billy, and Ethel. Chelsea and Norman finally fully embrace before she departs with Billy back home.\\r\\nThe final day on Golden Pond comes and the Thayers are loading the last of the boxes. Norman tries to move a heavy box, but starts having heart pain and collapses onto the floor of the porch. Ethel tries unsuccessfully to get the operator to phone the hospital. Norman then says the pain is gone and attempts to stand to say a final farewell to the lake. Ethel tells him she has always known about death but for the first time it felt real, thinking Norman was going to die on the spot. Ethel helps Norman to the edge of the lake where they see the loons and Norman notes how they are just like him and Ethel, that their offspring is grown and gone off on her own, and now it is just the two of them.\\r\\nJane Fonda purchased the rights to the play specifically for her father, Henry Fonda, to play the role of the cantankerous Norman Thayer.[3] The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas.\\r\\nScreenwriter Thompson spent his summers along the shores of Great Pond, located in Belgrade, Maine, but the film was made on Squam Lake in Holderness, New Hampshire.[4] The house used in the film was leased from a New York physician and was modified significantly for the shoot: an entire second floor was added as a balcony over the main living area at the request of the production designer. After the shoot, the production company was contractually obligated to return the house to its original state but the owner liked the renovations so much that he elected to keep the house that way and asked the crew not to dismantle the second story. A gazebo and a small boathouse were also relocated during the shoot.\\r\\nDespite their many common acquaintances and long careers in show business, Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn not only had never worked together, but had never met until working on the film. On the first day of shooting, Hepburn presented Henry Fonda with her longtime companion Spencer Tracy's \\"lucky\\" hat, which Fonda wore in the film. Hepburn, who was 74 at the time of filming, performed all her own stunts, including a dive into the pond. The scene in which Norman and step-grandson Billy run their boat into the rocks was filmed repeatedly. The vintage 1951 mahogany Chris-Craft boat, used strictly for the crash scene, was so sturdy that it kept bouncing off the rocks without any damage.[5][6][7] The crew had to modify the boat so it would break away in the wreck. The water level in Squam Lake was so low during the summer of production that Fonda and Doug McKeon could have stood during the scene in which they were supposedly clinging to the rocks for fear of drowning. The September water was barely knee-deep, but it was cold enough that the pair had to wear wetsuits under their clothes. Hepburn, on the other hand, dove into the water without the aid of the wetsuit because she wanted the scene to keep its authenticity. Some of the scenes in which Billy takes the boat out on his own were filmed on nearby Lake Winnipesaukee. While filming the scene where Fonda and Hepburn were watching the loons on the lake, the speedboat that zoomed by and disturbed them was so forceful it overturned their canoe in one take; Fonda was immediately taken out of the water and wrapped up in blankets as his health was fragile by that time. The speedboat was piloted by the screenwriter, Ernest Thompson.\\r\\nWhen visiting Holderness, New Hampshire, one can take a boat tour of Squam Lake and view the filming sites from the movie. There is also a restaurant called \\"Walter's Basin\\", which is named after the trout called \\"Walter\\" that Billy catches with Norman. For filming, \\"Walter\\" was brought in from a trout pond at the nearby Castle in the Clouds estate. He was released after his capture back into Squam Lake. Leftover footage of Fonda and Hepburn driving through the New Hampshire countryside, as seen in the opening credits, was later used for the opening of the CBS television sitcom Newhart.\\r\\nThe studio behind the film was ITC Entertainment, the British company presided over (until late 1981) by Lord Grade, the television and film mogul. It was Grade who largely raised the financing for the film.\\r\\nWith a box office take of $119,285,432, On Golden Pond was the second-highest grossing film of the year, following Raiders of the Lost Ark, which earned $209,562,121.[8]\\r\\nOn Golden Pond garnered widespread critical acclaim with critics highlighting the performances of Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 92% based on 386 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"There's little that happens in On Golden Pond that isn't thoroughly predictable from the start, but the film is blessed with so much star power, charm and honest sentiment that everyone in the audience is willing to ignore the cliches and go the distance.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said \\"On Golden Pond was a treasure for many reasons, but the best one, I think, is that I could believe it. I could believe in its major characters and their relationships, and in the things they felt for one another, and there were moments when the movie was witness to human growth and change. I left the theater feeling good and warm, and with a certain resolve to try to mend my own relationships and learn to start listening better . . . watching the movie, I felt I was witnessing something rare and valuable.\\"[9]\\r\\nIn his The New York Times review, Vincent Canby said, \\"As a successful Broadway play, On Golden Pond was processed American cheese, smooth, infinitely spreadable and bland, with color added by the actors . . . the movie . . . still American cheese, but its stars ÿ Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman ÿ add more than color to this pasteurized product. On Golden Pond now has the bite of a good old cheddar . . . Mr. Fonda gives one of the great performances of his long, truly distinguished career. Here is film acting of the highest order . . . Miss Hepburn . . . is also in fine form. One of the most appealing things about her as an actress is the way she responds to ÿ and is invigorated by ÿ a strong co-star . . . she needs someone to support, challenge and interact with. Mr. Fonda is the best thing that's happened to her since Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart . . . an added pleasure is the opportunity to see Dabney Coleman [in] a role that goes beyond the caricatures he's usually given to play . . . On Golden Pond is a mixed blessing, but it offers one performance of rare quality and three others that are very good. That's not half-bad.\\"[10]\\r\\nTV Guide rates it 3?? out of a possible four stars, calling it \\"a beautifully photographed movie filled with poignancy, humor, and (of course) superb acting . . . there could have been no finer final curtain for [Henry Fonda] than this.\\"[11] Channel 4 sums up its review by stating, \\"Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn both shine in an impressively executed Hollywood drama. [It] has its mawkish moments but there's a certain pleasure in that, and writer Thompson's analysis of old age is sensitive, thought-provoking and credible.\\"[12]\\r\\nNot all reviewers were impressed, however. David Kehr of the Chicago Reader called the film \\"the cinematic equivalent of shrink-wrapping, in which all of the ideas, feelings, characters, and images are neatly separated and hermetically sealed to prevent spoilage, abrasion, or any contact with the natural world . . . Mark Rydell's bright, banal visual style further sterilizes the issues. The film exudes complacency and self-congratulation; it is a very cowardly, craven piece of ersatz art.\\"[13] Time Out London says, \\"Two of Hollywood's best-loved veterans deserved a far better swan song than this sticky confection.\\"[14] Mad magazine satirized the film as On Olden Pond.\\r\\nAmerican Film Institute recognition","input":"How many oscars did on golden pond win?"},{"output":"prevents Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances.","context":"","input":"What five rights does the first amendment guarantee?"},{"output":"December 10","context":"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Swedish: Nobelpriset i kemi) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands, \\"for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions.\\" From 1901 to 2018, the award has been bestowed on a total of 180 individuals.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlfred Nobel stipulated in his last will and testament that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \\"greatest benefit on mankind\\" in physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literature.[3][4] Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[5][6] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31?million Swedish kronor (US$198 million, Euro?176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.[7] Due to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until April 26, 1897 that it was approved by the Storting (Norwegian Parliament).[8][9] The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on June 7, the Swedish Academy on June 9, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June 11.[10][11] The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[9][12][13] According to Nobel's will, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences were to award the Prize in Chemistry.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates in October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.  \\"The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm is when each Nobel Laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of His Majesty the King of Sweden. The Nobel Laureate receives three things: a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount\\" (\\"What the Nobel Laureates Receive\\").  Later the Nobel Banquet is held in Stockholm City Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nA maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected. The award can be given to a maximum of three recipients per year. It consists of a gold medal, a diploma, and a cash grant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nobel Laureates in chemistry are selected by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In its first stage, several thousand people are asked to nominate candidates. These names are scrutinized and discussed by experts until only the laureates remain. This slow and thorough process, is arguably what gives the prize its importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nForms, which amount to a personal and exclusive invitation, are sent to about three thousand selected individuals to invite them to submit nominations. The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the Prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. In practice, some nominees do become known. It is also common for publicists to make such a claim ÿ founded or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nominations are screened by committee, and a list is produced of approximately two hundred preliminary candidates. This list is forwarded to selected experts in the field. They remove all but approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations to the appropriate institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can occur if the individual died in the months between the nomination and the decision of the prize committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe award in chemistry requires  the significance of achievements being recognized is \\"tested by time.\\" In practice it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. As a downside of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a Prize, as the discoverers may have died by the time the impact of their work is realized. For example, the contributions of Rosalind Franklin in discovering the structure of DNA:  her x-ray crystallography citing the shape of DNA as a helix, were not realized until after her death, and the recipients of the prize were Watson, Crick, and Wilkins.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Chemistry Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket[15] in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal feature an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse (front side of the medal). The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833ÿ1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design.[16][17] The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nNobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it. The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sum. The amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the Nobel Foundation.  For example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million),[20] but in 2012, the amount was 8 million Swedish Krona, or US$1.1 million.[21]  If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients, but if there are three, the awarding committee may opt to divide the grant equally, or award half to one recipient and a quarter to each of the two others.[22][23][24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has drawn criticism from chemists who feel that the prize is more frequently awarded to non-chemists than to chemists.[26] In the 30 years leading up to 2012, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded ten times for work classified as biochemistry or molecular biology, and once to a materials scientist. In the ten years leading up to 2012, only four prizes were for work that is strictly in chemistry.[26] Commenting on the scope of the award, The Economist explained that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is bound by Nobel's bequest, which specifies awards only in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine, and peace. Biology was in its infancy in Nobel's day, suggesting why no award was established. The Economist argued there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics either, another major discipline, and added that Nobel's stipulation of no more than three winners is not readily applicable to modern physics, where progress is typically made through huge collaborations rather than by individual scientists.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Nobel's death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutionsthree Swedish and one Norwegianshould award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics, chemistry, and economics, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions.","input":"When is the nobel prize for chemistry awarded?"},{"output":"women's ice hockey","context":"The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially the XVIII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XVIIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver [2]) (Ce϶ꝓ?H, Dai Jhachi-kai Orinpikku Tkikygi Taikai), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated from 7 to 22 February 1998 in Nagano, Japan.\\r\\n72 nations and 2,176 participants contested in 7 sports and 68 events at 15 venues.

Winston in the early 1950s while working for Jerrold Electronics on their development of cable television.[1]\\r\\nIn the 1970s it became commonplace on VHF television antenna connections in the United States, as coaxial cables replaced twin-lead, and later for UHF also.\\r\\nThe F connector is inexpensive, yet has good 75? impedance match for frequencies well over 1?GHz[2] and has usable bandwidth up to several GHz. One reason for its low cost is that it commonly uses the solid conductor (center wire) of the specified types of coaxial cable as the pin of the male connector.\\r\\nThis design is subject to the surface properties of the inner conductor (which must be solid wire) and is not corrosion resistant; hence waterproof versions are needed for outside use (for example, on aerials).\\r\\nCorrosion resistance can be improved by coating all bare copper wires with silicone grease. The male connector body is typically crimped, or sometimes screwed, onto the exposed outer braid. Female F Type connectors have an external 3/8-32 UNEF thread (9.5?mm diameter). Most male connectors have a matching internally threaded connecting ring, though push-on versions are also available.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cable and satellite television entities (as a near standard practice) use compression fittings with F Type Connectors on customer premises.\\r\\nF Type Coax connectors are probably the most suitable for domestic terrestrial, cable, and satellite TV installations where the delivery of very high frequency information is required. Belling-Lee connectors (IEC 169-2) [used on European terrestrial receivers] are not well suited for long haul building delivery of frequencies above 500 MHz, because the standard was designed around tube receivers and Mediumwave (or Shortwave) antennas (but workarounds exist) [2]. Type F Connectors require slightly more care to properly install the Male connectors to the cable than the Belling-Lee type, with the exception of compression or flex type connections.\\r\\nSome component suppliers have in their catalog weatherproof (watertight) \\"F connectors\\". Tightness is achieved by inserting an O-ring of about 7 mm between the plug and the socket before tightening, making the union watertight.\\r\\nPush-on (aka Flex) F Type connectors provide poorer shielding against microwave signals of high field strength. This leakage problem is more an artifact of bent or partly broken push on connectors, but is mostly not observed with compression connectors.

It is the busiest airport in the Caribbean region by passenger traffic. Over 4 million passengers board a plane at the airport per year according to the Federal Aviation Administration.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airport is owned by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and managed by Aerostar Airport Holdings, a publicÿprivate partnership which was awarded a lease by the government of Puerto Rico to operate and manage the airport for 40 years beginning in 2013.[6] SJU is the second international airport to be privatized in the United States and its territories, and, as of 2013, is the only currently privatized airport in the nation.[7] Taxis and rental cars can transport travelers to and from the airport. The airport serves as a gateway to the Caribbean islands. SJU covers 1,600 acres (647 ha) of land.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945, aware of the importance of aviation for the development of the economy of Puerto Rico, the island government had pointed out the need to build a newer international airport capable of handling the growing air traffic of San Juan International Airport, in Isla Grande, that had been operating since 1929; as well as responding to the needs of the future. Until then Isla Grande had been the main airport of Puerto Rico. As airlines began switching from propeller aircraft to jets, the 4,000-foot Isla Grande airstrip did not have the necessary distance for modern aircraft to land and take off. (The Isla Grande Airport, now named in honor of Maj. Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci, Pilot of the US Air Force F-111, who was killed-in-action in Libya in 1986, currently has a runway of 5,542 feet in length.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, the government had also decided that it should direct the air operations, relying these powers in the Puerto Rico Transportation Authority, created in 1942, which later became the Ports Authority. The Committee of Airports of the Planning Board began to study the feasibility of the new airport, submitting in 1944 its plans and studies to the Federal Civil Aeronautics Administration, to determine the most appropriate place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945, it was determined that the place would be Isla Verde (Carolina), to make the airport a metropolitan facility. Construction was approved by the Puerto Rico Planning Board in 1946, and the project began in 1947. During that same year, the Port Authority of Puerto Rico assumed title to and ownership of the Isla Grande Airport and other regional airports, which had been military installations during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the new airport was carried out by the firm of Toro-Ferrer, founded by the architects Miguel Ferrer (1914ÿ2004), and architect Osvaldo Toro (1914ÿ1995), which were also known for their designs of the Caribe Hilton Hotel and the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1949, the first phase of construction of the Isla Verde Airport was completed: cleaning, filling, leveling and drainage of soils. The second phase also began: paving the runway, taxiways, and platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe certified airlines operating in Puerto Rico in 1950 were Pan American World Airways, Eastern Air Lines, Riddle Aviation Co., Caribbean Atlantic Airlines, British Airways, Iberia, Dominican Airlines and Flying Tigers Airline. The latter contracted the movement of migrant workers to the United States, with the Insular Department of Labor, transferring some 5,706 workers to different points of that nation, at a cost of $55 per passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 22, 1955, the Puerto Rico International Airport was inaugurated, built on a 1,718.72 acre land lot. The facilities, estimated at a cost of $22 million, had a six-story passenger terminal, control tower, 7,800-foot long runway (8ÿ26), cargo building, fire and police stations, and a hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nHundreds of people, enthusiastic about the new aerial installation, witnessed the inaugural events presided over by Luis Mu?oz Marn. In a part of his eloquent speech, the Governor said: \\"Impressive is this work in its structure and in its many facilities, but not as impressive as the fact that this center of communications symbolizes the great technical processes that are transforming civilization\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first year of operations of the new airport produced an upward movement of passengers to 694,199 and a total of 28 million pounds of cargo was handled.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1959, major airlines had introduced jets, which significantly reduced flight time and increased flight cruising safety. At the start of operations, the airport had only one runway (8/26), the old control tower on top of the Hotel, 3 terminals and a parking lot for 200 cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the beginning of the 60s, several expansion and improvement projects began, starting with the runway extending from 7,800 to 10,000 feet in length. Construction of the second runway (10ÿ28) on the south side began in May 1967. The project was completed in 1974 at an approximate cost of $4.2 million. With the introduction of the 747 aircraft, runway 8ÿ26 was reinforced and widened in 1974, and ten years later it was repaved.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 17, 1983, the two-leveled vehicular access system was built at a cost of approximately $9.2 million. This access separates the arrivals and departures of passengers at different levels, to eliminate traffic congestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 18, 1985, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernndez Col܇n, converted to law the project to Senate Number 1, officially designating the international airport under the name of Luis Mu?oz Marn, in honor of the first governor of Puerto Rico elected by the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airport served as a hub for Pan Am, Trans Caribbean Airways, Eastern Air Lines, and for a short period a focus city for TWA. It was also the center for Puerto Rico's international airline, Prinair, from 1966 to 1984, when Prinair went bankrupt.

Doug Liman directed The Bourne Identity (2002) and Paul Greengrass directed The Bourne Supremacy (2004), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and Jason Bourne (2016). Tony Gilroy co-wrote each film except for Jason Bourne and directed The Bourne Legacy (2012).\\r\\n\\r\\nDamon chose not to return for the fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, which introduces a new main character, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), a Department of Defense operative who runs for his life because of Bourne's actions in Ultimatum. The character of Jason Bourne does not appear in Legacy, but mention of his name and pictures of Damon as Bourne are shown throughout the film.[2] Damon returned for the fifth installment, Jason Bourne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bourne series has received generally positive critical reception and grossed over $1.6 billion. It is noted for its use of real stunt work, in contrast to the growing use of computer-generated imagery in action scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea with two gunshot wounds in his back and a device with the number of a Swiss safe deposit box embedded in his hip. Upon reaching shore, the man assumes the name Jason Bourne after finding a passport under that name in the safe deposit box, along with other alien passports, large amounts of assorted currencies, and a gun. He subsequently attempts to discover his true identity while countering attempts on his life by CIA assassins, eventually realizing that he is one such assassin who failed to complete his most recent mission. Bourne breaks his connections to the CIA and unites with Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), a woman who helped him learn about his most recent actions prior to his memory loss. Bourne's conflict with the CIA reaches a climax when he takes the fight to their doorstep.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome two years after learning that he is a trained assassin and breaking his connections with the CIA, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a crime to cover up the true perpetrator. An attempt on his life by Kirill (Karl Urban) a Russian cop, results in Marie's (Franka Potente) death in India. Bourne, thinking that the CIA is hunting him again, proceeds to hunt those responsible for her death and his forgotten past. Bourne discovers that Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), one of the men who oversaw the program which trained Bourne to be an assassin (Operation Treadstone), had stolen millions of dollars from the CIA. Abbott had planned to frame Bourne for the theft, followed by assassinating Bourne in India. Bourne exposes Abbott to Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), the CIA officer in charge of finding Bourne. Abbott kills himself. Bourne goes to Moscow where he is identified, resulting in a long car chase through Moscow.  At the end of the chase, Kirill dies. Bourne is in Moscow to find the daughter of a Russian couple killed in his first mission. He tells her that it was not a suicide, as she had been long told, but a murder. Bourne then goes back into hiding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter six weeks of disconnection from his job, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) learns that a British journalist has been investigating his past and contacts him to find out who his source is. Bourne is subsequently targeted by Operation Blackbriar, an upgraded Operation Treadstone, which also has taken note of the investigation. Believing that Bourne is a threat and is seeking revenge, Blackbriar's director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) begins a new hunt for Bourne. Bourne manages to take classified documents proving that Blackbriar has targeted U.S. citizens; he is aided by Pamela Landy, who disagreed with Vosen from the beginning and does not support Blackbriar's existence, and former Treadstone logistics technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). She may have had romantic feelings for Bourne before his final mission and resultant amnesia. Bourne finally comes face to face with the person who oversaw his behavior modification as the first Treadstone operative some years earlier, memories of which resurface. Those responsible for Treadstone and Blackbriar are exposed, and Bourne goes underground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is a member of Operation Outcome, a United States Department of Defense black ops program which enhances the physical and mental abilities of field operatives through pills referred to as \\"chems\\". Cross, deployed to Alaska for a training assignment, traverses rugged terrain to reach a cabin operated by an exiled Outcome operative. Meanwhile, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has exposed the Blackbriar and Treadstone programs in public, leading the FBI and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate those involved. Retired Air Force Colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton), who is responsible for overseeing the Beta program from which the CIA's Treadstone and Blackbriar were developed, decides to end Outcome and kill its agents. Cross manages to survive several attempts on his life and seeks a way to get more chems, as his have run out. Cross eventually comes upon Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), his last link to gain more chems. He discovers she has no pills but that his physical enhancements can be \\"viraled-out\\" and can become genetically permanent, so he would no longer need physical chems. He, in turn, reveals to her that without the help of the mental chem enhancements, he possesses a well-below average IQ. To avoid this mental regression, and the operatives hunting them, the two travel to a factory in Manila and with Shearing's help, Cross initiates and survives the potentially fatal process of viraling-out of his dependency on the remaining mental-enhancing pills. They evade the Manila police and an operative from the new LARX program, and successfully escape from the Philippines on a junk ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), whom Bourne sent into hiding in The Bourne Ultimatum, gains access to sensitive CIA files. She contacts Bourne to share information about his past, including how he was recruited for Operation Treadstone and his father's role in that operation. Bourne learns that his father, Richard Webb (Gregg Henry), designed Operation Treadstone and was assassinated by the CIA because he did not want his son to enter the program and become a killer. CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) hunts down Parsons and Bourne using a foreign asset (Vincent Cassel) and the technical skills of CIA Cyber Ops Division head Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander), while Bourne plans to avenge his father's death. Bourne first tries to make the man who recruited him into the CIA confirm his understanding of his father's death. He then plans to avenge himself against Dewey. Meanwhile Lee wants to bring Bourne back into the CIA's special operations and Dewey allows her to believe she has his support even though he plans to eliminate Bourne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a subplot involving Operation Iron Hand, a surveillance program that will have secret access to a giant social media service called Deep Dream. In the past the CIA and Deep Dream have had a contract to work together, but Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed), its founder and CEO, wants to end this cooperation. When Dewey refuses to allow any such change, Kalloor plans to reveal his relationship with the CIA and its plans to violate the privacy expectations of Deep Dream's millions of users. Dewey plans to assassinate Kalloor before his planned revelations.\\r\\n\\r\\nProducer Frank Marshall said Universal Pictures is hoping to plan a sequel to Jason Bourne, making it the sixth Bourne film. He also stated that a sequel to The Bourne Legacy featuring Renner's Cross is unlikely although he did not explicitly rule it out.[3] However, in March 2017, Matt Damon cast doubt upon a sequel, hinting that people \\"might be done\\" with the character.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 13, 2018, USA Network ordered a pilot for a series titled Treadstone which will be written by Tim Kring. The series will explore the origins of the Treadstone program as well as sleeper agents associated with it.[5] On August 16, 2018 it was announced Treadstone will bypass the pilot stage in favor of a straight-to-series commitment.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bourne series has received both critical and commercial success. Ultimatum won three Academy Awards: Best Film Editing, Sound and Best Sound Editing.[7] Both Supremacy and Ultimatum won the Empire Award for Best Film.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector Doug Liman stated that he had been a fan of The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum since he read it in high school. Near the end of production of Liman's previous film Swingers, Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from Warner Brothers and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production.[28] Liman approached a wide range of actors for the role of Bourne, including Russell Crowe and Sylvester Stallone, before he eventually cast Matt Damon. Liman found that Damon understood and appreciated that, though The Bourne Identity would have its share of action, the focus was primarily on character and plot.[29] Production was difficult, with screenplay rewrites occurring throughout the entire filming and Liman constantly arguing with Universal's executives.[30] The Bourne Identity was released in June 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversal confirmed at a media conference in Los Angeles, California, that they have plans to release more Bourne films, despite Legacy being given mixed reviews by critics.[31] In a December 2012 interview, Matt Damon revealed that he and Paul Greengrass are interested in returning for the next film.[32] On November 8, 2013, Deadline reported that the fifth installment in the franchise will feature Renner's Cross, with Justin Lin directing.[33] Andrew Baldwin was attached for the film's screenplay writing. On September 15, 2014, it was announced that Damon and Greengrass will indeed return for the next Bourne film, taking the release date, with Renner returning as Cross in a separate film, at a later date.[34] In November 2014, Damon confirmed that he and Greengrass will return [35] with a script from themselves and film editor Christopher Rouse.[36] On May 23, 2015, Deadline reported that Alicia Vikander is in talks to star with Damon in the fifth film.[37] In June 2015, Variety reported that Stiles will reprise her role as Nicky Parsons and Viggo Mortensen is in talks to appear in the film as an assassin who's tracking down Bourne. Deadline reported that Vikander is confirmed to appear in the film.[38][39] On July 28, 2015, Tommy Lee Jones was cast in a role in the fifth film.[40] On September 1, 2015, Variety reported that French actor Vincent Cassel is cast as the film's villain.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nProducer Frank Marshall confirmed principal photography for the new film had commenced on September 8, 2015.[42] The film itself was released in the UK on July 27, 2016[43] and in the U.S. on July 29, 2016.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe films have been noted for their \\"well placed\\", \\"understated\\" and \\"tastefully done\\" product placement of a \\"diverse\\" range of brands, which in the case of the third film, earned the producers tens of millions of dollars.[45][46] The Bourne Identity features brands such as The Guardian newspaper, BT Tower in London and Tag Heuer watches.[45] The Bourne Supremacy features mobile phones made by Sony Ericsson.[47] The Bourne Ultimatum features a total of 54 brands including The Guardian and BT for the second time;[48][49] mobile phones made by Motorola, Nokia and Carphone Warehouse, most prominently the RAZR 2 and SLVR, as Motorola was a major sponsor and had a movie tie-in customized phone;[47][49] cars made by BMW, Ford, Mercedes, and Volkswagen, most prominently the Volkswagen Touareg 2, as Volkswagen provided $25?million in funding;[48][49][50] and technology products such as CTX computer monitors, Norton AntiVirus and the Google web search engine.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scores of the first three films of the series were written by English composer John Powell, with James Newton Howard scoring the fourth film, The Bourne Legacy. \\r\\nPowell returned, with David Buckley to compose the score of the fifth film. \\r\\nPowell was not the original choice as composer for The Bourne Identitya score for the film had already been composed by Carter Burwell and recorded by an orchestra, when director Doug Liman contacted Powell to provide an alternative soundtrack as he was dissatisfied with the music.

The region is a habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals and seabirds. The oil, originally extracted at the Prudhoe Bay oil field, eventually covered 1,300 miles (2,100?km) of coastline,[3] and 11,000 square miles (28,000?km2) of ocean.[6][7]\\r\\nAccording to official reports, the ship was carrying 53.09451?million US gallons (1,264,155?bbl; 200,984.6?m3) of oil, of which about 10.8?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 41,000?m3) were spilled into the Prince William Sound.[1][8] An approximate figure of 11?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 42,000?m3) was a commonly accepted estimate of the spill's volume and has been used by the State of Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council,[3] the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.[5][9][10]\\r\\nMultiple factors have been identified as contributing to the incident:\\r\\nCaptain Joseph Hazelwood, who was widely reported to have been drinking heavily that night, was not at the controls when the ship struck the reef. However, as the senior officer, he was in command of the ship even though he was asleep in his bunk. In light of the other findings, investigative reporter Greg Palast stated in 2008, \\"Forget the drunken skipper fable. As to Captain Joe Hazelwood, he was below decks, sleeping off his bender. At the helm, the third mate never would have collided with Bligh Reef had he looked at his RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on. In fact, the tanker's radar was left broken and disabled for more than a year before the disaster, and Exxon management knew it. It was just too expensive to fix and operate.\\"[14] Exxon blamed Captain Hazelwood for the grounding of the tanker.[13]\\r\\nOther factors, according to an MIT course entitled \\"Software System Safety\\" by Professor Nancy G. Leveson,[15] included:\\r\\nThis disaster resulted in International Maritime Organization introducing comprehensive marine pollution prevention rules (MARPOL) through various conventions. The rules were ratified by member countries and, under International Ship Management rules, the ships are being operated with a common objective of \\"safer ships and cleaner oceans\\".[19]\\r\\nIn 2009, Exxon Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood offered a \\"heartfelt apology\\" to the people of Alaska, suggesting he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: \\"The true story is out there for anybody who wants to look at the facts, but that's not the sexy story and that's not the easy story,\\" he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical dispersant, a surfactant and solvent mixture, was applied to the slick by a private company on March 24 with a helicopter. But the helicopter missed the target area. Scientific data on its toxicity were either thin or incomplete. In addition, public acceptance of a new, widespread chemical treatment was lacking. Landowners, fishing groups, and conservation organizations questioned the use of chemicals on hundreds of miles of shoreline when other alternatives may have been available.\\"[21][22][22][23]\\r\\nAccording to a report by David Kirby for TakePart, the main component of the Corexit formulation used during cleanup, 2-butoxyethanol, was identified as \\"one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.[24]\\r\\nMechanical cleanup was started shortly afterwards using booms and skimmers, but the skimmers were not readily available during the first 24 hours following the spill, and thick oil and kelp tended to clog the equipment. Despite civilian insistence for a complete clean, only 10% of total oil was actually completely cleaned.[1] Exxon was widely criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster and John Devens, the mayor of Valdez, has said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate response to the crisis.[25] More than 11,000 Alaska residents, along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to restore the environment.\\r\\nBecause Prince William Sound contained many rocky coves where the oil collected, the decision was made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. plankton) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the biodegradation of oil. At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of natural and facilitated remediation processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the Exxon Valdez spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered and a study conducted by NOAA determined that as of early 2007 more than 26?thousand U.S. gallons (98?m3) of oil remain in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, declining at a rate of less than 4% per year.[26][27]\\r\\nBoth the long-term and short-term effects of the oil spill have been studied.[28] Immediate effects included the deaths of 100,000 to as many as 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 sea otters, approximately 12 river otters, 300 harbor seals, 247 bald eagles, and 22 orcas, and an unknown number of salmon and herring.[8][29]\\r\\nIn 2003, fourteen years after the spill, a team from the University of North Carolina found that the remaining oil was lasting far longer than anticipated, which in turn had resulted in more long-term loss of many species than had been expected. The researchers found that at only a few parts per billion, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons caused a long-term increase in mortality rates. They reported that \\"species as diverse as sea otters, harlequin ducks and killer whales suffered large, long-term losses and that oiled mussel beds and other tidal shoreline habitats will take an estimated 30 years to recover.\\"[30]\\r\\nIn 2006, a study done by the National Marine Fisheries Service in Juneau found that about 6 miles (9.7?km) of shoreline around Prince William Sound was still affected by the spill, with 101.6 tonnes of oil remaining in the area. Exxon Mobil denied any concerns over any remaining oil, stating that they anticipated a remaining fraction that they assert will not cause any long-term ecological impacts, according to the conclusions of the studies they had done: \\"We've done 350 peer-reviewed studies of Prince William Sound, and those studies conclude that Prince William Sound has recovered, it's healthy and it's thriving.\\"[31] However, in 2007 a NOAA study concluded that this contamination can produce chronic low-level exposure, discourage subsistence where the contamination is heavy, and decrease the \\"wilderness character\\" of the area.[27]\\r\\nThe effects of the spill continued to be felt for many years afterwards. As of 2010 there were an estimated 23,000 US gallons (87?m3) of Valdez crude oil still in Alaska's sand and soil, breaking down at a rate estimated at less than 4% per year.[32]\\r\\nOn March 24, 2014, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the spill, NOAA scientists reported that some species seem to have recovered, with the sea otter the latest creature to return to pre-spill numbers. Scientists who have monitored the spill area for the last 25 years report that concern remains for one of two pods of local orca whales, with fears that one pod may eventually die out.[33] Federal scientists estimate that between 16,000 and 21,000 US gallons (61 to 79 m3) of oil remains on beaches in Prince William Sound and up to 450 miles (725?km) away. Some of the oil does not appear to have biodegraded at all. A USGS scientist who analyses the remaining oil along the coastline states that it remains among rocks and between tide marks. \\"The oil mixes with seawater and forms an emulsion...Left out, the surface crusts over but the inside still has the consistency of mayonnaise ÿ or mousse.\\"[34] Alaska state senator Berta Gardner is urging Alaskan politicians to demand that the US government force ExxonMobil to pay the final $92 million (S57 million) still owed from the court settlement. The major part of the money would be spent to finish cleaning up oiled beaches and attempting to restore the crippled herring population.[34]\\r\\nIn the case of Exxon v. Baker, an Anchorage jury awarded $287?million for actual damages and $5?billion for punitive damages. To protect itself in case the judgment was affirmed, Exxon obtained a $4.8?billion credit line from J.P. Morgan & Co. J.P. Morgan created the first modern credit default swap in 1994, so that Morgan's would not have to hold as much money in reserve (8% of the loan under Basel I) against the risk of Exxon's default.[35]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Exxon appealed the ruling, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the original judge, Russel Holland, to reduce the punitive damages. On December 6, 2002, the judge announced that he had reduced the damages to $4?billion, which he concluded was justified by the facts of the case and was not grossly excessive. Exxon appealed again and the case returned to court to be considered in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling in a similar case, which caused Judge Holland to increase the punitive damages to $4.5?billion, plus interest.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter more appeals, and oral arguments heard by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on January 27, 2006, the damages award was cut to $2.5?billion on December 22, 2006. The court cited recent Supreme Court rulings relative to limits on punitive damages.[36]\\r\\nExxon appealed again. On May 23, 2007, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied ExxonMobil's request for a third hearing and let stand its ruling that Exxon owes $2.5?billion in punitive damages. Exxon then appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.[37] On February 27, 2008, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for 90 minutes. Justice Samuel Alito, who at the time, owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Exxon stock, recused himself from the case.[38] In a decision issued June 25, 2008, Justice David Souter issued the judgment of the court, vacating the $2.5?billion award and remanding the case back to the lower court, finding that the damages were excessive with respect to maritime common law. Exxon's actions were deemed \\"worse than negligent but less than malicious.\\"[39] The punitive damages were further reduced to an amount of $507.5?million.[40] The Court's ruling was that maritime punitive damages should not exceed the compensatory damages,[40] supported by a peculiar precedent dating back from 1818.[41] Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy has decried the ruling as \\"another in a line of cases where this Supreme Court has misconstrued congressional intent to benefit large corporations.\\"[42]\\r\\nExxon's official position was that punitive damages greater than $25?million were not justified because the spill resulted from an accident, and because Exxon spent an estimated $2?billion cleaning up the spill and a further $1?billion to settle related civil and criminal charges. Attorneys for the plaintiffs contended that Exxon bore responsibility for the accident because the company \\"put a drunk in charge of a tanker in Prince William Sound.\\"[43]\\r\\nExxon recovered a significant portion of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez.[44][45] Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75?million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5?billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750?million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement,[46] and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.[47]\\r\\nAs of December 15, 2009, Exxon paid all owed $507.5 million punitive damages, including lawsuit costs, plus interest, which were further distributed to thousands of plaintiffs.[48]\\r\\nIn October 1989, Exxon filed suit against the State of Alaska, charging that the government had interfered with Exxon's attempts to clean up the spill by refusing to approve the use of dispersant chemicals until the night of the 26th. The government disputed the claim, stating that there was a long-standing agreement to allow the use of dispersants to clean up spills, thus Exxon did not require permission to use them, and that in fact Exxon had not had enough dispersant on hand to effectively handle a spill of the size created by the Valdez.[49] Exxon filed claims in October 1990 against the Coast Guard, asking to be reimbursed for cleanup costs and damages awarded to plaintiffs in any lawsuits filed by the State of Alaska or the Federal Government against Exxon. The company claimed that the Coast Guard was \\"wholly or partially responsible\\" for the spill, because they had granted mariners' licenses to the crew of the Valdez, and because they had given the Valdez permission to leave regular shipping lanes to avoid ice. They also reiterated the claim that the Coast Guard had delayed cleanup by refusing to give permission to use chemical dispersants on the spill immediately.[50]\\r\\nThe Oil Spill Recovery Institute was formed after United States Congress approved it to seek a solution. Collaborating with InnoCentive they found a partial solution for the flow of oil.[51]\\r\\nA report by the US National Response Team summarized the event and made a number of recommendations, such as changes to the work patterns of Exxon crew in order to address the causes of the accident.[1]\\r\\nIn response to the spill, the United States Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA). The legislation included a clause that prohibits any vessel that, after March 22, 1989, has caused an oil spill of more than 1?million US gallons (3,800?m3) in any marine area, from operating in Prince William Sound.[52]\\r\\nIn April 1998, the company argued in a legal action against the Federal government that the ship should be allowed back into Alaskan waters. Exxon claimed OPA was effectively a bill of attainder, a regulation that was unfairly directed at Exxon alone.[53] In 2002, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Exxon. As of 2002, OPA had prevented 18 ships from entering Prince William Sound.[54]\\r\\nOPA also set a schedule for the gradual phase in of a double hull design, providing an additional layer between the oil tanks and the ocean. While a double hull would likely not have prevented the Valdez disaster, a Coast Guard study estimated that it would have cut the amount of oil spilled by 60 percent.[55]\\r\\nThe Exxon Valdez supertanker was towed to San Diego, arriving on July 10. Repairs began on July 30. Approximately 1,600 short tons (1,500?t) of steel were removed and replaced. In June 1990 the tanker, renamed S/R Mediterranean, left harbor after $30?million of repairs.[54] It was still sailing as of January 2010, registered in Panama. The vessel was then owned by a Hong Kong company, who operated it under the name Oriental Nicety. In August 2012, it was beached at Alang, India and dismantled.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the spill, Alaska governor Steve Cowper issued an executive order requiring two tugboats to escort every loaded tanker from Valdez out through Prince William Sound to Hinchinbrook Entrance. As the plan evolved in the 1990s, one of the two routine tugboats was replaced with a 210-foot (64?m) Escort Response Vehicle (ERV). Tankers at Valdez are no longer single-hulled. Congress enacted legislation requiring all tankers to be double-hulled as of 2015.[56]\\r\\nIn 1991, following the collapse of the local marine population (particularly clams, herring and seals) the Chugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native Corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It has since recovered.[57]\\r\\nAccording to several studies funded by the state of Alaska, the spill had both short-term and long-term economic effects. These included the loss of recreational sports, fisheries, reduced tourism, and an estimate of what economists call \\"existence value\\", which is the value to the public of a pristine Prince William Sound.[58][59][60][61]\\r\\nThe economy of the city of Cordova, Alaska was adversely affected after the spill damaged stocks of salmon and herring in the area.[62][63] The village of Chenega was transformed into an emergency base and media outlet.The local villagers had to cope with a tripling of their population from 80 to 250. When asked how they felt about the situation, a village councillor noted that they were too shocked and busy to be depressed; others emphasized the human costs of leaving children unattended while their parents worked to clean up.[64] Many Native Americans were worried that too much time was spent on the fishery and not enough on the land that supports subsidence hunting.\\r\\nIn 2010, a CNN report alleged that many oil spill cleanup workers involved in the Exxon Valdez response had subsequently become sick. Anchorage lawyer Dennis Mestas found that this was true of 6,722 of 11,000 worker files he was able to inspect. Access to the records was controlled by Exxon. Exxon responded in a statement to CNN:\\r\\nAfter 20 years, there is no evidence suggesting that either cleanup workers or the residents of the communities affected by the Valdez spill have had any adverse health effects as a result of the spill or its cleanup.[65][66]\\r\\nIn 1992, Exxon released a video titled Scientists and the Alaska Oil Spill, to be distributed to schools. Dr. Michael Fry called it a piece of \\"corporate propaganda\\".[67]\\r\\nIn December 1994, the Unabomber assassinated Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas Mosser, accusing him of having \\"helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident\\". The PR company claimed not to have been contracted during the actual crisis.[68]\\r\\nSeveral weeks after the spill, Saturday Night Live aired a pointed sketch featuring Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman, and Victoria Jackson as cleanup workers struggling to scrub the oil off of animals and rocks on a beach in Prince William Sound.\\r\\nIn the 1995 film Waterworld, the Exxon Valdez is the flagship of the movie's villain, \\"The Deacon,\\" the leader of a band of scavenging raiders.

Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that established the principle of judicial review in the United States, meaning that American courts have the power to strike down laws, statutes, and some government actions that contravene the U.S. Constitution. Decided in 1803, Marbury remains the single most important decision in American constitutional law.[1] The Court's landmark decision established that the U.S. Constitution is actual \\"law\\", not just a statement of political principles and ideals, and helped define the boundary between the constitutionally separate executive and judicial branches of the American form of government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case ultimately originated from the political and ideological rivalry between outgoing U.S. President John Adams and incoming President Thomas Jefferson.[2] Adams had lost the U.S. presidential election of 1800 to Jefferson, and in March 1801, just two days before his term as president ended, Adams appointed several dozen men who supported him and the Federalist Party to new circuit judge and justice of the peace positions in an attempt to frustrate Jefferson and his supporters in the Democratic-Republican Party.[3] The U.S. Senate quickly confirmed Adams's appointments, but upon Jefferson's inauguration two days later, a few of the new judges' commissions still had not been delivered.[3] Jefferson believed the commissions were void because they had not been delivered in time, and instructed his new Secretary of State, James Madison, not to deliver them.[4] One of the men whose commissions had not been delivered in time was William Marbury, a Maryland businessman who had been a strong supporter of Adams and the Federalists. In late 1801, after Madison had repeatedly refused to deliver his commission, Marbury filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court asking the Court to issue a writ of mandamus forcing Madison to deliver his commission.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an opinion written by Chief Justice John Marshall, the Court held firstly that Madison's refusal to deliver Marbury's commission was illegal, and secondly that it was normally proper for a court in such situations to order the government official in question to deliver the commission.[6] However, in Marbury's case, the Court did not order Madison to comply. Examining the law Congress had passed that gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction over types of cases like Marbury's, Marshall found that it had expanded the definition of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction beyond what was originally set down in the U.S. Constitution.[7] Marshall then struck down the law, announcing that American courts have the power to invalidate laws that it found to violate the Constitution.[8] Because this meant the Court had no jurisdiction over the case, it could not issue the writ that Marbury had requested.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fiercely contested U.S. presidential election of 1800, the three major candidates were  Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, and John Adams, who was the incumbent U.S. president.[1] Adams was aligned with the pro-business and pro-national-government politics of Alexander Hamilton and the Federalist Party, while Jefferson and Burr were part of the opposing Democratic-Republican Party, which favored agriculture and decentralization. American public opinion had gradually turned against the Federalists in the months prior to the election, mainly due to their use of the Alien and Sedition Acts as well as growing tensions with Great Britain, with whom the Federalists favored close ties.[9] Jefferson easily won the popular vote, but only narrowly defeated Adams in the Electoral College.[10][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the results of the election became clear in early 1801, Adams and the Federalists became determined to exercise their influence in the weeks remaining before Jefferson took office,[5] and did all they could to fill federal offices with \\"anti-Jeffersonians\\" who were loyal to the Federalists.[2] On March 2, 1801, just two days before his presidential term ended, Adams nominated nearly 60 Federalist supporters to circuit judge and justice of the peace positions the Federalist-controlled Congress had newly created. These last-minute nomineeswhom Jefferson's supporters derisively referred to as \\"the Midnight Judges\\"[11]included William Marbury, a prosperous businessman from Maryland. An ardent Federalist, Marbury was active in Maryland politics and had been a vigorous supporter of the Adams presidency.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day, March 3, the Senate approved Adams's nominations en masse. The appointees' commissions were immediately written out, then signed by Adams and sealed by his Secretary of State, John Marshall, who had been named the new Chief Justice of the United States in January but continued also serving as Secretary of State until Jefferson took office.[5][13] Marshall then dispatched his younger brother James Markham Marshall to deliver the commissions to the appointees.[5] With only one day left before Jefferson's inauguration, James Marshall was able to deliver most of the commissions, but a fewincluding Marbury'swere not delivered.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after, March 4, 1801, Thomas Jefferson was sworn in and became the 3rd President of the United States. As soon as he was able, Jefferson instructed his new Secretary of State, James Madison, to withhold the undelivered appointments.[5] In Jefferson's opinion, the commissions were void because they had not been delivered in time.[4] Without the commissions, the appointees were unable to assume the offices and duties to which they had been appointed. Over the next several months, Madison continually refused to deliver Marbury's commission to him. Finally, in December 1801, Marbury filed suit against Madison in the U.S. Supreme Court, asking the Court to issue a writ of mandamus forcing Madison to deliver Marbury's commission.[5] This lawsuit resulted in the case of Marbury v. Madison.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 24, 1803,[b] the Court rendered a unanimous (4ÿ0)[c] decision against Marbury. The Court's opinion was written by the Chief Justice, John Marshall. Marshall structured the Court's opinion around a series of three questions that Marshall answered in turn: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Court quickly answered the first two questions affirmatively.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, Marshall wrote that Marbury had a right to his commission because all appropriate procedures were followed?ÿ the commission had been properly signed and sealed.[6] Madison contended that the commissions were void if not delivered; the Court disagreed, and said that the delivery of the commission was merely a custom, not an essential element of the commission itself.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [President's] signature is a warrant for affixing the great seal to the commission, and the great seal is only to be affixed to an instrument which is complete. [...] The transmission of the commission is a practice directed by convenience, but not by law. It cannot therefore be necessary to constitute the appointment, which must precede it and which is the mere act of the President.\\r\\nBecause Marbury's commission was valid, Marshall wrote, Madison's withholding of it was \\"violative of a vested legal right\\" on Marbury's part.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning to the second question, the Court said that the laws clearly afforded Marbury a remedy. Marshall built upon the traditional Roman legal maxim ubi jus, ibi remedium (\\"where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy\\"), which was well established in the early Anglo-American common law.[16][17] In \\"one of the most important and inspiring passages\\" of the opinion, Marshall wrote: \\"The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws whenever he receives an injury.\\"[18] The specific issue, however, was whether the courtspart of the judicial branch of the governmentcould give Marbury a remedy against Madisonwho as Secretary of State was part of the executive branch of the government.[15] The Court held that so long as the remedy involved a mandatory duty to a specific person, and not a political matter left to discretion, the courts could provide the legal remedy.[15] In a now well-known line of the opinion, Marshall wrote: \\"The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter concluding that Marbury had a right to his commission and that a legal remedy existed to provide it to him, Marshall then confirmed that a writ of mandamusa type of court order that commands a government official to perform an act they are legally required to performwas the proper remedy for Marbury's situation.[20] This brought Marshall to the most important issue of the opinion: the propriety of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the matter, which would determine whether or not the Court had the power to issue the writ Marbury requested. Marbury had argued that the Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over his case.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court shall also have appellate jurisdiction from the circuit courts and courts of the several states, in the cases herein after specially provided for; and shall have power to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed, or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States.\\r\\nMarshall's discussion of this issue first explains the difference between original jurisdiction, in which a court has the power to be the first to hear and decide a case, and appellate jurisdiction, in which a party to a decision appeals to a higher court which has the power to review the previous decision and then either affirm or overturn it.[8] The Court agreed with Marbury, and interpreted the relevant section of the Judiciary Act to authorize mandamus on original jurisdiction.[7] However, Marshall noted that this authorization clashed with Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes the judicial branch of the U.S. government.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\\r\\nThis section of Article III of the Constitution establishes that the Supreme Court only has original jurisdiction over cases where a U.S. State is a party to the lawsuit, or where the lawsuit involves foreign dignitaries. Neither of these categories covered Marbury's justice of the peace commission, and so, according to the Constitution, the Court could only have heard Marbury's case while exercising appellate jurisdiction.[8][7] However, Marshall had interpreted the Judicial Act to have given the Court original jurisdiction over the matter: this meant that the Judicial Act apparently took the initial scope of the Supreme Court's original jurisdictionwhich was limited to cases either directly involving States or involving foreign dignitariesand expanded it to include issuing writs of mandamus. Marshall ruled that Congress cannot increase the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction as it was set down in the Constitution, and therefore that the relevant portion of Section 13 of the Judiciary Act violated Article III of the Constitution.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter ruling that it conflicted with the Constitution, Marshall struck down the relevant portion of the Judiciary Act in the U.S. Supreme Court's first ever declaration of the power of judicial review.[8][22] Marshall ruled that American federal courts have the power to refuse to give any effect to congressional legislation that is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Constitution does not explicitly give the American judiciary the power of judicial review.[24] Nevertheless, Marshall's opinion gives a number of reasons in support of the judiciary's possession of this power. Marshall stated that deciding the constitutionality of the laws it applies is an inherent part of the American judiciary's role.[7] Marshall reasoned that the Constitution places limits on the American government's powers, and that those limits would be meaningless unless they were subject to judicial review and enforcement.[25] In what has become the most frequently quoted line of the opinion, Marshall wrote: \\"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarshall reasoned that the Constitution's provisions limiting Congress's powersuch as the export tax clause, or the prohibitions on bills of attainder and ex post facto lawsmeant that in some cases judges would be forced to choose between enforcing the Constitution or following Congress.[27] Marshall held \\"virtually as a matter of iron logic\\" that in the event of conflict between the Constitution and statutory laws passed by Congress, the constitutional law must be supreme.[8] He further reasoned that the written nature of the Constitution inherently established judicial review.[28] In a line borrowed from Alexander Hamilton's essay Federalist No. 78, Marshall wrote: \\"The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written.\\"[29] In another argument borrowed from Federalist No. 78, Marshall stated that \\"a law repugnant to the Constitution is void\\", and that the judiciary had no choice but to follow the Constitution.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarshall also argued that the authorization in Article III of the Constitution that the Court can decide cases arising \\"under this Constitution\\" implied that the Court had the power to strike down laws conflicting with the Constitution.[25] This, Marshall wrote, meant that the Founders were willing to have the American judiciary use and interpret the Constitution when judging cases.[27] Lastly, Marshall argued that judicial review is implied in Article VI of the Constitution, since it declares the supreme law of the United States to be not the Constitution and the laws of the United States in general, but rather the Constitution and laws made \\"in Pursuance thereof\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from its legal issues, the case created a difficult political dilemma for Marshall and the rest of the Supreme Court.[32] If the Court ruled in favor of Marbury and issued a writ of mandamus ordering Madison to deliver the commission, Jefferson and Madison would probably have simply ignored the order, which would have made the Court look impotent and emphasized the \\"shakiness\\" of the judiciary.[32] On the other hand, a plain and simple ruling against Marbury would have given Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans a clear political victory.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarshall solved both problems. He ruled that Madison illegally withheld Marbury's commission, which gave the Federalists some comfort, but ultimately ruled against Marbury, giving a political victory to Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans. Then, in what the American constitutional law scholar Laurence Tribe described as an \\"awe-inspiring story\\", Marshall maneuvered Marbury's simple petition for a writ of mandamus into a question that went to heart of American constitutional law itself.[33] Marshall had been looking for a case that was suitable to introducing judicial review, and was eager to use the situation in Marbury to establish his claim.[34] He introduced judicial reviewa move Jefferson decriedbut used it to strike down a provision of a law that he read to have expanded the Supreme Court's powers.[31] Though Jefferson criticized Marshall's opinion, he accepted it, and Marshall's decision in Marbury \\"articulate[d] a role for the federal courts that survives to this day.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Marbury v. Madison] is a masterwork of indirection, a brilliant example of Marshall's capacity to sidestep danger while seeming to court it. [...] The danger of a head-on clash with the Jeffersonians was averted by the denial of jurisdiction: but, at the same time, the declaration that the commission was illegally withheld scotched any impression that the Court condoned the administration's behavior. These negative maneuvers were artful achievements in their own right. But the touch of genius is evident when Marshall, not content with having rescued a bad situation, seizes the occasion to set forth the doctrine of judicial review. It is easy for us to see in retrospect that the occasion was golden, [...] but only a judge of Marshall's discernment could have recognized it.\\r\\nIn the words of the American legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky: \\"The brilliance of Marshall's opinion cannot be overstated.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven its preeminent position in American constitutional law, Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in Marbury v. Madison continues to be the subject of critical analysis and historical inquiry.[36] In a 1955 Harvard Law Review article, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter emphasized that one can criticize Marshall's opinion in Marbury without demeaning it: \\"The courage of Marbury v. Madison is not minimized by suggesting that its reasoning is not impeccable and its conclusion, however wise, not inevitable.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nCriticisms of Marshall's opinion in Marbury usually fall into two general categories.[36] First, some criticize the way Marshall \\"strove\\" to reach the conclusion that the U.S. Supreme Court has constitutional authority over the other branches of the U.S. government. For example, American courts now generally follow the principle of \\"constitutional avoidance\\": if a certain interpretation of a law raises constitutional problems, they prefer to use alternative interpretations that avoid these problems. [38] In Marbury, Marshall could have avoided the constitutional questions through different legal rulings: for example, if he had ruled that Marbury did not have a right to his commission until it was delivered, or if he had ruled that refusals to honor political appointments could only be remedied through the political process and not the judicial process, the Court would not have reached the case's constitutional issues.[36] Marshall did not do so, and many scholars have criticized him for it.[38] However, other scholars have noted that the \\"constitutional avoidance\\" principle did not exist in 1803, and in any case is \\"only a general guide for Court action and not an ironclad precept.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, Marshall's arguments for the Court's authority are sometimes said to be mere \\"assertions of authority\\", rather than substantive reasons logically laid out to support his position.[36] It is generally agreed that Marshall's series of assertions regarding the U.S. Constitution and the actions of the other branches of government do not \\"inexorably lead to the conclusion that Marshall draws from them\\".[39] Marshall's assertion of the American judiciary's authority to review executive branch actions was the most controversial issue when Marbury was first decided, and several subsequent U.S. presidents have tried to dispute it, to varying degrees.[39] However, the power of judicial review is now widely accepted and firmly established in American law.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, it is questionable whether Marshall should have participated in the Marbury case because of his participating role in the dispute.[14] Marshall was still the acting Secretary of State when the nominations were made, and he himself had signed Marbury and the other men's commissions and had been responsible for their delivery.[14] This potential conflict of interest raises strong grounds for Marshall to have recused himself from the case.[14] In hindsight, the fact that Marshall did not recuse himself from Marbury is likely indicative of his eagerness to hear the case and use it to establish judicial review.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarbury v. Madison remains the single most important decision in American constitutional law.[1] To this day, the Supreme Court's power to review the constitutionality of American laws at both the federal and state level \\"is generally rested upon the epic decision of Marbury v. Madison.\\"[41] However, Marshall's decision did not invent judicial review: 18th-century British jurists had debated whether courts could circumscribe Parliament, and the principle became generally accepted in Colonial Americaespecially in Marshall's native Virginia[42]due to the idea that in America only the people were sovereign, rather than the government, and therefore that the courts should only implement legitimate laws.[43] By the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, American courts' \\"independent power and duty to interpret the law\\" was well established.[44] Nevertheless, Marshall's opinion in Marbury was the power's first announcement and exercise by the Supreme Court. It made the practice more routine, rather than exceptional, and prepared the way for the Court's opinion in the 1819 case McCulloch v. Maryland, in which Marshall implied that the Supreme Court was the supreme interpreter of the U.S. Constitution.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarbury also established that the power of judicial review covers actions by the executive branch ÿ the President and his cabinet members.  However, American courts' power of judicial review over executive branch actions only extends to matters in which the executive has a legal duty to act or refrain from acting, and does not extend to matters that are entirely within the President's discretion, such as whether to veto a bill or whom to appoint to an office.[21] This power has been the basis of many subsequent important Supreme Court decisions in American history, such as the 1974 case United States v. Nixon, in which the Court held that President Richard Nixon was required to comply with a subpoena to provide tapes of his conversations for use in a criminal trial related to the Watergate scandal, and which ultimately led to Nixon's resignation.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it is a potent check on the other branches of the U.S. government, the power of judicial review was rarely exercised in early American history. After deciding Marbury in 1803, the U.S. Supreme Court did not strike down another federal law until 1857, when the Court struck down the Missouri Compromise in the now-infamous case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, a ruling that contributed to the outbreak of the American Civil War.[31]","input":"What did the supreme court decision in marbury v madison establish?"},{"output":"Tenerife","context":"The First Fleet is the name given to the 11 ships that left England on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a vast quantity of stores. From England, the Fleet sailed southwest to Rio de Janeiro, then east to Cape Town and via the Great Southern Ocean to Botany Bay, arriving over the period of 18 to 20 January 1788, taking 250 to 252 days from departure to final arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvicts were originally transported to the Thirteen Colonies in North America, but after the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the newly formed United States refused to accept further convicts.[1] On 6 December 1785, Orders in Council were issued in London for the establishment of a penal colony in New South Wales, on land claimed for Britain by explorer James Cook in his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770.[2][3]\\r\\nThe First Fleet was commanded by Commodore Arthur Phillip, who was given instructions authorising him to make regulations and land grants in the colony.[4] The ships arrived at Botany Bay between 18 January and 20 January 1788:[5] HMS Supply arrived on 18 January, Alexander, Scarborough and Friendship arrived on 19 January, and the remaining ships on 20 January.[6][7]\\r\\nThe cost to Britain of outfitting and despatching the Fleet was S84,000[8] (about S9.6 million as of 2015).[9]\\r\\nThe First Fleet included two Royal Navy escort ships, the ten-gun sixth-rate vessel HMS?Sirius under the command of Captain John Hunter, and the armed tender HMS?Supply commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.\\r\\nRopes, crockery, agricultural equipment and a miscellany of other stores were needed. Items transported included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and a prefabricated wooden frame for the colony's first Government House.[12] The party had to rely on its own provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and grow its own food and raise livestock.\\r\\nScale models of all the ships are on display at the Museum of Sydney. The models were built by ship makers Lynne and Laurie Hadley, after researching the original plans, drawings and British archives. The replicas of the Supply, Charlotte, Scarborough, Friendship, Prince of Wales, Lady Penrhyn, Borrowdale, Alexander, Sirius?(1786), Fishburn and Golden Grove are made from Western Red or Syrian Cedar.[13]\\r\\nNine Sydney harbour ferries built in the mid-1980s are named after First Fleet vessels. The unused names are Lady Penrhyn and Prince of Wales.\\r\\nThe people of the fleet included seamen, marines and their families, government officials, and a large number of convicts, including women and children. The majority were British, but there were also African, American and French convicts on board.[14][15] The convicts had committed a variety of crimes, including theft, perjury, fraud, assault and robbery, for which they had been sentenced to penal transportation for 7 years, 14 years or the term of their natural life.[16][17]\\r\\nThe six convict transports each had a detachment of marines on board. Most of the families of the marines travelled aboard the Prince of Wales.[18] A number of people on the First Fleet kept diaries and journals of their experiences, including the surgeons. There are twelve known journals in existence as well as some letters.[19]\\r\\nThe exact number of people directly associated with the First Fleet will likely never be established, as all accounts of the event vary slightly. A total of 1,420 people have been identified as embarking on the First Fleet in 1787, and 1,373 are believed to have landed at Sydney Cove in January 1788. In her biographical dictionary of the First Fleet, Mollie Gillen gives the following statistics:[20]\\r\\nWhile the names of all crew members of Sirius and Supply are known, the six transports and three storeships may have carried as many as 110 more seamen than have been identified ÿ no complete musters have survived for these ships. The total number of persons embarking on the First Fleet would, therefore, be approximately 1,530 with about 1,483 reaching Sydney Cove.\\r\\nOther sources indicate that the passengers consisted of 10 civil officers, 212 marines, including officers, 28 wives and 17 children of the marines, 81 free people, 504 male convicts and 192 female convicts; making the total number of free people 348 and the total number of prisoners 696, coming to a grand total of 1,044 people.\\r\\nAccording to the first census of 1788 as reported by Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, the white population of the colony was 1,030 and the colony also consisted of 7 horses, 29 sheep, 74 swine, 6 rabbits, and 7 cattle.[21]\\r\\nThe following statistics were provided by Governor Phillip:[22]\\r\\nDavid Collins' book An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales gives the following details:[23]\\r\\nThe Alexander, of 453 tons, had on board 192 male convicts; 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 29 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Scarborough, of 418 tons, had on board 205 male convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 26 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Charlotte, of 346 tons, had on board 89 male and 20 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 35 privates, with the principal surgeon of the colony.\\r\\nThe Lady Penrhyn, of 338 tons, had on board 101 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 3 privates, with a person acting as a surgeon's mate.\\r\\nThe Prince of Wales, of 334 tons, had on board 2 male and 50 female convicts; 2 lieutenants, 3 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 24 privates, with the surveyor-general of the colony.\\r\\nThe Friendship,  of 228 tons, had on board 76 male and 21 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 36 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThere were on board, beside these, 28 women, 8 male and 6 female children, belonging to the soldiers of the detachment, together with 6 male and 7 female children belonging to the convicts.\\r\\nThe Fishburn store-ship was of 378 tons; the Borrowdale of 272 tons; and the Golden Grove of 331 tons. Golden Grove carried the chaplain for the colony, with his wife and a servant.\\r\\nNot only these store-ships, but the men of war and transports were laden with provisions, implements of agriculture, camp equipage, clothing for the convicts, baggage, etc.\\r\\nThe Sirius carried as supernumeraries, the major commandant of the corps of marines embarked in the transports* [*This officer was also lieutenant-governor of the colony], the adjutant and quarter-master, the judge-advocate of the settlement, and the commissary; with one sergeant, three drummers, seven privates, four women, and a few artificers.\\r\\nThe chief surgeon for the First Fleet, John White, reported a total of 48 deaths and 28 births during the voyage. The deaths during the voyage included one marine, one marine's wife, one marine's child, 36 male convicts, four female convicts, and five children of convicts.[24]\\r\\nThe First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787.[25] The journey began with fine weather, and thus the convicts were allowed on deck.[26] The Fleet was accompanied by the armed frigate Hyena until it left English waters.[27] On 20 May 1787, one convict on the Scarborough reported a planned mutiny; those allegedly involved were flogged and two were transferred to Prince of Wales.[27] In general, however, most accounts of the voyage agree that the convicts were well behaved.[27] On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife.[25] Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape.[28] On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro,[25] taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\\r\\nThe weather became increasingly hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, and parasites such as bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering.[29] While Phillip gave orders that the bilge-water was to be pumped out daily and the bilges cleaned, these orders were not followed on the Alexander and a number of convicts fell sick and died.[29] Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing.[29] Consequently, they were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts, the crew and marines was rampant, despite punishments for some of the men involved.[29] In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.[29]\\r\\nThe Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August and stayed for a month.[25] The ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, and Phillip ordered large quantities of food.[26] The women convicts' clothing had become infested with lice and was burnt. As additional clothing for the female convicts had not arrived before the Fleet left England,[26] the women were issued with new clothes made from rice sacks. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants.[30] A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons.\\r\\nThe Fleet left Rio de Janeiro on 4 September to run before the westerlies to the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, which it reached on 13 October.[31] This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock for their arrival in Australia.[32] The livestock taken on board from the Cape of Good Hope destined for the new colony included two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and \\"a very large quantity of poultry of every kind\\".[33] Women convicts on the Friendship were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The convicts were provided with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables, to build up their strength for the journey and maintain their health.[32] The Dutch colony of Cape Town was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for the rest of their lives. \\"Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.\\"[34]\\r\\nAssisted by the gales in the \\"Roaring Forties\\" latitudes below the 40th parallel, the heavily laden transports surged through the violent seas. In the last two months of the voyage, the Fleet faced challenging conditions, spending some days becalmed and on others covering significant distances; the Friendship travelled 166 miles one day, while a seaman was blown from the Prince of Wales at night and drowned.[35] Water was rationed as supplies ran low, and the supply of other goods including wine ran out altogether on some vessels.[35] Van Diemen's Land was sighted from the Friendship on 4 January 1788.[35] A freak storm struck as they began to head north around the island, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.\\r\\nOn 25 November, Phillip had transferred to the Supply. With Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, the fastest ships in the Fleet, which were carrying most of the male convicts, the Supply hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. Phillip intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other structures built before the others arrived. This was a planned move, discussed by the Home Office and the Admiralty prior to the Fleet's departure.[36] However, this \\"flying squadron\\" reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible.[37] Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788; the three fastest transports in the advance group arrived on 19 January; slower ships, including Sirius, arrived on 20 January.[38]\\r\\nThis was one of the world's greatest sea voyages ÿ eleven vessels carrying about 1,487 people and stores[33] had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles (24,000?km) without losing a ship. Forty-eight people died on the journey, a death rate of just over three per cent.\\r\\nIt was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that the explorer Captain James Cook had provided.[39] The bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor.[40] First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines had a habit of getting drunk and not guarding the convicts properly, whilst their commander, Major Robert Ross, drove Phillip to despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary.[41]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Phillip and a party which included John Hunter, departed the Bay in three small boats to explore other bays to the north.[43] Phillip discovered that Port Jackson, about 12 kilometres to the north, was an excellent site for a colony with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil.[43] Cook had seen and named the harbour, but had not entered it.[43] Phillip's impressions of the harbour were recorded in a letter he sent to England later: \\"the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security ...\\". The party returned to Botany Bay on 23 January.[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of 24 January, the party was startled when two French ships were seen just outside Botany Bay. This was a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse. The French had expected to find a thriving colony where they could repair ships and restock supplies, not a newly arrived fleet of convicts considerably more poorly provisioned than themselves.[44] There was some cordial contact between the French and British officers, but Phillip and La Prouse never met. The French ships remained until 10 March before setting sail on their return voyage. They were not seen again and were later discovered to have been shipwrecked off the coast of Vanikoro in the present-day Solomon Islands.[45]\\r\\nOn 26 January 1788, the Fleet weighed anchor and sailed to Port Jackson.[25] The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary.[43] This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement.[46] The British flag was planted and formal possession taken. This was done by Phillip and some officers and marines from the Supply, with the remainder of Supply's crew and the convicts observing from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet did not arrive at Sydney Cove until later that day.[47]\\r\\nThe First Fleet encountered indigenous Australians when they landed at Botany Bay. The Cadigal people of the Botany Bay area witnessed the Fleet arrive and six days later the two ships of French explorer La Prouse sailed into the bay.[48] When the Fleet moved to Sydney Cove seeking better conditions for establishing the colony, they encountered the Eora people, including the Bidjigal clan. A number of the First Fleet journals record encounters with Aboriginal people.[49]\\r\\nAlthough the official policy of the British Government was to establish friendly relations with Aboriginal people,[41] and Arthur Phillip ordered that the Aboriginal people should be well treated, it was not long before conflict began. The colonists did not understand Aboriginal society and its relationship with the land and the Aboriginal people did not understand the British practices of farming and land ownership. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land.[50] Between 1790 and 1810, Pemulwuy of the Bidjigal clan led the local people in a series of attacks against the British colonisers.[51]\\r\\nThe ships of the First Fleet mostly did not remain in the colony. Some returned to England, while others left for other ports. Some remained at the service of the Governor of the colony for some months: some of these were sent to Norfolk Island where a second penal colony was established.\\r\\n1788\\r\\n1789\\r\\n1790:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1842, the Colonial Government in Sydney awarded a life pension of 1 shilling a day to three surviving members of the First Fleet. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported, on Saturday 29 January 1842: \\"The Government have ordered a pension of one shilling per diem to be paid to the survivors of those who came by the first vessel into the Colony. The number of these really 'old hands' is now reduced to three, of whom, two are now in the Benevolent Asylum, and the other is a fine hale old fellow, who can do a day's work with more spirit than many of the young fellows lately arrived in the Colony.\\"[53] The names of the three recipients are not given.\\r\\nWilliam Hubbard: Hubbard was convicted in the Kingston Assizes in Surrey, England, on 24 March 1784 for theft.[54] He was transported to Australia on the Scarborough in the First Fleet. He married Mary Goulding on 19 December 1790 in Rose Hill. In 1803 he received a land grant of 70 acres at Mulgrave Place. He died on 18 May 1843 at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. His age was given as 76 when he was buried at Christ Church St. Lawrence, Sydney on 22 May 1843.\\r\\nJohn McCarthy: McCarthy was a Marine who sailed on the Friendship.[55] McCarthy was born in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, circa Christmas 1745. He first served in the colony of New South Wales, then at Norfolk Island where he took up a land grant of 60 acres (Lot 110). He married the first fleet convict Ann Beardsley on Norfolk Island in November 1791 after his discharge a month earlier. In 1808, on the close of Norfolk Island settlement, he resettled in Van Diemen's Land and later took a land grant (80 acres at Melville) in lieu of the one forfeited on Norfolk Island. The last few years of his life were spent at the home of his granddaughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Budd, at a place called Kinlochewe Inn near Donnybrook, Victoria. McCarthy died on 24 July 1846,[56] six months past his 100 birthday.\\r\\nJohn Limeburner: The South Australian Register reported, in an article dated Wednesday 3 November 1847: \\"John Limeburner, the oldest colonist in Sydney, died in September last, at the advanced age of 104 years. He helped to pitch the first tent in Sydney, and remembered the first display of the British flag there, which was hoisted on a swamp oak-tree, then growing on a spot now occupied as the Water-Police Court. He was the last of those called the 'first-fleeters' (arrivals by the first convict ships) and, notwithstanding his great age, retained his faculties to the last.\\"[57] John Limeburner was a convict on the Charlotte. He was convicted on 9 July 1785 at New Sarum, Wiltshire of theft of a waistcoat, a shirt and stockings.[58] He married Elizabeth Ireland in 1790 at Rosehill and together they establish a 50-acre farm at Prospect.[59] He died at Ashfield in September 1847 and is buried at St John's, Ashfield.\\r\\nJohn Jones: Jones was a Marine on the First Fleet and sailed on the Alexander. He is listed in the N.S.W. 1828 Census as aged 82 and living at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum.[60] He is said to have died at the Benevolent Asylum in 1848.[61]\\r\\nSamuel King: King was a scribbler (a worker in a scribbling mill[62]) before he became a Marine. He was a Marine with the First Fleet on board the flagship Sirius?(1786).[63] He shipped to Norfolk Island on Golden Grove in September 1788, where he lived with Mary Rolt, a convict who arrived with the First Fleet on the Prince of Wales. He received a grant of 60 acres (Lot No. 13) at Cascade Stream in 1791. Mary Rolt returned to England on the Britannia in October 1796. King was resettled in Van Diemen's Land, boarding the City of Edinburgh on 3 September 1808, and landed in Hobart on 3 October.[64] He married Elizabeth Thackery on 28 January 1810. He died on 21 October 1849 at 86 years of age and was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery at Lawitta Road, Back River.\\r\\nJohn Small: Convicted 14 March 1785 at the Devon Lent Assizes held at Exeter for Robbery King's Highway. Sentenced to hang, reprieved to 7 years transportation. Arrived on the Charlotte in First Fleet 1788. Certificate of freedom 1792. Land Grant 1794, 30 acre \\"Small's Farm\\" at Eastern Farms (Ryde). Married October 1788 Mary Parker also a First Fleet convict who arrived on Lady Penrhyn. John Small died on 2 October 1850 at age of 90 years.[65][66]\\r\\nElizabeth Thackery: Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" King (ne Thackery) was tried and convicted of theft on 4 May 1786 at Manchester Quarter Sessions, and sentenced to seven years transportation. She sailed on the Friendship, but was transferred to the Charlotte at the Cape of Good Hope. She was shipped to Norfolk Island on the Sirius?(1786) in 1790 and lived there with James Dodding. In August 1800 she bought 10 acres of land from Samuel King at Cascade Stream. Elizabeth and James were relocated to Van Diemen's Land in December 1807[67] but parted company sometime afterwards. On 28 January 1810 Elizabeth married \\"First Fleeter\\" Private Samuel King (above) and lived with him until his death in 1849. Betty King died in New Norfolk, Tasmania on 7 August 1856, aged 89 years. She is buried in the churchyard of the Methodist Chapel, Lawitta Road, Back River, next to her husband, and the marked grave bears a First Fleet plaque. She was one of the first British women to land in Australia and was the last \\"First Fleeter\\" to die.\\r\\nHistorians have disagreed over whether those aboard the First Fleet were responsible for introducing smallpox to Australia's indigenous population, and if so, whether this was the consequence of deliberate action.\\r\\nIn 1914, J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[68] Some researchers have argued that any such release may have been a deliberate attempt to decimate the indigenous population.[69][70] Others have suggested that live smallpox virus may have been introduced accidentally, when Aboriginal people came into contact with variolous matter brought by the First Fleet for use in anti-smallpox inoculations.[71][72][73] Hypothetical scenarios for such an action might have included: an act of revenge by an aggrieved individual, a response to attacks by indigenous people,[74] or part of an orchestrated assault by the New South Wales Marine Corps, intended to clear the path for colonial expansion.[75][76]\\r\\nOther historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet.[77][78][79][80][81] In 2002, historian Judy Campbell suggested that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic.[79][82] In 2011, Macknight stated: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepangers ... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[83]\\r\\nThere is a third theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox ÿ to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance ÿ that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet.[84][85] This theory has also been disputed.[86][87]\\r\\nAfter Ray Collins, a stonemason, completed years of research into the First Fleet, he sought approval from about nine councils to construct a commemorative garden in recognition of these immigrants. Liverpool Plains Shire Council was ultimately the only council to accept his offer to supply the materials and construct the garden free of charge. The site chosen was a disused caravan park on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. In September 2002 Collins commenced work on the project. Additional support was later provided by Neil McGarry in the form of some signs and the council contributed $28,000 for pathways and fencing. Collins hand-chiseled the names of all those who came to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on stone tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.[88] On 26 January 2005, the First Fleet Garden was opened as the major memorial to the First Fleet immigrants. Previously the only other specific memorial to the First Fleeters was an obelisk at Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales.[89] The surrounding area has a barbecue, tables, and amenities.","input":"When did the first fleet arrive in tenerife?"},{"output":"August 21, 2017","context":"During the 21st century, there will be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be annular, 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses.

He was the first human to journey into outer space when his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth on 12 April 1961.\\r\\nGagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation's highest honour. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when the MiG-15 training jet he was piloting crashed. The Fdration Aronautique Internationale awards the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino, near Gzhatsk (renamed Gagarin in 1968 after his death), on 9 March 1934.[1] His parents worked on a collective farm:[2] Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and bricklayer, and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a milkmaid.[note 2][3] Yuri was the third of four children: older brother Valentin, older sister Zoya, and younger brother Boris.[4]\\r\\nLike millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10?ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[5] His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war in 1945.[4][6] In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.[5]\\r\\nIn 1950, Gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age 16 as a foundryman at the Lyubertsy Steel Plant near Moscow,[4][6] and also enrolled at a local \\"young workers\\" school for seventh grade evening classes.[7] After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school with honours in moldmaking and foundry work,[7] he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors.[4][6][8] While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly  at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer.[6][8] He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.[5]\\r\\nAfter graduating from the technical school in 1955, the Soviet Army drafted Gagarin.[7] On a recommendation, Gagarin was sent to the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, and soloed in a MiG-15 in 1957.[4][6][7] After graduation, he was assigned to the Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Forces on 5 November 1957; on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.[9]\\r\\nIn 1960, after an extensive search and selection process, Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six, from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics? space was limited in the small Vostok cockpit, and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in) tall.[2]\\r\\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, a Soviet Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\\r\\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.[10]\\r\\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.[11] One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.[12]\\r\\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\\r\\nService in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper... I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[13]\\r\\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being a referee.[14]\\r\\nOn 12 April 1961, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: 椿, Siberian pine or Cedar).[15]\\r\\nThe radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:\\r\\nKorolev: \\"Preliminary stage..... intermediate..... main..... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.\\"\\r\\nGagarin: \\"楾!\\" (Poyekhali!Let's go!).[16]\\r\\nGagarin's informal poyekhali! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc, used to refer to the beginning of the Space Age in human history.[17][18]\\r\\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\\r\\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.[19]\\r\\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune \\"The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows\\" (Russian: \\"˾ҷ ְ, ˾ҷ \\").[20][21] The first two lines of the song are: \\"The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky\\".[22] This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\\r\\nSome sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, \\"I don't see any God up here.\\" However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight.[23] In a 2006 interview, Gagarin's friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words, and that the quote originated from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state's anti-religion campaign, saying \\"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any god there.\\"[24] Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child, and a 2011 Foma magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox church in Star City saying, \\"Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house.\\"[25]\\r\\nGagarin's flight was a triumph for the Soviet space program. The announcement on the Soviet radio was made by Yuri Levitan, the same speaker who announced all major events in the Great Patriotic War. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of Moscow to the Kremlin where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, by Nikita Khrushchev.[26]\\r\\nLater on, Gagarin toured widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Egypt[27] and Finland to promote the Soviet Union's accomplishment of putting the first human in space. He visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 mission, going to London and Manchester.[28][29]\\r\\nThe sudden rise to fame took its toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a \\"sensible drinker\\", his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.[4][8]\\r\\nIn 1962, he began serving as a Deputy to the Soviet of the Union,[30] and was elected to the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Forces on 12 June 1962, and received the rank of colonel on 6 November 1963.[9] Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin's protests that additional safety precautions were necessary.[31] When Komarov's flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\\r\\nOn 20 December 1963, Gagarin had become Deputy Training Director of the Star City cosmonaut training base.[32] Two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the SSSU, but this time to the Soviet of Nationalities.[30] Next year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot.[33] On 17 February 1968 he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration, passing with flying colors.[34][35]\\r\\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\\r\\nGagarin is survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Yelena and Galina.\\r\\nThe cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.\\r\\nSoviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.[36]\\r\\nAnother theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.[37] A similar theory, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.[38]\\r\\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.[39]\\r\\nIn April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified. Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a \\"super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,\\" or to avoid \\"entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover\\".[40]\\r\\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov, who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard \\"two loud booms in the distance.\\" Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 'Flagon') was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and \\"without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier.\\" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing.[41] In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network RT, Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, \\"unauthorized\\" Su-15 flying in the area. Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres (1,480?ft) and that, while running afterburners, \\"the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10ÿ15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin ÿ a deep spiral, to be precise ÿ at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\\" As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health.[42][43]\\r\\nIn 1957, while at the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, Gagarin met Valentina Ivanovna Goryacheva,[3] a medical technician graduate of the Orenburg Medical School.[6][8] They were married on 7 November 1957, the same day Gagarin graduated from Orenburg, and they have two daughters.[3][6]\\r\\nYelena Yurievna Gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the Director-General of the Moscow Kremlin Museums since 2001.[44][45]\\r\\nGalina Yurievna Gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow.[44][46]\\r\\nAside from his short stature at 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in), one of Gagarin's most notable traits was his smile.[47] Many commented on how Gagarin's smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success.[29]\\r\\nGagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him. Gagarin stated, \\"If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I.\\" Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.[29]\\r\\nSergei Korolev, one of the masterminds behind the early years of the Soviet space program, later said that Gagarin possessed a smile \\"that lit up the Cold War\\".[48]\\r\\n12 April, the date of Gagarin's space flight, has been commemorated as a special date. Since 1962, it has been celebrated in the USSR and later in Russia and other post-Soviet states as the Cosmonautics Day. In 2011 it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.[49]\\r\\nSince 2001, Yuri's Night, an international celebration, is held every 12 April to commemorate milestones in space exploration.\\r\\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin. The Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City was named in 1969. The launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome from which Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1 were launched, is now known as Gagarin's Start. Gagarin Raion in the Sevastopol city (Ukraine) was named after him during the period of the Soviet Union. The Air Force Academy was renamed Gagarin Air Force Academy in 1968.\\r\\nGagarin has been honored on the Moon by both astronauts and astronomers. He was honored by the American space program during Apollo 11 in 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left a memorial satchel containing medals commemorating Gagarin and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on the surface.[50][51] In 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin left the Fallen Astronaut at their landing site as a memorial to all the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who died in the Space Race, with Yuri Gagarin listed among 14 others.[52][53] He is memorialized by the official naming of a 265?km crater on the Far Side after him.\\r\\nGagarin is memorialized in music, including a cycle of Soviet patriotic songs The Constellation Gagarin (Russian: Ѿ־^ ҷ, tr. Sozvezdie Gagarina) was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov in 1970ÿ1971.[54] The most famous of these songs referred to Gagarin's poyekhali!: He said \\"let's go!\\" He waved his hand.[17][54] He was the inspiration for the pieces \\"Hey Gagarin\\" by Jean Michel Jarre (on Mtamorphoses), \\"Gagarin\\" by Public Service Broadcasting, and \\"Gagarin, I loved you\\" by Undervud.\\r\\nVessels have been named for him. Soviet tracking ship Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin was built in 1971. Armenian airline Armavia named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin's honour in 2011.[55]\\r\\nThere were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to honour the 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver).[56] In 2011, Russia issued a 1,000 ruble coin (gold) and 3 ruble coin (silver) to mark the 50th anniversary of his flight.[57]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Kontinental Hockey League named their championship trophy the Gagarin Cup.[58] In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the #6 most popular space hero, tied with Star Trek's fictional Capt. James T. Kirk.[59] The Russian docudrama, Gagarin: First in Space, was released in 2013.\\r\\nSeveral statues have been erected in his honor.\\r\\nOn 4 June 1980, a monument to Gagarin was opened on Gagarin Square in Leninsky Avenue, Moscow. The monument is 42.4 m tall and constructed of titanium. Beside the column is a replica of the descent module used by Gagarin.\\r\\nIn 2011 a statue, Yuri Gagarin, was unveiled at the Admiralty Arch end of The Mall in London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Cook. It is a copy of the statue outside Gagarin's former school in Lyubertsy.[60] In 2013 the statue was moved to a permanent location outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.[61]\\r\\nIn 2012 a statue was unveiled at the site of NASA's original spaceflight headquarters on South Wayside Drive in Houston. The sculpture, completed in 2011 by artist/cosmonaut Alexsei Leonov, was a gift to Houston by various Russian organisations. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were present for the dedication.[62]\\r\\nIn April 2018 a bust of Gagarin, erected on the street which bears his name in the Serbian capital Belgrade, was removed, after less than week, following an outcry over the size of its head. Locals said that the tribute, was an \\"insult\\" to Gagarin. A new work will be commissioned.[63] It was revealed that the city had had no prior knowledge of the design, and neither had the Serbian Ministry of Culture, nor the foundation which had financed it.[64]\\r\\nApart from these, Gagarin has also statues and monuments for example in Karaganda, Orenburg, Izhevsk, Gagarin-Smolensk Oblast, Yoshkar-Ola, Cheboksary, Druzhkivka, Tiraspol, Irkutsk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur and Nicosia.\\r\\nThe 50th anniversary of Gagarin's journey into space was marked in 2011 by tributes around the world. A film titled First Orbit was shot from the International Space Station, combining the original flight audio with footage of the route taken by Gagarin.[65] The Russian, American, and Italian Expedition 27 crew aboard the ISS sent a special video message to wish the people of the world a \\"Happy Yuri's Night\\", wearing shirts with an image of Gagarin.[66]\\r\\nSwiss-based German watchmaker Bernhard Lederer created a limited edition of 50 Gagarin Tourbillons to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight.[67]\\r\\nThe launch of Soyuz TMA-21 on 4 April 2011 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first manned space mission.[68]\\r\\nand others.\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was elected an honorary citizen of the following cities:\\r\\nHe was also awarded the golden keys to the gates of the Egyptian cities Cairo and Alexandria.","input":"Who was the first human sent into space?"},{"output":"a Western culture, derived primarily from Britain","context":"","input":"What is the most common culture in australia?"},{"output":"limestone","context":"The Great Sphinx of Giza (Arabic: ??? ??????? Ab al-Haul, English: The Terrifying One; literally: Father of Dread), commonly referred to as the Sphinx of Giza or just the Sphinx, is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human.[1] Facing directly from West to East, it stands on the Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx is generally believed to represent the Pharaoh Khafre.[2]\\r\\nCut from the bedrock, the original shape of the Sphinx has been restored with layers of blocks.[3] It measures 238 feet (73?m) long from paw to tail, 66.3?ft (20.21?m) high from the base to the top of the head and 62.6 feet (19?m) wide at its rear haunches.[4] It is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt and is commonly believed to have been built by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of the Pharaoh Khafre (c. 2558ÿ2532?BC).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sphinx is a monolith carved into the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area.[6] The nummulitic limestone of the area consists of layers which offer differing resistance to erosion (mostly caused by wind and windblown sand), leading to the uneven degradation apparent in the Sphinx's body.[6][7] The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock.[1] The body of the lion up to its neck is fashioned from softer layers that have suffered considerable disintegration.[8] The layer in which the head was sculpted is much harder.[8][9]\\r\\nThe Great Sphinx is one of the world's largest and oldest statues, but basic facts about it are still subject to debate, such as when it was built, by whom and for what purpose.[1] These questions have resulted in the popular idea of the \\"Riddle of the Sphinx,\\"[10] alluding to the original Greek legend of the \\"Riddle of the Sphinx.\\"\\r\\nFirst century writer Pliny the Elder mentioned the Great Sphinx in his Natural History, commenting that the Egyptians looked upon the statue as a \\"divinity\\" that has been passed over in silence and \\"that King Harmais was buried in it.\\"[9][11]\\r\\nIt is impossible to identify what name the creators called their statue, as the Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the Old Kingdom and there are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was called Hor-em-akhet (English: Horus of the Horizon; Hellenized: Harmachis), and the pharaoh Thutmose?IV (1401ÿ1391 or 1397ÿ1388?BC)[12] specifically referred to it as such in his \\"Dream Stele.\\"\\r\\nThe commonly used name \\"Sphinx\\" was given to it in classical antiquity, about 2000 years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a Greek mythological beast with a lion's body, a woman's head and the wings of an eagle (although, like most Egyptian sphinxes, the Great Sphinx has a man's head and no wings).[13] The English word sphinx comes from the ancient Greek ҷ? (transliterated: sphinx) apparently from the verb ? (transliterated: sphingo / English: to squeeze), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle.\\r\\nThe name may alternatively be a linguistic corruption of the phonetically different ancient Egyptian word Ssp-anx (in Manuel de Codage). This name is given to royal statues of the Fourth dynasty of ancient Egypt (2575ÿ2467?BC) and later in the New Kingdom (c. 1570ÿ1070?BC) to the Great Sphinx more specifically.[original research?]\\r\\nMedieval Arab writers, including al-Maqrؐzؐ, call the Sphinx balhib and bilhaw, which suggest a Coptic influence. The modern Egyptian Arabic name is ??? ????? (Ab al Hl, English: The Terrifying One).\\r\\nThough there have been conflicting evidence and viewpoints over the years, the view held by modern Egyptology at large remains that the Great Sphinx was built in approximately 2500?BC for the pharaoh Khafra, the builder of the Second Pyramid at Giza.[14]\\r\\nSelim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, summed up the problem:\\r\\nTaking all things into consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this, the world's most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this reservation: that there is not one single contemporary inscription which connects the Sphinx with Khafre; so, sound as it may appear, we must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as a lucky turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a definite reference to the erection of the Sphinx.[15]\\r\\nThe \\"circumstantial\\" evidence mentioned by Hassan includes the Sphinx's location in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which is traditionally connected with Khafra.[16] Apart from the Causeway, the Pyramid and the Sphinx, the complex also includes the Sphinx Temple and the Valley Temple, both of which display the same architectural style, with 200-tonne stone blocks quarried out of the Sphinx enclosure.\\r\\nA diorite statue of Khafre, which was discovered buried upside down along with other debris in the Valley Temple, is claimed as support for the Khafra theory.\\r\\nThe Dream Stele, erected much later by the pharaoh Thutmose?IV (1401ÿ1391 or 1397ÿ1388?BC), associates the Sphinx with Khafra. When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete, and only referred to Khaf, not Khafra. An extract was translated:\\r\\nwhich we bring for him: oxen?... and all the young vegetables; and we shall give praise to Wenofer ... Khaf ... the statue made for Atum-Hor-em-Akhet.[17]\\r\\nThe Egyptologist Thomas Young, finding the Khaf hieroglyphs in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name, inserted the glyph ra to complete Khafra's name. When the Stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to Khaf flaked off and were destroyed.\\r\\nTheories held by academic Egyptologists regarding the builder of the Sphinx and the date of its construction are not universally accepted, and various persons have proposed various alternative hypotheses about both the builder and the dating.\\r\\nSome early Egyptologists and excavators of the Giza pyramid complex believed the Great Sphinx and associated temples to predate the fourth dynasty rule of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. Petrie wrote in 1883 regarding the state of opinion regarding the age of the nearby temples, and by extension the Sphinx: \\"The date of the Granite Temple [Valley Temple] has been so positively asserted to be earlier than the fourth dynasty, that it may seem rash to dispute the point\\".[18]\\r\\nIn 1857, Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, unearthed the much later Inventory Stela (estimated Dynasty?XXVI, c.?678ÿ525?BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the Stela are considered good evidence,[19] this passage is widely dismissed as Late Period historical revisionism,[20] a purposeful fake, created by the local priests with the attempt to certify the contemporary Isis temple an ancient history it never had. Such an act became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines and priest's domains were fighting for political attention and for financial and economic donations.[21][22]\\r\\nGaston Maspero, the French Egyptologist and second director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, conducted a survey of the Sphinx in 1886. He concluded that because the Dream stela showed the cartouche of Khafre in line thirteen, that it was he who was responsible for the excavation and that the Sphinx must therefore predate Khafre and his predecessors (i.e. Dynasty?IV, c. 2575ÿ2467?BC).[23] English Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge agreed that the Sphinx predated Khafre's reign, writing in The Gods of the Egyptians (1914): \\"This marvelous object [the Great Sphinx] was in existence in the days of Khafre, or Khephren,[a] and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period [c. 2686 BC].\\"[24] Maspero believed the Sphinx to be \\"the most ancient monument in Egypt\\".[25]\\r\\nRainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the nemes (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded that the style is more indicative of the Pharaoh Khufu (2589ÿ2566?BC), builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafra's father.[26] He supports this by suggesting that Khafra's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.[20]\\r\\nColin Reader, an English geologist who independently conducted a more recent survey of the enclosure, agrees that the various quarries on the site have been excavated around the Causeway. Because these quarries are known to have been used by Khufu, Reader concludes that the Causeway (and the temples on either end thereof) must predate Khufu, thereby casting doubt on the conventional Egyptian chronology.[20]\\r\\nFrank Domingo, a forensic scientist in the New York City Police Department and an expert forensic anthropologist,[27] used detailed measurements of the Sphinx, forensic drawings and computer imaging to conclude that the face depicted on the Sphinx is not the same face as is depicted on a statue attributed to Khafra.[28]\\r\\nIn 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Fran?ais d'Archologie Orientale in Cairo announced that he had uncovered new evidence that the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known Pharaoh Djedefre (2528ÿ2520?BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu.[29] Dobrev suggests that Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, that the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time.[26]\\r\\nThe Orion correlation theory, as expounded by popular authors Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval,[30] is based on the proposed exact correlation of the three pyramids at Giza with the three stars ?Ori, ?Ori and Ѵ?Ori, the stars forming Orion's Belt, in the relative positions occupied by these stars in 10500?BC. The authors argue that the geographic relationship of the Sphinx, the Giza pyramids and the Nile directly corresponds with Leo, Orion and the Milky Way respectively. Sometimes cited as an example of pseudoarchaeology, the theory is at variance with mainstream scholarship.[31][32][33]\\r\\nThe Sphinx water erosion hypothesis contends that the main type of weathering evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall,[34] and that it must therefore predate the time of the pharaoh Khafra. The hypothesis is championed primarily by Robert M. Schoch, a geologist and associate professor of natural science at the College of General Studies at Boston University, and John Anthony West, an author and alternative Egyptologist.\\r\\nColin Reader, a British geologist, studied the erosion effects and noticed that the effects are selectively at the western enclosure wall and not on the Sphinx itself. He proposed the rainfall water runoff hypothesis, which also recognizes climate change transitions in the area.[35][36]\\r\\nAuthor Robert K. G. Temple proposes that the Sphinx was originally a statue of the Jackal-Dog Anubis, the God of the Necropolis, and that its face was recarved in the likeness of a Middle Kingdom pharaoh, Amenemhet II. Temple bases his identification on the style of the eye make-up and the style of the pleats on the head-dress.[37]\\r\\nOver the years several authors have commented on what they perceive as \\"Negroid\\" characteristics in the face of the Sphinx.[38] This issue has become part of the Ancient Egyptian race controversy, with respect to the ancient population as a whole.[39] The face of the Sphinx has been damaged over the millennia.\\r\\nAt some unknown time the Giza Necropolis was abandoned, and the Sphinx was eventually buried up to its shoulders in sand. The first documented attempt at an excavation dates to c. 1400?BC, when the young Thutmose?IV (1401ÿ1391 or 1397ÿ1388?BC) gathered a team and, after much effort, managed to dig out the front paws, between which he placed a granite slab, known as the Dream Stele, inscribed with the following (an extract):\\r\\n... the royal son, Thothmos, being arrived, while walking at midday and seating himself under the shadow of this mighty god, was overcome by slumber and slept at the very moment when Ra is at the summit [of heaven]. He found that the Majesty of this august god spoke to him with his own mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: Look upon me, contemplate me, O my son Thothmos; I am thy father, Harmakhis-Khopri-Ra-Tum; I bestow upon thee the sovereignty over my domain, the supremacy over the living?... Behold my actual condition that thou mayest protect all my perfect limbs. The sand of the desert whereon I am laid has covered me. Save me, causing all that is in my heart to be executed.[40]\\r\\nLater, Ramesses II the Great (1279ÿ1213?BC) may have undertaken a second excavation.\\r\\nMark Lehner, an Egyptologist who has excavated and mapped the Giza plateau, originally asserted that there had been a far earlier renovation during the Old Kingdom (c.?2686ÿ2184?BC),[41] although he has subsequently recanted this \\"heretical\\" viewpoint.[42]\\r\\nIn AD 1817 the first modern archaeological dig, supervised by the Italian Giovanni Battista Caviglia, uncovered the Sphinx's chest completely.\\r\\nOne of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was Eugne Grbaut, a French Director of the Antiquities Service[43] \\"In the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible. Flights of steps were unearthed, and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of Th?tmosis IV was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx.\\"[44]\\r\\nThe entire Sphinx was finally excavated in 1925 to 1936, in digs led by mile Baraize.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1931 engineers of the Egyptian government repaired the head of the Sphinx. Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck.[45]\\r\\nThe one-metre-wide nose on the face is missing. Examination of the Sphinx's face shows that long rods or chisels were hammered into the nose, one down from the bridge and one beneath the nostril, then used to pry the nose off towards the south.[47]\\r\\nThe Arab historian al-Maqrؐzؐ, writing in the 15th century, attributes the loss of the nose to iconoclasm by Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahra Sufi Muslim from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'adain AD?1378, upon finding the local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest. Enraged, he destroyed the nose, and was later hanged for vandalism.[48] Al-Maqrؐzؐ describes the Sphinx as the \\"talisman of the Nile\\" on which the locals believed the flood cycle depended.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere is also a story that the nose was broken off by a cannonball fired by Napoleon's soldiers. Other variants indict British troops, the Mamluks, and others. Sketches of the Sphinx by the Dane Frederic Louis Norden, made in 1738 and published in 1757, show the Sphinx missing its nose.[49] This predates Napoleon's birth in 1769.\\r\\nIn addition to the lost nose, a ceremonial pharaonic beard is thought to have been attached, although this may have been added in later periods after the original construction. Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev has suggested that had the beard been an original part of the Sphinx, it would have damaged the chin of the statue upon falling.[26] The lack of visible damage supports his theory that the beard was a later addition.\\r\\nResidues of red pigment are visible on areas of the Sphinx's face. Traces of yellow and blue pigment have been found elsewhere on the Sphinx, leading Mark Lehner to suggest that the monument \\"was once decked out in gaudy comic book colors\\".[50]\\r\\nColin Reader has proposed that the Sphinx was probably the focus of solar worship in the Early Dynastic Period, before the Giza Plateau became a necropolis in the Old Kingdom (c. 2686ÿ2134 BC).[51] He ties this in with his conclusions that the Sphinx, the Sphinx temple, the Causeway and the Khafra mortuary temple are all part of a complex which predates Dynasty?IV (c. 2613ÿ2494?BC). The lion has long been a symbol associated with the sun in ancient Near Eastern civilizations. Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies date as far back as the Early Dynastic Period.\\r\\nIn the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the god Hor-em-akhet (Hellenized: Harmachis) or \\"Horus-at-the-Horizon\\", which represented the pharaoh in his role as the Shesep-ankh (English: Living Image) of the god Atum. Pharaoh Amenhotep?II (1427ÿ1401 or 1397?BC) built a temple to the north east of the Sphinx nearly 1000 years after its construction, and dedicated it to the cult of Hor-em-akhet.\\r\\nIn the last 700 years, there has been a proliferation of travellers and reports from Lower Egypt, unlike Upper Egypt, which was seldom reported from prior to the mid-18th century. Alexandria, Rosetta, Damietta, Cairo and the Giza Pyramids are described repeatedly, but not necessarily comprehensively. Many accounts were published and widely read. These include those of George Sandys, Andr Thvet, Athanasius Kircher, Balthasar de Monconys, Jean de Thvenot, John Greaves, Johann Michael Vansleb, Beno?t de Maillet, Cornelis de Bruijn, Paul Lucas, Richard Pococke, Frederic Louis Norden and others. But there is an even larger set of more anonymous people who wrote obscure and little-read works, sometimes only unpublished manuscripts in libraries or private collections, including Henry Castela, Hans Ludwig von Lichtenstein, Michael Heberer von Bretten, Wilhelm von Boldensele, Pierre Belon du Mans, Vincent Stochove, Christophe Harant, Gilles Fermanel, Robert Fauvel, Jean Palerne Foresien, Willian Lithgow, Joos van Ghistele, etc.\\r\\nOver the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx. The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A typical description of the Sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the 19th and 20th century was made by John Lawson Stoddard:\\r\\nIt is the antiquity of the Sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it, for in itself it has no charms. The desert's waves have risen to its breast, as if to wrap the monster in a winding-sheet of gold. The face and head have been mutilated by Moslem fanatics. The mouth, the beauty of whose lips was once admired, is now expressionless. Yet grand in its loneliness, ÿ veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages, ÿ the relic of Egyptian antiquity stands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert?ÿ symbol of eternity. Here it disputes with Time the empire of the past; forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we, like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.[52]\\r\\nFrom the 16th century far into the 19th century, observers repeatedly noted that the Sphinx has the face, neck and breast of a woman. Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), George Sandys (1615), Johann Michael Vansleb (1677), Beno?t de Maillet (1735) and Elliot Warburton (1844).\\r\\nMost early Western images were book illustrations in print form, elaborated by a professional engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost. Seven years after visiting Giza, Andr Thvet (Cosmographie de Levant, 1556) described the Sphinx as \\"the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter\\". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue, reflecting his ability to conceptualize (Turris Babel, 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Thevet is that the hair suggests the flaring lappets of the headdress. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a harlot; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, while Fran?ois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz's Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar.\\r\\nRichard Pococke's Sphinx was an adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous. The print versions of Norden's careful drawings for his Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie, 1755 are the first to clearly show that the nose was missing. However, from the time of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt onwards, a number of accurate images were widely available in Europe, and copied by others.\\r\\nMystery of the Sphinx, narrated by Charlton Heston, a documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West, was shown as an NBC Special on 10 November 1993 (winning an Emmy award for Best Research[citation needed]) A 95-minute DVD, Mystery of the Sphinx: Expanded Edition, was released in 2007. Age of the Sphinx, a BBC Two Timewatch documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West and critical to both sides of the argument, was shown on 27 November 1994. In 2008, the film 10,000?BC showed a supposed original Sphinx with a lion's head.

Up until 2009, when the first pride of white lions was reintroduced to the wild, it was widely believed that the white lion could not survive in the wild. It is for this reason that a large part of the population of white lions now reside in zoos.[1]\\r\\nWhite lions in the area of Timbavati is the same subspecies as the tawny Southeast African lion (Panthera leo krugeri) found in some wildlife reserves in South Africa, and in zoological parks around the world. They were thought to have been indigenous to the Timbavati region of South Africa for centuries, although the earliest recorded sighting in this region was in 1938. Regarded as divine by locals, white lions first came to public attention in the 1970s, in Chris McBride's book The White Lions of Timbavati.[1]\\r\\nWhite lions of Mazanie are not albinos. Their white color is caused by a recessive trait derived from a less-severe mutation in the same gene that causes albinism, distinct from the gene responsible for white tigers. They vary from blonde to near-white. This coloration does not appear to disadvantage their survival. The white lions of the Global White Lion Protection Trust (GWLPT) have been reintroduced into their natural habitat and have been hunting and breeding successfully without human intervention for a significant amount of time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA recessive gene gives white lions their unusual colors. A similar gene also produces white tigers. White lions can therefore be selectively bred for zoos, animal shows and wildlife parks. Such breeding involves inbreeding and can result in inbreeding depression (genetic defects, reduced fertility, and physical defects), although this has not yet been found to cause hind-limb paralysis or serious heart defects, which would indicate a severe level of inbreeding. Some are concerned about white lions mating with lions of other alleles, due to possible extinction of the white lion allele. However, this is not valid as the offspring will inherit the recessive white gene and therefore make it possible to produce white offspring in a later generation, thus making the allele more widespread. Some critics maintain that white lions should not be introduced into the wild because of the inbreeding that has taken place in zoos and breeding camps. However, ethical reintroduction programs such as The Global White Lion Protection Trust have ensured through the use of scientific methodologies that the lions in their program are not inbred.[citation needed]\\r\\nLory Park Zoo is currently in possession of two adult white lions (Daniel and Heidi), who have produced eight cubs. A litter of three cubs was born in 2012 and all three were hand-reared. A second litter of five cubs was born in 2013; three were removed for their own well-being while the remaining two (a male, Gabriel, and a female, Gazelle) were left with the parents. Both cubs are still with the parents and have not been handled by humans. A male cub was traded for other animals in August 2013 and now lives at the Hodonin Zoo in the Czech Republic.[5]\\r\\nIn 1979, three litters containing white lions were recorded in Kruger National Park. In March, a female lion with three white cubs was observed near Tshokwane. In September, three white cubs (from two different lionesses) were seen. Another litter of white female cubs was captured from Kruger National Park and treated for sarcoptic mange. A white lion was observed in the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve in Zululand.\\r\\nIn 2004, four white lions arrived at West Midland Safari Park, the only white lions in the United Kingdom. Roland (or Rowland), the male, and three lionesses (Marin, Natasha, and JoAnn; spellings undocumented) settled into the Kingdom of the White Lion exhibit at the park very well. In 2008 one lioness had four cubs in the space of nine hours, doubling the total to eight in England. The pride at the Park in Worcestershire is the only pride of white lion in the UK.\\r\\nNewspapers and bloggers reported that the four cubs born at West Midlands Safari Park, in 2008 (names: Caspar, Kiara, Lara and Toto; spellings undocumented) had been sold to perform in a Japanese circus.[6][7][8][9] It is alleged that the lions were given to British businessman Jim Clubb, who runs Amazing Animals, which also goes by the name Heythrop Zoological Gardens, in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. The animal rights organization Lion Aid, Ltd., quoted Mr. Clubb as saying, first, \\"No comment,\\" then, \\"I've no idea if the West Midland Safari Park knew they were going to the circus, that's a matter for them.\\"[7] Bob Lawrence, the Head Keeper of West Midland Safari Park, who appears often in the YouTube videos raising the cubs, told the Worcester News, a local newspaper, that he \\"would never have supplied the four white lion cubs if he had known they would have ended up performing in a Japanese circus.\\"[9]\\r\\nIn May 2007 four white lion cubs were born at Jurques Zoo in France. The cubs consisted of one male and three females. Each cub weighed approximately 1.5?kg (3.3 pounds) at birth, and all four were in good health. However, they needed to be hand fed because their mother was not taking proper care of them.\\r\\nA private zoo in Abony, Hungary recently acquired two white lion cubs, one male and one female lion.\\r\\nBelgrade Zoo in Serbia has 12 white lions. In 2010 four were born by two female lions, each weighing about 1.5?kg (3.3 pounds).[10] Four additional white lions were born in April 2011.[11] One more cub was born in October 2013,[12] but died soon after.[13]\\r\\nPafos Zoo, an Animal and Bird wildlife park in Cyprus, received two seven-month-old white lion cubs in 2011.\\r\\nIn December 2013, four white lion cubs were born at Tbilisi Zoo in Georgia. Cubs needed to be hand fed because their mother wasn't taking proper care of them. Another three cubs were born in May 2014.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2012, the Karachi Zoo, Pakistan, purchased a juvenile male and juvenile female white lion. They have had 2 cubs.\\r\\nThe first White Lions introduced into Malaysia was in March 2013 when the Safari Park in Bukit Gambang Resort City (Pahang) opened its door to the public. With 2 males and 3 females, the first White Lion was born in May 2014 and was named King.[14]\\r\\nA couple of white lions named Zola and Zuri reside in the Sunway Lagoon's Wildlife Park since April 2015.[15]\\r\\nSingapore Night Safari, A subsidiary of Wildlife Reserves Singapore, recently acquired two white lions, a male and a female.\\r\\nIn 2012, Toronto Zoo in Canada received three white lions to their African zone[16] and replacing the single white lioness the zoo had since 1996.[17] In September 2015, four white lion cubs were born at the zoo.[18]\\r\\nMexican zoo Reino Animal, located in Otumba, State of Mexico, also has a couple of white lions which can be seen at the \\"Safari Leones\\" (Lions' Safari).[19]\\r\\nA lion protection and preservation sanctuary in New Zealand possess six male white lions and four female white lions.\\r\\nWhite Lions are not albinos but are leucistic. They have pigment visible in the eyes (which may be the normal hazel or golden color, blue-gray, or green-gray), paw pads and lips. Blue-eyed white lions exist and may be selectively bred. The leucistic trait is due to a recessive mutation in the gene for Tyrosinase (TYR), an enzyme responsible for the production of melanins.[20] More severe mutations in the same gene have been found to cause albinism in many species, while another less severe mutation in the same gene is responsible for the Chinchilla coloring trait seen in several mammals. Reduced pigment production decreases the deposition of pigment along the hair shaft, restricting it to the tips. The less pigment there is along the hair shaft, the paler the lion. As a result, \\"white\\" lions range from blonde to near-white. The males have pale manes and tail tips instead of the usual dark tawny or black.\\r\\nThe Latin name of Panthera leo krugeri is not limited to white lions. It applies to all Southeast African lions, the prides of which are mostly located in Kruger National Park and nearby game reserves.[21]\\r\\nFrom the 1970s onwards, prized for their rarity, the white lions and many 'normal' coloured (tawny) lions carrying the white lion gene were removed from the wild and put into captive breeding and hunting programs and sent to zoos and circuses around the globe. No adult white lion had been seen in their natural habitat since 1994. The Global White Lion Protection Trust (WLT) therefore initiated a world-first re-establishment of white lions within their natural habitat in 2004, based on successful reintroduction techniques. The wild born offspring of rehabilitated white lions were integrated with resident wild tawny lions, and released through a soft release process. Three prides of white lions of high genetic integrity integrated with tawny lions have been successfully established, and are hunting self-sufficiently in their natural habitat, at a predation rate comparable to the wild tawny lions in the same habitat;.[22][23] The genetic marker determining the white colouration was identified in a collaborative study with 5 other countries in October 2013,[20] and is being used to ensure genetic integrity and ultimately to determine the frequency of occurrence of the gene in the wild population.\\r\\nThe primary aim of the Global White Lion Protection Trust (WLT) is to harness the cultural importance of white lions to local indigenous communities,[24] to help protect the Kruger to Canyon (K2C) Biosphere and the greater lion population in this region. This approach is based on the international precedent of the Kermode Bear (Ursus americanus kermodei) in British Columbia (Western Canada), whereby this rare, white variant of the American black bear (Ursus americanus) has been declared a critically endangered subspecies due to its conservation and cultural value, such that the Kermode Bear is being used as a flagship species for protecting a 4000 000 ha wilderness area.[25] As with the Kermode Bear, by protecting the white lions, their entire population within their endemic area would be protected.\\r\\nSubsequently, white cubs were born in the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and in the Nwanetsi Area of Kruger National Park in 2014 and 2015, confirming that white lions are a natural occurrence and the recessive gene is still present in the wild population.\\r\\nIn light of the recent decision by South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) at CITES 2016, to continue to allow the hunting of captive bred lions (\\"canned hunting\\"), and the trade in lion bones from captive bred lions, the Global White Lion Protection Trust (WLT) asserts that the survival of lions in the Greater Kruger Park Region is likely to come under threat, and the white lion is the ideal capstone animal to help better protect all lions in the Greater Kruger Park Region.\\r\\nAs the proposed policy stands for the management of lions in South Africa,[26] the WLT asserts that the legalization of the lion bone trade will increase the supply and therefore demand of wild lion trophies and especially lion bones, increasing poaching and illegal hunting and threatening the future of wild lion populations in South Africa.[27]","input":"Where are white lions found in the world?"},{"output":"18:07:41 UTC","context":"\\r\\nApollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the Apollo space program and the third intended to land on the Moon. The craft was launched on April 11, 1970, at 14:13 EST (19:13 UTC) from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded two days later, crippling the Service Module (SM) upon which the Command Module (CM) had depended. Despite great hardship caused by limited power, loss of cabin heat, shortage of potable water, and the critical need to make makeshift repairs to the carbon dioxide removal system, the crew returned safely to Earth on April 17, 1970, six days after launch.\\r\\nThe flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers (137 nautical miles) above the lunar surface, and 400,171?km (248,655?mi) from Earth, a spaceflight record marking the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth. The mission was commanded by James A. Lovell with John L. \\"Jack\\" Swigert as Command Module Pilot and Fred W. Haise as Lunar Module Pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for the original CM pilot Ken Mattingly, who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to German measles.\\r\\nThe story of the Apollo 13 mission has been dramatized multiple times, most notably in the 1995 film Apollo 13.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the standard crew rotation in place during the Apollo program, the prime crew for Apollo 13 would have been the backup crew for Apollo 10 with Mercury and Gemini veteran L.

That crew was composed of\\r\\nDeke Slayton, NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, never intended to rotate Cooper and Eisele to another mission, as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard Apollo 7 and an extra-marital affair). He assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight-qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made.[2] Slayton felt Cooper had no more than a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command, if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he did not. Despite Eisele's issues with management, Slayton always intended to assign him to a future Apollo Applications Program mission rather than a lunar mission, but this program was eventually cut down to only the Skylab component.\\r\\nThus, the original assignment Slayton submitted to his superiors for this flight was:\\r\\nFor the first time ever, Slayton's recommendation was rejected by management, who felt that Shepard needed more time to train properly for a lunar flight, as he had only recently benefited from experimental surgery to correct an inner ear disorder which had kept him grounded since his first Mercury flight in 1961. Thus, Lovell's crew, backup for the historic Apollo 11 mission and therefore slated for Apollo 14, was swapped with Shepard's crew[2] and the original crew selection for the mission became:\\r\\nPrime crew:\\r\\nBackup crew:\\r\\nKen Mattingly was originally intended as the Command Module Pilot. Seven days before launch, the Backup Lunar Module Pilot, Charlie Duke, contracted rubella from one of his children. This exposed both the prime and backup crews, who trained together. Mattingly was found to be the only one of the other five who had not had rubella as a child and thus was not immune. Three days before launch, at the insistence of the Flight Surgeon, Swigert was moved to the prime crew.[4]\\r\\nMattingly never contracted rubella and was assigned after the mission as Command Module Pilot to Young's crew, which later flew Apollo 16, the fifth mission to land on the Moon.\\r\\nThe astronauts' mission insignia was sculpted as a medallion titled Steeds of Apollo by Lumen Martin Winter and was struck by the Franklin Mint.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Apollo 13 mission was to explore the Fra Mauro formation, or Fra Mauro highlands, named after the 80-kilometer (50?mi) diameter Fra Mauro crater located within it. It is a widespread, hilly selenological area thought to be composed of ejecta from the impact that formed Mare Imbrium.\\r\\nThe next Apollo mission, Apollo 14, eventually made a successful flight to Fra Mauro.\\r\\nApril 14, 1970 UTC (April 13, 21:07:53 CST)\\r\\nApril 15, 1970, 00:21:00 UTC; 137?nmi (253.7?km)[9]\\r\\nApril 17, 1970, 18:07:41 UTC (142:54:47 Ground Elapsed Time). Crew was on board the USS Iwo Jima 45 minutes later.\\r\\nThe mission was launched at the planned time, 02:13:00 PM EST (19:13:00 UTC) on April 11. An anomaly occurred when the second-stage, center (inboard) engine shut down about two minutes early. The four outboard engines and the third-stage engine burned longer to compensate, and the vehicle achieved very close to the planned circular 100 nautical miles (190?km) parking orbit, followed by a normal translunar injection about two hours later.[6][10] The engine shutdown was determined to be caused by severe pogo oscillations measured at a strength of 68 g and a frequency of 16 hertz, flexing the thrust frame by 3 inches (76?mm). The vehicle's guidance system shut the engine down in response to sensed thrust chamber pressure fluctuations. Pogo oscillations had been seen on previous Titan rockets, and also on the Saturn V during Apollo 6,[11] but on Apollo 13, they were amplified by an unexpected interaction with turbopump cavitation.[12] Later missions implemented anti-pogo modifications that had been under development. These included addition of a helium-gas reservoir to the center engine liquid oxygen line to damp pressure oscillations, an automatic cutoff as a backup, and simplification of the propellant valves of all five second-stage engines.\\r\\nThe crew performed the separation and transposition maneuver to dock the Command Module Odyssey to the Lunar Module (LM) Aquarius, and pulled away from the spent third stage, which ground controllers then sent on a course to impact the Moon in range of a seismometer placed on the surface by Apollo 12. They then settled in for the three-day trip to Fra Mauro.\\r\\nApproaching 56 hours into the mission, Apollo 13 was approximately 205,000 miles (330,000?km) from Earth en route to the Moon.[13][14] Approximately six and a half minutes after the end of a live TV broadcast from the spacecraft, Haise was in the process of closing out the LM, while Lovell was stowing the TV camera, and Houston flight controllers asked Swigert to turn on the hydrogen and oxygen tank stirring fans in the Service Module, which were designed to destratify the cryogenic contents and increase the accuracy of their quantity readings. Two minutes later, the astronauts heard a \\"pretty large bang,\\" accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and the firing of the attitude control thrusters.[7] The crew initially thought that a meteoroid might have struck the Lunar Module. Communications and telemetry to Earth were lost for 1.8 seconds, until the system automatically corrected by switching the high-gain S-band antenna, used for translunar communications, from narrow-beam to wide-beam mode.[15]\\r\\nImmediately after the bang Swigert reported a \\"problem\\", which Lovell repeated and clarified as a \\"main B bus undervolt\\", a temporary loss of operating voltage on the second of the spacecraft's main electrical circuits. Oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero. About three minutes later, the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed. Lovell reported seeing out the window that the craft was venting \\"a gas of some sort\\" into space. The number 1 oxygen tank quantity gradually reduced to zero over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.[16]\\r\\nBecause the fuel cells generated the Command/Service Module's electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water, when oxygen tank 1 ran dry, the remaining fuel cell finally shut down, leaving the craft on the Command Module's limited-duration battery power and water. The crew was forced to shut down the CM completely to save this for re-entry, and to power up the LM to use as a \\"lifeboat.\\"[17] This situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation, but had not been considered a likely scenario.[18] Without the LM, the accident would certainly have been fatal.[19]\\r\\nThe damage to the Service Module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible, so Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz ordered an abort of the mission. The existing abort plans, first drawn up in 1966, were evaluated; the quickest was a Direct Abort trajectory, which required using the Service Module Propulsion System (SPS) engine to achieve a 6,079-foot-per-second (1,853?m/s) delta-v.[5]p.?III-14 Although a successful SPS firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time (GET) would land the crew one day earlier (at 118 hours GET, or 58 hours later), the large delta-v was possible only if the LM were jettisoned first,[5]p.?II-1 and since crew survival depended on the LM's presence during the coast back to Earth, that option was \\"out of the question.\\"[5]p.?III-17 An alternative would have been to burn the SPS fuel to depletion, then jettison the Service Module and make a second burn with the LM Descent Propulsion System (DPS) engine. It was desired to keep the Service Module attached for as long as possible because of the thermal protection it afforded the Command Module's heat shield. Apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar sphere of gravitational influence (at 61 hours GET), which was the break-even point between direct and circumlunar aborts, and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn.[5]p. B-5 There also was concern about \\"the structural integrity of the Service Module,\\"[5]p.?III?23 so mission planners were instructed that the SPS engine would not be used \\"except as a last-ditch effort.\\"[5]p.?III-14\\r\\nFor these reasons, Kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option, using the Moon's gravity to return the ship to Earth. Apollo 13 had left its initial free-return trajectory earlier in the mission, as required for the lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, the first order of business was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the DPS. The descent engine was used again two hours after pericynthion, the closest approach to the Moon (\\"PC+2 burn\\"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the Service Module, returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort,[5]p.?III-20 but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used. The 4-minute, 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed.\\r\\nConsiderable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew, flight controllers, and support personnel for the safe return. The developing drama was shown on television.[20] Because electrical power was severely limited, no more live TV broadcasts were made; TV commentators used models and animated footage as illustrations. Low power levels made even voice communications difficult.\\r\\nThe Lunar Module consumables were intended to sustain two people for a day and a half, not three people for four days. Oxygen was the least critical consumable because the LM carried enough to repressurize the LM after each surface EVA. Unlike the Command/Service Module (CSM), which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct, the LM was powered by silver-zinc batteries, so electrical power and water (used for equipment cooling as well as drinking) were critical consumables. To keep the LM life-support and communication systems operational until re-entry, the LM was powered down to the lowest levels possible. In particular, the LM's Abort Guidance System was used for most of the coast back to Earth instead of the primary guidance system, as it used less power and water.[5]pp.?III?17,33,40\\r\\nAvailability of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) for removing carbon dioxide presented a serious problem. The LM's internal stock of LiOH canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return, and the remainder was stored in the descent stage, out of reach. The CM had an adequate supply of canisters, but these were incompatible with the LM. Engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped CM canisters to the LM's cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose. NASA engineers referred to the improvised device as \\"the mailbox\\".[21][22]\\r\\nAnother problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down Command Module, something never intended to be done in-flight. Flight controller John Aaron, with the support of grounded astronaut Mattingly and many engineers and designers, had to invent a new procedure to do this with the ship's limited power supply and time factor.[23] This was further complicated by the fact that the reduced power levels in the LM caused internal temperatures to drop to as low as 4?C (39?F). The unpowered CM got so cold that water began to condense on solid surfaces, causing concern that this might short out electrical systems when it was reactivated. This turned out not to be a problem, partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the Apollo 1 fire.[24]\\r\\nThe last problem to be solved was how to separate the Lunar Module a safe distance away from the Command Module just before re-entry. The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's reaction control system (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist Bernard Etkin, was formed to solve the problem within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using slide rules. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.[25]\\r\\nAs Apollo 13 neared Earth, the crew first jettisoned the Service Module, using the LM's reaction control system to pull themselves a safe distance from it, instead of the normal procedure which used automatic firing of the SM's RCS. They photographed it for later analysis of the accident's cause. It was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the entire Sector 4 panel had been blown off. According to the analysts, these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment.\\r\\nFinally, the crew jettisoned the Lunar Module Aquarius using the above procedure worked out at the University of Toronto, leaving the Command Module Odyssey to begin its lone re-entry through the atmosphere. The re-entry on a lunar mission normally was accompanied by about four minutes of typical communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the Command Module. The blackout in Apollo 13's reentry lasted six minutes, which was 87 seconds longer than had been expected.[26] The possibility of heat-shield damage from the O\\r\\n2 tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period.\\r\\nOdyssey regained radio contact and splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean, 213824S 1652142W? / ?21.64000S 165.36167W? / -21.64000; -165.36167? (Apollo 13 splashdown), southeast of American Samoa and 6.5?km (3.5?nmi) from the recovery ship, USS Iwo Jima. The crew was in good condition except for Haise, who was suffering from a serious urinary tract infection because of insufficient water intake. To avoid altering the trajectory of the spacecraft, the crew had been instructed to temporarily stop urine dumps. A misunderstanding prompted the crew to store all urine for the rest of the flight.[27]\\r\\nThe Lunar Module and Service Module reentered the atmosphere over the South Pacific between the islands of Fiji and New Zealand.[28]\\r\\nThe crew of Apollo 13 on board the USS Iwo Jima following splashdown\\r\\nThe Apollo 13 Lunar Module Aquarius is jettisoned above the Earth after serving as a lifeboat for four days.

Cortright on April 17, 1970, (date of spacecraft splashdown) advising him of his appointment as chairman of an Apollo 13 Review Board to investigate the cause of the accident.\\r\\nThe second memorandum to Cortright from Paine and Low on April 21 established the board as follows:\\r\\nThe board exhaustively investigated and analyzed the history of the manufacture and testing of the oxygen tank, and its installation and testing in the spacecraft up to the Apollo 13 launch, as documented in detailed records and logs. They visited and consulted with engineers at the contractor's sites and the Kennedy Space Center. Once a theory of the cause was developed, elements of it were tested, including on a test rig simulation in a vacuum chamber, with a damaged tank installed in the fuel cell bay. This test confirmed the theory when a similar explosion was created, which blew off the outer panel exactly as happened in the flight. Cortright sent the final Report of Apollo 13 Review Board to Thomas Paine on June 15, 1970.[29]\\r\\nThe failure started in the Service Module's number 2 oxygen tank.[30] Damaged Teflon insulation on the wires to the stirring fan inside oxygen tank 2 allowed the wires to short-circuit and ignite this insulation. The resulting fire rapidly increased pressure beyond its 1,000-pound-per-square-inch (6.9?MPa) limit and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (Sector 4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. It is also possible some combustion occurred of the Mylar/Kapton thermal insulation material used to line the oxygen shelf compartment in this bay.[16]\\r\\nThe resulting pressure inside the compartment popped the bolts attaching the 13-foot (4.0?m) Sector 4 outer aluminum skin panel, which as it blew off probably caused minor damage to the nearby S-band antenna.[15]\\r\\nMechanical shock forced the oxygen valves closed on the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells, leaving them operating for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines. The shock also either partially ruptured a line from the number 1 oxygen tank, or caused its check or relief valve to leak, causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.[16]\\r\\nThe board determined the oxygen tank failure was caused by an unlikely chain of events. Tanks storing cryogens, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, require either venting, extremely good insulation, or both, in order to avoid excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks' contents. The Service Module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain supercritical hydrogen and oxygen for years. Each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen, which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water. The construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible.\\r\\nThe tank contained several components relevant to the accident:\\r\\nThe heater and protection thermostats were originally designed for the Command Module's 28-volt DC bus. The specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply, in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly. Beechcraft, the tank subcontractor, did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage.\\r\\nThe oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the Apollo 10 Service Module, but was removed to fix a potential electromagnetic interference problem. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped about 2 inches (5?cm) because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The tank appeared to be undamaged, but a loosely fitting filling tube was apparently damaged, and photographs suggested that the close-out cap on the top of the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf. The report of the Apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be \\"rather low.\\"[16] After the tank was filled for ground testing, it could not be emptied through the normal drain line. To avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank, the heater was connected to 65-volt ground power to boil off the oxygen. Lovell signed off on this procedure. It should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of 27?C (81?F). When the thermostat opened, the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered. The board confirmed by testing that the thermostats welded themselves closed under the higher voltage. This raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated 540?C (1,000?F). A chart recorder on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off, as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly, but no one noticed it at the time. Because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the 27?C (81?F) thermostat opening temperature, the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank.[31][32] The gas boiled off in hours rather than days.\\r\\nThe sustained high temperatures melted the Teflon insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed. When the tank was refilled with oxygen, it became a bomb waiting to go off. During the \\"cryo stir\\" procedure, fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted, producing sparks and igniting the Teflon. This in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it.\\r\\nIn June 1970, the Cortright Report[16] provided an in-depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five-chapter report with eight appendices. It included a copy of established NASA procedures for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank, to include:\\r\\nThis procedure was designed to prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued. The Mission Operations Report Apollo 13 recounts how the master caution and warning alarm had been turned off for a previous low-pressure reading on hydrogen tank 2, and so it did not trigger to call attention to the high oxygen pressure reading.[33]\\r\\nOxygen tank 2 was not the only pressure vessel that failed during this mission. Prior to the accident, the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the Lunar Module forward by three hours. This was done to get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium (SHe) tank in the LM descent stage, which had been suspect since before launch. After the abort decision, the helium pressure continued to rise and Mission Control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture. The helium tank burst disc ruptured at 108:54, after the lunar flyby. The expulsion reversed the direction of the passive thermal control (PTC) roll (nicknamed the \\"barbecue roll\\").[34]\\r\\nWhile the investigation board did recreate the oxygen tank failure, it did not report on any experiments that would show how effective the Cryogenic Malfunctions Procedures were to prevent the system failure by de-energizing the electrical heater and fan circuits.\\r\\nThe oxygen tank was redesigned, with the thermostats upgraded to handle the proper voltage. The heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure. The stirring fans, with their unsealed motors, were removed, which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate. This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.[35]\\r\\nAll electrical wiring in the power system bay was sheathed in stainless steel, and the oxygen quantity probes were changed from aluminum to stainless steel. The fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the Teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen. The spacecraft and Mission Control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies.[35]\\r\\nBecause Apollo 13 followed the free-return trajectory, its altitude over the lunar far side was approximately 100?km (60?mi) greater than the orbital altitude on the remaining Apollo lunar missions. The Moon was almost at apogee during the mission (as it also was during the flights of Apollo 10 and Apollo 15), which also increased the distance from the Earth. The combination of the two effects ensures that Apollo 13 holds the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft, reaching a distance of 400,171 kilometers (248,655?mi) from Earth on 7:21?pm EST, April 14, 1970.[36]\\r\\nThe A7L spacesuit intended to be worn on the lunar surface by Lovell would have been the first to feature red bands on the arms, legs, lunar EVA helmet assembly, and the life-support backpack. This came about because Mission Control personnel watching the video feeds of Apollos 11 and 12 had trouble distinguishing the astronauts while both had their helmet sunshades down. The red bands were used for the remaining Apollo flights, the Space Shuttle program, and in the International Space Station.\\r\\nThe Apollo 13 mission was called \\"a successful failure\\" by Lovell,[37] because of the successful safe return of the astronauts, but the failed lunar landing. Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz and Flight controller Sy Liebergot, the first one to see the telemetry of the initial oxygen tank failure, both describe it decades later as \\"NASA's finest hour.\\"[38][39]\\r\\nPresident Nixon awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the crew and the Apollo 13 Mission Operations Team for their actions during the mission.[40]\\r\\nThe Cold Cathode Gauge Experiment (CCGE) which was part of the ALSEP on Apollo 13 was never flown again. It was a version of the Cold Cathode Ion Gauge (CCIG) which featured on Apollo 12, Apollo 14, and Apollo 15. The CCGE was designed as a standalone version of the CCIG. On other missions, the CCIG was connected as part of the Suprathermal Ion Detector (SIDE). Because of the aborted landing, this experiment was never deployed. Other experiments included on Apollo 13's ALSEP included the Heat Flow Experiment (HFE), the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE), and the Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE).[41]\\r\\nThe original lunar plaque affixed to the front landing leg of Aquarius bore Mattinglys name, so a replacement plaque with Swigerts name was carried in the cabin, for Lovell to place over the other after he descended the ladder. He kept the plaque as a souvenir. In his book Lost Moon (later renamed Apollo 13), Lovell stated that, apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces, the only other memento he possesses is a letter from Charles Lindbergh.\\r\\nThe Apollo 13 crew patch featured three flying horses as Apollo's \\"chariot\\" across space. Given Lovell's Navy background, the logo also included the mottoes \\"Ex Luna, scientia\\" (\\"From the Moon, knowledge\\"), borrowed from the U.S. Naval Academy's motto, \\"Ex scientia tridens\\" (\\"From knowledge, sea power\\"). The mission number appeared in Roman numerals as Apollo XIII. The patch did not have to be modified after Mattingly's replacement since it is one of only two Apollo mission insigniathe other being Apollo 11not to include the names of the crew. It was designed by artist Lumen Martin Winter, who based it on a mural he had done for The St. Regis Hotel in New York City.[42][43] The mural was later purchased by actor Tom Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the movie Apollo 13, and now is on the wall of a restaurant near Chicago owned by Lovell's son.[44]\\r\\nDespite Apollo 13's failure to land on the Moon, several experiments were conducted successfully because they were initiated before or conducted independently of the oxygen tank explosion.[45]\\r\\nAs a joke following Apollo 13's successful splashdown, Grumman Aerospace Corporation pilot Sam Greenberg (who had helped with the strategy for re-routing power from the LM to the crippled CM) issued a tongue-in-cheek invoice for $400,540.05 to North American Rockwell, Pratt and Whitney, and Beech Aircraft,[46][47] prime and subcontractors for the CSM, for \\"towing\\" the crippled ship most of the way to the Moon and back. The figure was based on an estimated 400,001 miles (643,739?km) at $1.00 per mile, plus $4.00 for the first mile. An extra $536.05 was included for battery charging, oxygen, and an \\"additional guest in room\\" (Swigert). A 20% \\"commercial discount,\\" as well as a further 2% discount if North American were to pay in cash, reduced the total to $312,421.24.[48] North American declined payment, noting that it had ferried three previous Grumman LMs to the Moon (Apollo 10, Apollo 11 and Apollo 12) with no such reciprocal charges.\\r\\nThe Command Module shell was formerly at the Muse de l'Air et de l'Espace, in Paris. The interior components were removed during the investigation of the accident and reassembled into boilerplate BP-1102A, the water egress training module; and were subsequently on display at the Museum of Natural History and Science in Louisville, Kentucky, until 2000. The Command Module and the internal components were reassembled, and Odyssey is currently on display at the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas.\\r\\nThe Lunar Module burned up in Earth's atmosphere on April 17, 1970, having been targeted to enter over the Pacific Ocean to reduce the possibility of contamination from a SNAP 27 radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) on board. Intended to power the mission's ALSEP, the RTG survived re-entry (as designed) and landed in the Tonga Trench. While it will remain radioactive for several thousand years, it does not appear to be releasing any of its 3.9?kg of radioactive plutonium-238.[49]\\r\\nLovell's lunar space suit helmet, one of his gloves, and the plaque that had been intended to be left on the Moon are on exhibit at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.[50]\\r\\nThe Apollo 13 S-IVB with its Instrument Unit was guided to crash onto the lunar surface on April 14, providing a signal for the Apollo 12 Passive Seismic Experiment.\\r\\nA recording of the Apollo 13 S-IVB's impact on the lunar surface as detected by the Apollo 12 Passive Seismic Experiment\\r\\nCrater left by the S-IVB's impact\\r\\nLM armrest on display at the Apollo/Saturn V Center in Florida\\r\\nThe 1974 movie Houston, We've Got a Problem, while set around the Apollo 13 incident, is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives; only a couple of news clips and a narrator's solemn voice deal with the actual problems. \\"Houston... We've Got a Problem\\" was also the title of an episode of the BBC documentary series A Life At Stake, broadcast in March 1978. This was an accurate, if simplified, reconstruction of the events.[51]\\r\\nLovell was approached in 1991 by journalist Jeffrey Kluger about collaborating on a non-fiction account of the mission. The resultant book, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, was published in 1994. The next year, a film adaptation of the book, Apollo 13, was released, directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks as Lovell, Bill Paxton as Haise, Kevin Bacon as Swigert, Gary Sinise as Mattingly, Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. James Lovell, Eugene Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy, given that some dramatic license was taken. For example, the film changes the tense of Lovell's famous follow-up to Swigert's original words from, \\"Houston, we've had a problem\\", to \\"Houston, we have a problem\\".[52][53][54] The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Harris) and Best Supporting Actress (Quinlan).\\r\\nIn the 1998 miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, co-produced by Hanks and Howard, the mission is dramatized in the episode \\"We Interrupt This Program\\". Rather than showing the incident from the crew's perspective as in the Apollo 13 feature film, it is instead presented from an Earth-bound perspective of television reporters competing for coverage of the event.\\r\\nIn 2008, an interactive theatrical show titled Apollo 13: Mission Control[55] premiered at BATS Theatre in Wellington, New Zealand.[56] The production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline. The show also featured a 'guest' astronaut each night: a member of the public who suited up and amongst other duties, stirred the oxygen tanks and said the line \\"Houston, we've had a problem.\\" This 'replacement' astronaut was a nod to Jack Swigert, who replaced Ken Mattingly shortly before the launch in 1970. The production toured to other cities extensively in New Zealand and Australia in 2010ÿ2011. The production was scheduled to travel to the US in 2012.\\r\\nIn the DC's Legends of Tomorrow episode 'Moonshot,' the oxygen tank explosion is averted when Eobard Thawne disguises himself as Swigert, in order to retrieve a piece of the Spear of Destiny that was hidden in the pole section of the American flag planted on July 21, 1969. Thawne and Ray Palmer crash land the lander on the Moon's surface.[57]\\r\\nIn November 2011, a notebook containing a checklist Lovell used to calculate a trajectory to get the damaged spacecraft, Apollo 13, back to Earth, and handwritten calculations by Lovell, was auctioned off by Heritage Auctions for $388,375. NASA made an email inquiry asking Heritage if Lovell had clear title to the notebook, stating that NASA had \\"nothing to indicate\\" the agency had ever transferred ownership of the checklist to Lovell. In January 2012, Heritage stated that the sale had been placed on hold after NASA launched an investigation into whether it was the astronauts property to sell.[58]\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\\r\\nNASA reports\\r\\nMultimedia","input":"What time did apollo 13 land on earth?"},{"output":"June 4, 1946","context":"The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (79 P.L. 396, 60 Stat. 230) is a United States federal law that created the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to provide low-cost or free school lunch meals to qualified students through subsidies to schools.[1] The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children.[2] It was named after Richard Russell,?Jr., signed into law by President Harry S. Truman in 1946,[3] and entered the federal government into schools dietary programs on June 4, 1946.[4]\\r\\nThe majority of the support provided to schools participating in the program comes in the form of a cash reimbursement for each meal served. Schools are also entitled to receive commodity foods and additional commodities as they are available from surplus agricultural stocks. The National School Lunch Program serves 30.5?million children each day at a cost of $8.7?billion for fiscal year 2007. Most participants are also eligible for food during the summer through the Summer Food Service Program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSchool feeding in the United States underwent the same evolution as in Europe, beginning with sporadic food services undertaken by private societies and associations interested in child welfare and education. The Children's Aid Society of New York initiated a program in 1853, serving meals to students attending the vocational school.[5]\\r\\nIn 1894, the Starr Center Association in Philadelphia began serving penny lunches in one school, later expanding the service to another. Soon a lunch committee was established within the Home and School League, and lunches were extended to include nine schools in the city.[5]\\r\\nIn 1909, Dr. Cheesman A. Herrick, who was principal of the William Penn High School for Girls was credited with accomplishing the transfer of responsibilities for operation and support of the lunch program from charitable organizations to the Philadelphia School Board. He requested that a system be established to assure that the lunches served would be based upon sound principles of nutrition and required that the program be under the direction of a home economics graduate. The Board granted his request on an experimental basis and on the condition that the program would be self-supporting. The experiment proved successful, and the following year lunch services were extended to the Southern Manual Training School and later to three additional units.[5]\\r\\nIn the spring of 1912, the School Board established a Department of High School Lunches and directed that the food services be inaugurated in all the high schools of the city. During all this time the Home and School League had continued operating the feeding program in the nine elementary schools, and continued to do so until May 1915, when it reported to the Board that the need for a lunch system had been clearly demonstrated and that it could not be successfully operated by an organization outside the school system. As a result, the School Board placed the operation of both high school and elementary lunch programs under the supervision of the Department of High School Lunches and authorized the extension of the program to other elementary schools.[6]\\r\\nIn September 1908, the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston begun to supply hot lunches to high schools which were under the supervision of the Boston School Committee.A central kitchen system was used and lunches were transported to the participating schools.[7]\\r\\nIn January 1910, an experimental program for elementary schools took the form of a mid-morning lunch prepared by the class in Home Economics three days each week. On two days of each week sandwiches and milk were served. The children ate their meals at their desks, there being no lunchroom in the building. Before the end of the school year (1909ÿ10) five additional schools were benefiting from the program, and a total of 2,000 pupils were being served each day, according to a report submitted by Ellen H. Richards in the \\"Journal of Home Economics\\" for December 1910.[7]\\r\\nAs the scope of the meal supply expanded, local governments and school district boards could not provide the funds necessary to carry the increasing load. Supplementary contributions by charitable organizations and individuals did not suffice. Aid from Federal sources became inevitable. The earliest Federal aid came from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932 and 1933 when it granted loans to several towns in southwestern Missouri to cover the cost of labor employed in preparing and serving school lunches. Such Federal assistance was expanded to other areas in 1933 and 1934 under the operations of the Civil Works Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, reaching into 39 States and covering the employment of 7,442 women.[8]\\r\\nThe depression of the 1930s brought on widespread unemployment. Much of the production of the farm went begging for a market, surpluses of farm products continued to mount, prices of farm products declined to a point where farm income provided only a meager subsistence. Millions of school children were unable to pay for their school lunches, and with but limited family resources to provide meals at home, the danger of malnutrition among children became a national concern.[8]\\r\\nPublic Law 320 passed by the 74th Congress and approved August 24, 1936, made available to the Secretary of Agriculture an amount of money equal to 30 percent of the gross receipts from duties collected under the customs laws during each calendar year.[8]\\r\\nNeedy families and school lunch programs became constructive outlets for the commodities purchased by the USDA under the terms of such legislation. Many needy school children could not afford to pay for lunches and were sorely in need of supplementary foods from a nutritional standpoint. Thus they would be using foods at school which would not otherwise be purchased in the market place and farmers would be helped by obtaining an outlet for their products at a reasonable price. The purchase and distribution program was assigned in 1935 to the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation which had been established in 1933 as the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation to distribute surplus pork, dairy products, and wheat to the needy. These funds came from customs duties and were specifically designated to encourage agricultural surplus consumption via exports and domestic donations. In March 1937, there were 3,839 schools receiving commodities for lunch programs serving 342,031 children daily. Two years later, the number of schools participating had grown to 14,075 and the number of children had risen to 892,259.[8] From 1939 to 1942the number of schools participating increased by 78,841, and the number of pupils participating increased by 5,272,540.[8]\\r\\nIn July 1943, in an attempt to salvage the deterioration of school lunches, Congress passed Public Law 129 to amend the Agricultural Act of 1935. This law re-established school lunch programs using $60 million to cover the purchase of food, but not labor. The next year, Congress appropriated another $50 million and allowed child-care centers to participate.[8]\\r\\nSince the Act passed, Congress has modified several aspects of the policy. Congress amended the NSLP in 1962 to adjust fund distribution. They decided that the budget allocated to each state should be influenced by the states need for further assistance. Rather than just factoring in the number of participants, Congress took into account the state poverty level compared to the national poverty level. Then, in 1968, Congress improved the NSLP food options to accommodate students with special dietary needs.[9]\\r\\nMost recently, in 2012, First Lady Michelle Obama took on the issue of school lunches. Changes that she initiated primarily focused on more specific nutritional requirements. The changes include updated food group nutrition standards, such as vegetable subgroups, re-adjusted meat and grain serving sizes to reflect different school grade ranges, an implemented requirement for whole grains, and milk-fat restrictions. Lower calorie ranges and a 10-year progressive sodium reduction plan also started in 2012.[10]\\r\\nAny school is eligible to receive NSLP for its students; meals come from a number of different sources, they can come from on-site production, vended meal from a NSLP caterer or in most schools provided by the local school board centralized kitchen.\\r\\nThis is usually regulated by each state's Department of Education's nutrition services. Regardless of who provides the food (on-site production, catered-vended, or school board kitchen), the raw materials come from USDA as donated commodities; in the case of vended meals, the caterer must use and credit the school for the commodities received.\\r\\nDriven to increase the quality of food in the NSLP, the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) undertook an ambitious agenda to provide schools with a consistent supply of safe, low-fat ground beef. Beginning in 2002, AMS established a statistically based vendor certification and supply chain quality management program for the purchase of ground beef and pork for NSLP under the Technical Requirements Schedule (GB?2006, the current version). The program has enjoyed considerable success in reducing pathogen levels and controlling fat content in lean beef and pork that is provided to school children.\\r\\nUnder the program, Meat Grading and Certification (MGC) Branch agents enforce continuous auditing and in-plant monitoring as long as the contractor is in the program. Microbial and fat SPC charts and graphs for microbial levels and fat content are monitored for process assessment purposes on a daily basis.[11]\\r\\nNutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program and National School Breakfast program were updated in 2012. [1] This update in nutritional standards was funded through a federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama. The bill called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 funds free lunch programs in public schools for the next five years. [2] The new guidelines require students to choose either a serving of fruit or vegetables every meal. Also, the portions must now be larger. [3]\\r\\nAlong with larger portions of fruits and vegetables, the National School Lunch Program now enforces a variety of other nutritional requirements. Food products and ingredients used to prepare school meals must contain zero grams of added trans fat per serving (less than 0.5 grams per serving as defined by FDA). Furthermore, a meal can provide no more than 30 percent of calories from fat and less than 10 percent from saturated fat.[4]\\r\\nIn late 2009, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released School Meals: Building Blocks For Healthy Children.[12] This report reviews and provides recommendations to update the nutrition standard and the meal requirements for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. School Meals also sets standards for menu planning that focus on food groups, calories, saturated fat, and sodium, and that incorporate Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes.\\r\\nNutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children; undernourished children are more likely to be less energetic and less able to concentrate.[13] The day-to-day observation of teachers and administrators of the relationship between inadequate nutrition and behavior and ability to learn is substantiated by scientific studies. Twenty Cape Town, South Africa, children were studied for 11 years, beginning in 1955.-The study was based on the hypothesis \\"that the ill effects of under-nutrition are determined by (1) its occurrence during the period of maximum growth and (2) the duration of under-nutrition relative to the total period of growth. . . Evidence is cumulative and impressive that severe under-nutrition during the first 2 years of life, when brain growth is most active, results in a permanent reduction of brain size and restricted intellectual development. [14] Some basic micronutrients are necessary for children to maintain a good status of learning, such as iron and vitamin B-12.[15] Iron deficiency puts a child at risk of cognitive delay and lower math scores.[13]\\r\\nIn December 2009, a report was released that showed that fast food restaurants were far more rigorous in checking for bacteria and dangerous pathogens in beef and chicken than the school lunch program. \\"We simply are not giving our kids in schools the same level of quality and safety as you get when you go to many fast-food restaurants,\\" said J.?Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida. \\"We are not using those same standards.\\"[16]\\r\\nIn November 2011, an agriculture appropriations bill passed by Congress garnered controversy for blocking a proposed change by the Obama administration to school lunch regulations, whereby 1/8 cup of tomato paste would no longer have been considered as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/2 a cup of vegetables, but instead only as having the nutritional equivalent of 1/8 cup of vegetables (i.e.,?schools can only credit a volume of vegetables as equivalent to its actual size). Critics of this move by Congress claim that pressure was placed upon officials voting on the bill by lobbyists representing pizza manufacturers and cheese producers, as it was seen to threaten the ability of schools to serve pizza and credit it with the same level of nutritional value as they heretofore had.[citation needed] Many critics have sardonically summarized the situation as \\"Pizza is now a vegetable\\" or \\"Congress decides pizza is a vegetable\\".[citation needed] However, others have pointed out that 1/8 cup of tomato paste stacks up remarkably well against a 1/2 cup of vegetables nutritionally, albeit with an excessive amount of sodium that could be argued to reduce its nutritional value.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1967ÿ68, the national enrollment in public and private schools was approximately 50.7 million, according to a survey of School Food Services in March 1968. About 36.8 million children, or 73 percent, were enrolled in schools participating in the National School Lunch Program with an actual average participation in the program of 18.9 million children, or about 37 percent of the national enrollment.[17]\\r\\nReasons for non-participation in the program were numerous but, in low-income areas and large urban centers, low participation was particularly evident. Many of the school buildings in these areas, as well as the small schools in rural areas, were built many years before there were plans for operating a school lunch program, and the buildings did not lend themselves to remodeling for that purpose - neither were local funds available for it. Many of the elementary school buildings in urban centers were built with the idea that the children could and should go home for lunch (\\"neighborhood schools\\") and lunchroom facilities were not available. Many of these conditions hold true today.[17]\\r\\nSome school authorities hold to the idea that a school lunch program must be self-supporting, and others feel that the school has no responsibility in this area. According to a junior high school principal, \\"We think this is the responsibility of parents and child. We do not check them to see if a student eats. As a whole, we are doing it as a service rather than a need.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe net result is that the children in the neediest areas must go without an adequate noonday meal at school, or perhaps an inadequate evening meal at home, or none at all. Many high school students prefer to bring a bag lunch from home or eat snacks and beverages at a nearby stand or from a vending machine in the school. In some instances the portions served to high school students are not adjusted to meet their needs and they seek other sources of service where their tastes and appetites can be satisfied.[17]\\r\\nThe predominate reason, however, appears to be inadequate funding at federal, state and local levels, with the end result that the children who cannot afford to pay are the losers.[17]\\r\\nIn December 2014, Indian Country Today reported that 68 percent of Native American and Alaska Native students \\"are eligible for free and reduced-price school lunches, compared with 28 percent of white students. USDA data indicate that 70 percent of children receiving free lunches through the NSLP are children of color, as are 50 percent of students receiving reduced-price lunches.\\"[19] The article expressed concern regarding efforts to undercut nutrition standards, and notes that several Native American schools are working to improve the quality of school lunches by using produce from school gardens, or tribally grown buffalo meat.[19]\\r\\nThe current challenges of the NSLP can be broken down into three major categories: caloric and nutritional needs, food waste, and rising costs.\\r\\nFor some time, the measurement from which the NSLP based its cash-reimbursements and meal provisions largely came from caloric requirements. However, while this worked in a time where malnutrition plagued the nations poverty, the modern focus on caloric intake usurps the nations stance on the growing obesity epidemic. Balancing nutrition and calories has always been a challenge for the NSLP and its participating schools. This struggle can undermine schools that wish to comply with the national standards while still advocating healthy lifestyles.[20] Another problem that contributes to this challenge is that nutritious food is often considered less favorable than competitive food that is available to students. Given the choice, students will often prefer competitive foods that are not required to meet federal minimum nutrition standards.[21]\\r\\nIn the US, the term competitive foods refers to any food source that competes with a lunch program's offerings. Such competitive foods include fast food offerings, a la carte food lines, and vending machines.[22] A study was done in the 2009-2010 school year across 47 states and 622 districts to examine how much of districts' competitive food and drink policy complied with Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommendations.[22] One of the major reasons for this study to be done is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act which requires schools to establish a science-based nutrition standards for competitive foods called a wellness plan. These new provisions for competitive food and drinks included limits on specific nutrients in the food, such as sodium and fats.[22] Unfortunately, less than 5% of districts met or exceeded DGA requirements.[22] Only about 4% of districts across the nation required fruits and vegetables to be sold within the competitive foods which in no way helps the fruit and vegetable intake of students that is already sub-par.[22][23][24][25]\\r\\nChildren throw away much of the nutritious food that they are served. In a study of the Boston Public Schools, on average, students discarded roughly 19 percent of their entres, 47 percent of their fruit, 25 percent of their milk, and 73 percent of their vegetables. It was estimated that $432,349.05 worth of food is wasted annually at lunch by students in Grades 6ÿ8 in [Boston Public Schools]. Overall, this sum makes up 26.1 percent of these three schools food budgets, excluding labor and supplies. If translated nationally, Cohen estimates that roughly $1,238,846,400 in food is wasted on an annual basis. [26]\\r\\nOne reason that students discard this amount of food has to do with  la carte lines and vending machines. In a 1998 study of 16 randomly selected schools in St. Paul, Minnesota, the authors discovered a negative correlation between  la carte lines, vending machine use, and fruit and vegetable consumption. On average, students from schools without an  la carte line consumed nearly an entire serving more of fruit and vegetables than did students with such programs. Furthermore, students from all schools exceeded the daily USDA recommended calories from saturated fat, and students from schools with  la carte lines exceeded the recommendations by 1 percent more, on average. Concerning snack vending machines, the authors determined that with each vending machine present, students mean intake of fruit servings decreased by 11 percent. Beverage machines showed no significant impact.[27]\\r\\nA challenge for schools that take part in the NSLP is rising costs of producing lunch. According to the School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study (SLBCS), one in four school districts reported costs for school lunches above the program reimbursement rate. [28] The additional cost must then be supplemented by school district general funds, and this puts a strain on school district budgets. Additional costs also make it difficult to meet federally mandated nutrition requirements because using the best palatable foods for students becomes too expensive.\\r\\nAccording to the 2008 USDA report on the NSLP, other sources of increasing costs include increases in health care costs for employees and, more recently, rising food costs. [29] For example, in 2008, some school systems in Alabama, California, and Texas raised meal prices to keep up with steep increases in food costs. [30] The school districts raised prices for paying students, while keeping prices the same for students that qualified for reduced-price or free lunches. This method of cost adjustment leaves either the school district or paying students to bear the burden of the price increase.\\r\\nNational School Lunch Week takes place on the second Sunday in October.[31] On October 6, 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed National School Lunch Week.[32][33][34]","input":"When did the free school lunch program start?"},{"output":"inspired many Texiansboth Texas settlers and adventurers from the United Statesto join the Texian Army","context":"The Battle of the Alamo (February 23 ÿ March 6, 1836) was a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna launched an assault on the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de Bxar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States), killing all of the Texian defenders. Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texiansboth Texas settlers and adventurers from the United Statesto join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution.\\r\\nSeveral months previously, Texians had driven all Mexican troops out of Mexican Texas. About 100?Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo. The Texian force grew slightly with the arrival of reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Bxar as the first step in a campaign to retake Texas. For the next 10 days, the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties. Aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by such a large force, Travis wrote multiple letters pleading for more men and supplies, but the Texians were reinforced by fewer than 100 men.\\r\\nIn the early morning hours of March 6, the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo. After repelling two attacks, the Texians were unable to fend off a third attack. As Mexican soldiers scaled the walls, most of the Texian soldiers withdrew into interior buildings. Defenders unable to reach these points were slain by the Mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape. Between five and seven Texians may have surrendered; if so, they were quickly executed. Most eyewitness accounts reported between 182 and 257 Texians died, while most historians of the Alamo agree that around 600 Mexicans were killed or wounded. Several noncombatants were sent to Gonzales to spread word of the Texian defeat. The news sparked both a strong rush to join the Texian army and a panic, known as \\"The Runaway Scrape\\", in which the Texian army, most settlers, and the new Republic of Texas government fled eastward toward the United States ahead of the advancing Mexican Army.\\r\\nWithin Mexico, the battle has often been overshadowed by events from the MexicanÿAmerican War of 1846ÿ48. In 19th-century Texas, the Alamo complex gradually became known as a battle site rather than a former mission. The Texas Legislature purchased the land and buildings in the early part of the 20th century and designated the Alamo chapel as an official Texas State Shrine. The Alamo is now \\"the most popular tourist site in Texas\\".[5] The Alamo has been the subject of numerous non-fiction works beginning in 1843. Most Americans, however, are more familiar with the myths and legends spread by many of the movie and television adaptations,[6] including the 1950s Disney mini-series Davy Crockett and John Wayne's 1960 film The Alamo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder President Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna, the Mexican government began to shift away from a federalist model. The increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited many federalists to revolt.[7] The border region of Mexican Texas was largely populated by immigrants from the United States. These people were accustomed to a federalist government and to extensive individual rights, and they were quite vocal in their displeasure at Mexico's shift towards centralism.[8] Already suspicious after previous American attempts to purchase Mexican Texas,[9] Mexican authorities blamed much of the Texian unrest on American immigrants, most of whom had made little effort to adapt to the Mexican culture.[10]\\r\\nIn October, Texians engaged Mexican troops in the first official battle of the Texas Revolution.[11] Determined to quell the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force, the Army of Operations in Texas, to restore order.[12] Most of his soldiers were raw recruits,[13] and a large number had been forcibly conscripted.[14]\\r\\nThe Texians systematically defeated the Mexican troops already stationed in Texas. The last group of Mexican soldiers in the regioncommanded by Santa Anna's brother-in-law, General Martn Perfecto de Cossurrendered on December 9 following the siege of Bxar.[11] By this point, the Texian Army was dominated by very recent arrivals to the region, primarily adventurers from the United States. Many Texas settlers, unprepared for a long campaign, had returned home.[15] Angered by what he perceived to be American interference in Mexican affairs, Santa Anna spearheaded a resolution classifying foreigners found fighting in Texas as pirates. The resolution effectively banned the taking of prisoners of war: in this period of time, captured pirates were executed immediately.[15][16] Santa Anna reiterated this message in a strongly worded letter to United States President Andrew Jackson. This letter was not widely distributed, and it is unlikely that most of the American recruits serving in the Texian Army were aware that there would be no prisoners of war.[17]\\r\\nWhen Mexican troops departed San Antonio de Bxar (now San Antonio, Texas, USA) Texian soldiers established a garrison at the Alamo Mission, a former Spanish religious outpost which had been converted to a makeshift fort by the recently expelled Mexican Army.[18] Described by Santa Anna as an \\"irregular fortification hardly worthy of the name\\",[18] the Alamo had been designed to withstand an attack by native tribes, not an artillery-equipped army.[19] The complex sprawled across 3 acres (1.2?ha), providing almost 1,320 feet (400?m) of perimeter to defend.[20] An interior plaza was bordered on the east by the chapel and to the south by a one-story building known as the Low Barracks.[21] A wooden palisade stretched between these two buildings.[22] The two-story Long Barracks extended north from the chapel.[21] At the northern corner of the east wall stood a cattle pen and horse corral.[23] The walls surrounding the complex were at least 2.75 feet (0.84?m) thick and ranged from 9ÿ12?ft (2.7ÿ3.7?m) high.[24][Note 1]\\r\\nTo compensate for the lack of firing ports, Texian engineer Green B. Jameson constructed catwalks to allow defenders to fire over the walls; this method, however, left the rifleman's upper body exposed.[20] Mexican forces had left behind 19?cannons, which Jameson installed along the walls. A large 18-pounder had arrived in Texas with the New Orleans Greys. Jameson positioned this cannon in the southwest corner of the compound. He boasted to Texian Army commander Sam Houston that the Texians could \\"whip 10 to 1 with our artillery\\".[25]\\r\\nThe Texian garrison was woefully undermanned and underprovisioned, with fewer than 100?soldiers remaining by January 6, 1836.[26] Colonel James C. Neill, the acting Alamo commander, wrote to the provisional government: \\"If there has ever been a dollar here I have no knowledge of it\\".[26] Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing that the garrison was likely to be unable to withstand a siege lasting longer than four days.[26][27] The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance.[28][Note 2] Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army:[Note 3] on January 14, Neill approached one of them, Sam Houston, for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition.[28]\\r\\nHouston could not spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful defense.[29] Instead, he sent Colonel James Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery from the Alamo and destroy the complex.[28][Note 4] Bowie was unable to transport the artillery since the Alamo garrison lacked the necessary draft animals. Neill soon persuaded Bowie that the location held strategic importance.[30] In a letter to Governor Henry Smith, Bowie argued that \\"the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Bxar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine.\\"[31][Note 5] The letter to Smith ended, \\"Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy.\\"[31] Bowie also wrote to the provisional government, asking for \\"men, money, rifles, and cannon powder\\".[31] Few reinforcements were authorized; cavalry officer William B. Travis arrived in Bxar with 30?men on February 3. Five days later, a small group of volunteers arrived, including the famous frontiersman and former U.S. Congressman David Crockett of Tennessee.[32]\\r\\nOn February 11, Neill left the Alamo, determined to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies.[33][34] He transferred command to Travis, the highest-ranking regular army officer in the garrison.[31] Volunteers comprised much of the garrison, and they were unwilling to accept Travis as their leader.[Note 6] The men instead elected Bowie, who had a reputation as a fierce fighter, as their commander. Bowie celebrated by getting very intoxicated and creating havoc in Bxar. To mitigate the resulting ill feelings, Bowie agreed to share command with Travis.[34][35][36]\\r\\nAs the Texians struggled to find men and supplies, Santa Anna continued to gather men at San Luis Potosi; by the end of 1835 his army numbered 6,019 soldiers.[37] Rather than advance along the coast, where supplies and reinforcements could be easily delivered by sea, Santa Anna ordered his army inland to Bxar, the political center of Texas and the site of Cos's defeat.[37] The army began its march north in late December.[37] Officers used the long journey to train the men. Many of the new recruits did not know how to use the sights of their guns, and many refused to fire from the shoulder because of the large recoil.[38]\\r\\nProgress was slow. There were not enough mules to transport all of the supplies, and many of the teamsters, all civilians, quit when their pay was delayed. The large number of soldaderas ÿ women and children who followed the army ÿ consumed much of the already scarce supplies. The soldiers were soon reduced to partial rations.[39] On February 12 they crossed the Rio Grande.[40][Note 7] Temperatures in Texas reached record lows, and by February 13 an estimated 15ÿ16 inches (38ÿ41?cm) of snow had fallen. Hypothermia, dysentery, and Comanche raiding parties took a heavy toll on the Mexican soldiers.[41]\\r\\nOn February 21, Santa Anna and his vanguard reached the banks of the Medina River, 25 miles (40?km) from Bxar.[42][43] Unaware of the Mexican Army's proximity, the majority of the Alamo garrison joined Bxar residents at a fiesta.[44][Note 8] After learning of the planned celebration, Santa Anna ordered General Joaqun Ramrez y Sesma to immediately seize the unprotected Alamo, but sudden rains halted that raid.[43]\\r\\nIn the early hours of February 23, residents began fleeing Bxar, fearing the Mexican army's imminent arrival. Although unconvinced by the reports, Travis stationed a soldier in the San Fernando church bell tower, the highest location in town, to watch for signs of an approaching force. Several hours later, Texian scouts reported seeing Mexican troops 1.5 miles (2.4?km) outside the town.[44] Few arrangements had been made for a potential siege. One group of Texians scrambled to herd cattle into the Alamo, while others scrounged for food in the recently abandoned houses.[45] Several members of the garrison who had been living in town brought their families with them when they reported to the Alamo. Among these were Almaron Dickinson, who brought his wife Susanna and their infant daughter Angelina; Bowie, who was accompanied by his deceased wife's cousins, Gertrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, and Alsbury's young son;[46] and Gregorio Esparza, whose family climbed through the window of the Alamo chapel after the Mexican army arrived.[47] Other members of the garrison failed to report for duty; most of the men working outside Bxar did not try to sneak past Mexican lines.[48]\\r\\nresponse of Jos Bartres to Texian requests for an honorable surrender, as quoted in the journal of Juan Almonte[49]\\r\\nBy late afternoon Bxar was occupied by about 1,500 Mexican soldiers.[50] When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon.[51] Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna.[49] Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin.[52] Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and Jos Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional.[49] On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.[52][Note 9]\\r\\nThe first night of the siege was relatively quiet.[53] Over the next few days, Mexican soldiers established artillery batteries, initially about 1,000 feet (300?m) from the south and east walls of the Alamo.[54] A third battery was positioned southeast of the fort. Each night the batteries inched closer to the Alamo walls.[55] During the first week of the siege more than 200 cannonballs landed in the Alamo plaza. At first, the Texians matched Mexican artillery fire, often reusing the Mexican cannonballs.[56][57] On February 26 Travis ordered the artillery to conserve powder and shot.[56]\\r\\nTwo notable events occurred on Wednesday, February 24. At some point that day, Bowie collapsed from illness,[58] leaving Travis in sole command of the garrison.[58] Late that afternoon, two Mexican scouts became the first fatalities of the siege.[59][Note 9] The following morning, 200ÿ300 Mexican soldiers crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks near the Alamo walls.[55][59][60] Several Texians ventured out to burn the huts[60] while Texians within the Alamo provided cover fire.[61][62] After a two-hour skirmish, the Mexican troops retreated to Bxar.[55][62] Six Mexican soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.[55] No Texians were injured.[63]\\r\\nA blue norther blew in on February 25, dropping the temperature to 39?F (4?C).[56] Neither army was prepared for the cold temperatures.[64] Texian attempts to gather firewood were thwarted by Mexican troops.[56] On the evening of February 26 Colonel Juan Bringas engaged several Texians who were burning more huts.[65] According to historian J.R. Edmondson, one Texian was killed.[66] Four days later, Texians shot and killed Private First Class Secundino Alvarez, a soldier from one of two battalions that Santa Anna had stationed on two sides of the Alamo. By March 1, the number of Mexican casualties were nine dead and four wounded, while the Texian garrison had lost only one man.\\r\\nexcerpt from William B. Travis's letter To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World.[67]\\r\\nSanta Anna posted one company east of the Alamo, on the road to Gonzales.[55][68] Almonte and 800?dragoons were stationed along the road to Goliad.[69] Throughout the siege these towns had received multiple couriers, dispatched by Travis to plead for reinforcements and supplies.[51][70] The most famous of his missives, written February 24, was addressed To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World. According to historian Mary Deborah Petite, the letter is \\"considered by many as one of the masterpieces of American patriotism.\\"[71] Copies of the letter were distributed across Texas,[72] and eventually reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe.[59] At the end of the first day of the siege, Santa Anna's troops were reinforced by 600 men under General Joaquin Ramirez y Sesma, bringing the Mexican army up to more than 2,000 men.\\r\\nAs news of the siege spread throughout Texas, potential reinforcements gathered in Gonzales. They hoped to rendezvous with Colonel James Fannin, who was expected to arrive from Goliad with his garrison.[73] On February 26, after days of indecision, Fannin ordered 320?men, four?cannons, and several supply wagons to march towards the Alamo, 90 miles (140?km) away. This group traveled less than 1.0 mile (1.6?km) before turning back.[74][75] Fannin blamed the retreat on his officers; the officers and enlisted men accused Fannin of aborting the mission.[76]\\r\\nTexians gathered in Gonzales were unaware of Fannin's return to Goliad, and most continued to wait. Impatient with the delay, on February 27 Travis ordered Samuel G. Bastian to go to Gonzales \\"to hurry up reinforcements\\".[77] According to historian Thomas Ricks Lindley, Bastian encountered the Gonzales Ranging Company led by Lieutenant George C. Kimble and Travis' courier to Gonzales, Albert Martin, who had tired of waiting for Fannin. A Mexican patrol attacked, driving off four of the men including Bastian.[Note 10][78] In the darkness, the Texians fired on the remaining 32?men, whom they assumed were Mexican soldiers. One man was wounded, and his English curses convinced the defenders to open the gates.[Note 11][79]\\r\\nOn March 3, the Texians watched from the walls as approximately 1,000 Mexicans marched into Bxar. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General Jos de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27.[80] Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration to the arrival of Santa Anna. The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Bxar to almost 3,100.[81]\\r\\nThe arrival of the Mexican reinforcements prompted Travis to send three men, including Davy Crockett, to find Fannin's force, which he still believed to be en route.[82] The scouts discovered a large group of Texians camped 20 miles (32?km) from the Alamo.[83] Lindley's research indicates that up to 50 of these men had come from Goliad after Fannin's aborted rescue mission. The others had left Gonzales several days earlier.[84] Just before daylight on March 4, part of the Texian force broke through Mexican lines and entered the Alamo. Mexican soldiers drove a second group across the prairie.[83][Note 12]\\r\\nOn March 4, the day after his reinforcements arrived, Santa Anna proposed an assault on the Alamo. Many of his senior officers recommended that they wait for two 12-pounder cannons anticipated to arrive on March 7.[85] That evening, a local woman, likely Bowie's cousin-in-law Juana Navarro Alsbury, approached Santa Anna to negotiate a surrender for the Alamo defenders.[86] According to many historians, this visit probably increased Santa Anna's impatience; as historian Timothy Todish noted, \\"there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory\\".[87] The following morning, Santa Anna announced to his staff that the assault would take place early on March 6. Santa Anna arranged for troops from Bxar to be excused from the front lines so that they would not be forced to fight their own families.[87]\\r\\nLegend holds that at some point on March 5, Travis gathered his men and explained that an attack was imminent, and that they were greatly outnumbered by the Mexican Army. He supposedly drew a line in the ground and asked those willing to die for the Texian cause to cross and stand alongside him; only one man (Moses Rose) was said to have declined.[88] Most scholars disregard this tale as there is no primary source evidence to support it (the story only surfaced decades after the battle in a third-hand account).[89] However, Travis apparently did, at some point prior to the final assault, assemble the men for a conference to inform them of the dire situation and giving them the chance to either escape or stay and die for the cause. Susannah Dickinson recalled Travis announcing that any men who wished to escape should let it be known and step out of ranks.[90]\\r\\nThe last Texian verified to have left the Alamo was James Allen, a courier who carried personal messages from Travis and several of the other men on March 5.[91]\\r\\nAt 10?p.m. on March 5, the Mexican artillery ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, the exhausted Texians soon fell into the first uninterrupted sleep many of them had since the siege began.[94] Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault.[95] Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel Jos Mara Romero and Colonel Juan Morales.[92][93] Veterans were positioned on the outside of the columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle.[96] As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves.[93][97] Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements.[93] Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers.[98]\\r\\nAt 5:30?a.m. troops silently advanced. Cos and his men approached the northwest corner of the Alamo,[96] while Duque led his men from the northwest towards a repaired breach in the Alamo's north wall.[99] The column commanded by Romero marched towards the east wall, and Morales's column aimed for the low parapet by the chapel.[99]\\r\\nThe three Texian sentinels stationed outside the walls were killed in their sleep,[100][101] allowing Mexican soldiers to approach undetected within musket range of the walls.[100] At this point, the silence was broken by shouts of \\"?Viva Santa Anna!\\" and music from the buglers.[95] The noise woke the Texians.[101] Most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety.[102] Travis rushed to his post yelling, \\"Come on boys, the Mexicans are upon us and we'll give them hell!\\"[100] and, as he passed a group of Tejanos, \\"?No rendirse, muchachos!\\" (\\"Don't surrender, boys\\").[94]\\r\\nIn the initial moments of the assault, Mexican troops were at a disadvantage. Their column formation allowed only the front rows of soldiers to fire safely.[103] Unaware of the dangers, the untrained recruits in the ranks \\"blindly fir[ed] their guns\\", injuring or killing the troops in front of them.[104] The tight concentration of troops also offered an excellent target for the Texian artillery.[103] Lacking canister shot, Texians filled their cannon with any metal they could find, including door hinges, nails, and chopped-up horseshoes, essentially turning the cannon into giant shotguns.[100] According to the diary of Jos Enrique de la Pe?a, \\"a single cannon volley did away with half the company of chasseurs from Toluca\\".[105] Duque fell from his horse after suffering a wound in his thigh and was almost trampled by his own men. General Manuel Castrill܇n quickly assumed command of Duque's column.[23]\\r\\nAlthough some in the front of the Mexican ranks wavered, soldiers in the rear pushed them on.[103] As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury.[103] Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls.[106] The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.[23]\\r\\nMexican soldiers withdrew and regrouped, but their second attack was repulsed. Fifteen minutes into the battle, they attacked a third time.[23][103] During the third strike, Romero's column, aiming for the east wall, was exposed to cannon fire and shifted to the north, mingling with the second column.[23] Cos' column, under fire from Texians on the west wall, also veered north.[107] When Santa Anna saw that the bulk of his army was massed against the north wall, he feared a rout; \\"panicked\\", he sent the reserves into the same area.[108] The Mexican soldiers closest to the north wall realized that the makeshift wall contained many gaps and toeholds. One of the first to scale the 12-foot (3.7 m) wall was General Juan Amador; at his challenge, his men began swarming up the wall. Amador opened the postern in the north wall, allowing Mexican soldiers to pour into the complex.[106] Others climbed through gun ports in the west wall, which had few defenders.[109] As the Texian defenders abandoned the north wall and the northern end of the west wall,[106][109] Texian gunners at the south end of the mission turned their cannon towards the north and fired into the advancing Mexican soldiers. This left the south end of the mission unprotected; within minutes Mexican soldiers had climbed the walls and killed the gunners, gaining control of the Alamo's 18-pounder cannon.[98] By this time Romero's men had taken the east wall of the compound and were pouring in through the cattle pen.[109]\\r\\nLast words of Texian defender Almaron Dickinson to his wife Susanna as he prepared to defend the chapel.[107]\\r\\nAs previously planned, most of the Texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire.[107] Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50?Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.[110]\\r\\nThe defenders in the cattle pen retreated into the horse corral. After discharging their weapons, the small band of Texians scrambled over the low wall, circled behind the church and raced on foot for the east prairie, which appeared empty.[107][109][111] As the Mexican cavalry advanced on the group, Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry, probably inflicting casualties. Nevertheless, all of the escaping Texians were killed.[111]\\r\\nThe last Texian group to remain in the open were Crockett and his men, defending the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church.[110] The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls.[112] Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.[Note 13][113]\\r\\nFor the next hour, the Mexican army worked to secure complete control of the Alamo.[114] Many of the remaining defenders were ensconced in the fortified barracks rooms.[115] In the confusion, the Texians had neglected to spike their cannon before retreating. Mexican soldiers turned the cannon towards the barracks.[106] As each door was blown off Mexican soldiers would fire a volley of muskets into the dark room, then charge in for hand-to-hand combat.[115]\\r\\nToo sick to participate in the battle, Bowie likely died in bed. Eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of his death. Some witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him alive from the room.[116] Others claimed that Bowie shot himself or was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head.[117] According to historian Wallace Chariton, the \\"most popular, and probably the most accurate\\"[118] version is that Bowie died on his cot, \\"back braced against the wall, and using his pistols and his famous knife.\\"[117]\\r\\nThe last of the Texians to die were the 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannons in the chapel.[113][119] A shot from the 18-pounder cannon destroyed the barricades at the front of the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death.[120] Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder.[120] Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.[121]\\r\\nAs soldiers approached the sacristy, one of the young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders.[120] In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him.[Note 14][122] Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker,[123] who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women.[124] Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy.[120] Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.[122][125]\\r\\nBy 6:30?a.m. the battle for the Alamo was over.[124] Mexican soldiers inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved.[122] Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15?minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.[126]\\r\\nAccording to many accounts of the battle, between five and seven Texians surrendered.[Note 15][127][128] Incensed that his orders had been ignored, Santa Anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors.[129] Weeks after the battle, stories circulated that Crockett was among those who surrendered.[128] However, Ben, a former American slave who cooked for one of Santa Anna's officers, maintained that Crockett's body was found surrounded by \\"no less than sixteen Mexican corpses\\".[130] Historians disagree on which version of Crockett's death is accurate.[Note 16][131]\\r\\nSanta Anna reportedly told Captain Fernando Urizza that the battle \\"was but a small affair\\".[132] Another officer then remarked that \\"with another such victory as this, we'll go to the devil\\".[Note 17][2] In his initial report Santa Anna claimed that 600?Texians had been killed, with only 70?Mexican soldiers killed and 300?wounded.[133] His secretary, Ram܇n Martnez Caro, later repudiated the report.[134] Other estimates of the number of Mexican soldiers killed ranged from 60ÿ200, with an additional 250ÿ300 wounded.[2] Most Alamo historians place the number of Mexican casualties at 400ÿ600.[2][3][4] This would represent about one-third of the Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault, which Todish remarks is \\"a tremendous casualty rate by any standards\\".[2] Most eyewitnesses counted between 182ÿ257 Texians killed.[135] Some historians believe that at least one Texian, Henry Warnell, successfully escaped from the battle. Warnell died several months later of wounds incurred either during the final battle or during his escape as a courier.[136][137]\\r\\nMexican soldiers were buried in the local cemetery, Campo Santo.[Note 18][133] Shortly after the battle, Colonel Jos Juan Sanchez Navarro proposed that a monument should be erected to the fallen Mexican soldiers. Cos rejected the idea.[138]\\r\\nThe Texian bodies were stacked and burned.[Note 19][133] The only exception was the body of Gregorio Esparza. His brother Francisco, an officer in Santa Anna's army, received permission to give Gregorio a proper burial.[133] The ashes were left where they fell until February 1837, when Juan Segun returned to Bxar to examine the remains. A simple coffin inscribed with the names Travis, Crockett, and Bowie was filled with ashes from the funeral pyres.[139] According to a March 28, 1837, article in the Telegraph and Texas Register,[140] Segun buried the coffin under a peach tree grove. The spot was not marked and cannot now be identified.[141] Segun later claimed that he had placed the coffin in front of the altar at the San Fernando Cathedral. In July 1936 a coffin was discovered buried in that location, but according to historian Wallace Chariton, it is unlikely to actually contain the remains of the Alamo defenders. Fragments of uniforms were found in the coffin, and it is known that the Alamo defenders did not wear uniforms.[140]\\r\\nIn an attempt to convince other slaves in Texas to support the Mexican government over the Texian rebellion, Santa Anna spared Travis' slave, Joe.[142] The day after the battle, he interviewed each noncombatant individually. Impressed with Susanna Dickinson, Santa Anna offered to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico City. Dickinson refused the offer, which was not extended to Juana Navarro Alsbury although her son was of similar age.[2] Each woman was given a blanket and two silver pesos.[143] Alsbury and the other Tejano women were allowed to return to their homes in Bxar; Dickinson, her daughter and Joe were sent to Gonzales, escorted by Ben. They were encouraged to relate the events of the battle, and to inform the remainder of the Texian forces that Santa Anna's army was unbeatable.[2]\\r\\nDuring the siege, newly elected delegates from across Texas met at the Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates declared independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400?volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.[144]\\r\\nWithin hours of Houston's arrival on March 11, Andres Barcenas and Anselmo Bergaras arrived with news that the Alamo had fallen and all Texians were slain.[145] Hoping to halt a panic, Houston arrested the men as enemy spies. They were released hours later when Susannah Dickinson and Joe reached Gonzales and confirmed the report.[146] Realizing that the Mexican army would soon advance towards the Texian settlements, Houston advised all civilians in the area to evacuate and ordered his new army to retreat.[147] This sparked a mass exodus, known as the Runaway Scrape, and most Texians, including members of the new government, fled east.[148]\\r\\nDespite their losses at the Alamo, the Mexican army in Texas still outnumbered the Texian army by almost six to one.[149] Santa Anna assumed that knowledge of the disparity in troop numbers and the fate of the Texian soldiers at the Alamo would quell the resistance,[150] and that Texian soldiers would quickly leave the territory.[151] News of the Alamo's fall had the opposite effect, however, and men flocked to join Houston's army.[150] The New York Post editorialized that \\"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren\\".[152]\\r\\nOn the afternoon of April 21 the Texian army attacked Santa Anna's camp near Lynchburg Ferry. The Mexican army was taken by surprise, and the Battle of San Jacinto was essentially over after 18?minutes. During the fighting, many of the Texian soldiers repeatedly cried \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" as they slaughtered fleeing Mexican troops.[153] Santa Anna was captured the following day, and reportedly told Houston: \\"That man may consider himself born to no common destiny who has conquered the Napoleon of the West. And now it remains for him to be generous to the vanquished.\\" Houston replied, \\"You should have remembered that at the Alamo\\". Santa Anna's life was spared, and he was forced to order his troops out of Texas, ending Mexican control of the province and bestowing some legitimacy on the new republic.[154]\\r\\nFollowing the battle, Santa Anna was alternately viewed as a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint.[155] Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe that some of the stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna.[131] In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the MexicanÿAmerican War of 1846ÿ48.[155]\\r\\nIn San Antonio de Bxar, the largely Tejano population viewed the Alamo complex as more than just a battle site; it represented decades of assistanceas a mission, a hospital, or a military post.[156] As the English-speaking population increased, the complex became best known for the battle. Focus has centered primarily on the Texian defenders, with little emphasis given to the role of the Tejano soldiers who served in the Texian army or the actions of the Mexican army.[157] In the early 20th century the Texas Legislature purchased the property and appointed the Daughters of the Republic of Texas as permanent caretakers[158] of what is now an official state shrine.[5] In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph, designed by Pompeo Coppini, which commemorates the Texians and Tejanos who died during the battle.[159] According to Bill Groneman's Battlefields of Texas, the Alamo has become \\"the most popular tourist site in Texas\\".[5]\\r\\nThe first English-language histories of the battle were written and published by Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown.[160] The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's The Fall of the Alamo, published in The Magazine of American History in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews with many of the Mexican survivors of the battle.[160][161] The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers' The Alamo, was published in 1948.[162] In the decades since, the battle has featured prominently in many non-fiction works.\\r\\nAccording to Todish et al., \\"there can be little doubt that most Americans have probably formed many of their opinions on what occurred at the Alamo not from books, but from the various movies made about the battle.\\"[163] The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when Gaston Mlis directed The Immortal Alamo.[6] The battle became more widely known after it was featured in the 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett, which was largely based on myth.[6] Within several years, John Wayne directed and starred in one of the best-known, but questionably accurate, film versions, 1960's The Alamo.[164][Note 20] Another film also called The Alamo was released in 2004. CNN described it as possibly \\"the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject\\". It is also considered more faithful to the actual events than other movies.[165]\\r\\nA number of songwriters have been inspired by the Battle of the Alamo. Tennessee Ernie Ford's \\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\\" spent 16?weeks on the country music charts, peaking at No. 4 in 1955.[166] Marty Robbins recorded a version of the song \\"The Ballad of the Alamo\\" in 1960 which spent 13?weeks on the pop charts, peaking at No. 34.[167] Jane Bowers' song \\"Remember the Alamo\\" has been recorded by artists including Johnny Cash[168] and Donovan.[169] Singer-songwriter Phil Collins collected hundreds of items related to the battle, narrated a light and sound show about the Alamo, and has spoken at related events.[170] In 2014 Collins donated his entire collection to the Alamo via the State of Texas.[171][172]\\r\\nThe U.S. Post Office issued two postage stamps in commemoration of Texas Statehood[173] and the Battle of Alamo.[174]\\r\\nCoordinates: 292532N 982910W? / ?29.42556N 98.48611W? / 29.42556; -98.48611","input":"Why was the siege of the alamo significant?"},{"output":"4.5 slots (4 direct slots and 1 inter-confederation play-off slot)","context":"The Asian section of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification acted as qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, to be held in Russia, for national teams which are members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

Several theologians succeeded Zwingli, the best known of which is John Calvin in Geneva, but other reformers like John Oecolampadius, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Wolfgang Musculus were also very influential in the development of Reformed theology.\\r\\nReformed faith spread throughout Europe in the 16th century, with different character in different places. Calvinism was the dominant form of Protestantism in France. After a period of struggle Calvinists were officially tolerated there. Under the leadership of John Knox the Church of Scotland, which was Reformed, became the established church in Scotland. In the Netherlands, Calvinism also became the official established religion following a period of persecution. During the Reformation, Calvinism was the primary Protestant faith in Belgium but was eradicated in favor of the Counter-Reformation. Germany remained predominantly Lutheran during the 16th century, but Reformed worship was promoted intermittently by rulers in Electoral Palatinate, Margraviate of Brandenburg, and other German states. Reformed ideas also influenced Protestants in Eastern Europe, especially Hungary and Romania. The reform of the Church of England was also influenced by Reformed theologians, and remained so throughout the 16th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHuldrych Zwingli, whose theology is considered the first expression of Reformed theology[1] was appointed to ministry in Zrich, Switzerland, in 1519.[2] He was influenced by Renaissance humanist Desiderius Erasmus, which led him to study the New Testament and the early Church Fathers as well as to preach from the Bible.[3] Zwingli was also aware of and influenced by the Wittenberg reformer Martin Luther, but he developed his theology independently and differed with him in several ways. Zwingli opposed any religious practice for which he could find no scriptural justification, such as the use of images, organs, and singing in worship while Luther actively opposed the destruction of images in churches. Zwingli's emphasis on strict adherence to God's command as found in his word also lead to greater moral activism in Zwinglian Reformation movements than in Lutheran ones.[4]\\r\\nMartin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, John Oecolampadius, and Guillaume Farel were also influential figures in the development of Reformed theology. These reformers came from diverse academic backgrounds, but later distinctives of Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially the priority of scripture as a source of authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a covenantal view of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper as visible signs of the covenant of grace. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's supper. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of particular election (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for salvation). Martin Luther and his successor Philipp Melanchthon were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of justification by faith alone was a direct inheritance from Luther.[5]\\r\\nAt first Zwingli regarded Luther as an ally, and union between the followers of Zwingli and Luther may have been possible but for controversies over the Eucharist beginning in 1524. Luther strongly believed it necessary to maintain that Christ is physically present in the Eucharist, while Zwingli along with his followers including John Oecolampadius in Basel favored a symbolic meaning to the rite which would be called sacramentarianism. Martin Bucer in Strasbourg took a mediating position. Luther labeled Zwingli, Oecolapadius, and others who took this view blasphemous, un-Christian, and fanatic.[6] In 1529, German prince Philip of Hesse arranged the Marburg Colloquy as an attempt to reconcile the warring Protestant factions and forge an alliance. The two sides agreed on many points of doctrine but could find no common ground on the Eucharist, and Philip's hope for an alliance failed.[7]\\r\\nThroughout the 1520s, Zwingli's influence grew in Switzerland,[8] though many Swiss, especially in rural and forest areas, remained loyal to the Catholic church and opposed Zwingli's reforms.[9] Before 1530, some southern German cities supported Zwingli, and some German Lutheran theologians in other areas of Germany developed sacramentarian views independently of Zwingli, but they were quickly silenced by Lutheran theologians in Wittenberg.[10] In 1530, Phillip of Hesse formed the Schmalkaldic League, solidifying the Lutherans' hold on Germany to the exclusion of Zwinglianism.[11] Meanwhile, Zwingli began to use force aggressively to solidify Protestant gains in Switzerland. Following success against Catholics in the First War of Kappel of 1529, Zurich enforced a harsh blockade on Catholic cantons, leading to the Second War of Kappel in 1531. The Zurichers were defeated, and Zwingli was killed in the battle. Catholics continued to hold power in a majority of Swiss cantons, though three-fifths of the population was Protestant.[12]\\r\\nJohn Calvin is the most well-known Reformed theologian of the generation following Zwingli's death, but recent scholarship has argued that several previously overlooked individuals had at least as much influence on the development of Reformed Christianity and represented diverse theological viewpoints.[13] Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli's successor in Zurich, wrote more accessibly than his predecessor and his writings turned into rainbows distribution long after his death.[14] Following Zwingli he argued for a figurative significance of the Eucharist.[15] Peter Martyr Vermigli, the most highly trained Reformed theologian of this era,[16] taught a strong doctrine of double predestination, which teaches that God has chosen to save people for salvation and others for damnation, and held that Christ was really, though spiritually, present in the Eucharist, a position that Calvin would also take.[17] Wolfgang Musculus's Common Places of the Christian Religion was the first Reformed systematic work of theology. Musculus taught a spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist and a cautious form of double predestination.[18]\\r\\nWhile Reformed ideas and churches found ever widening distribution during this period, reaching as far as England and Poland, Lutheranism also increased its dominance in the Holy Roman Empire.[19] The Augsburg Interim of 1548, a settlement between Holy Roman emperor Charles V and Protestants resulting from the Schmalkaldic War, made some concessions to Protestants but forced those who wished to practice their religion legally to adopt practices which the Reformed found repugnant.[20] Some isolated Reformed churches were able to hold on in Germany including a church in Emden led by Polish reformer Jan ?aski which became an important center for Protestant refugees from the Low Countries. [21] London and a few other cities in England; Wesel, Aachen, and Frankfurt, Germany; and Geneva, Switzerland were also important cities for Reformed refugees from the Low Countries, northern France, and other areas of the Holy Roman Empire where they were not tolerated. \\"Stranger churches\\" were established in these cities for refugee Protestants.[22]\\r\\nThe Reformed movement was complex and variegated during this period, but the French reformer of Geneva John Calvin was arguably the most influential Reformed theologian of his time and his impact was long-lasting. His Institutes of the Christian Religion was widely distributed and considered by some to be the most important work of theology of the era.[23] The Genevan Consistory, a church counsel made up of lay and clergy members which was given power to enforce morals legislation and excommunicate citizens, became a dominant force in everyday life. This relative ecclesiastical independence from civil authority was a rare achievement and considered by many to be the Reformed ideal.[24]\\r\\nThe Reformed faith took different shapes in different parts of Europe. In France, groups of Christians influenced by Protestant writers (who became known as Huguenots) formed secretly and started underground churches and informal Bible reading groups.[25] Ministers were dispatched from Geneva and other Swiss cities along with a massive outpouring of propaganda which assured the Reformed nature of the French Reformation. Calvin also aided in the creation of the French Confession of Faith in 1559. The French Protestants did gain some notable allies, including Rene of France, daughter of King Louis XII, as well as Queen Jeanne III of Navarre and her son, Henry (who later converted to Roman Catholicism upon ascending the throne of France). The newly formed churches developed a presbyterial system of church government with national and regional synods.[26] The network of synods proved helpful in mobilizing Reformed Christians to military resistance during the French Wars of Religion between Protestants and Catholics from 1562 to 1598.[27] Calvin's successor in Geneva Theodore Beza also argued in his Right of Magistrates that armed resistance against tyrannical rulers was justified, which contradicted Calvin's earlier insistence on civil obedience and emboldened Huguenots to fight.[28] The wars of religion left the French Reformed church between one-third and one-half the size of that at which it began with limited freedom to practice their religion, though intermittent conflicts continued. Unlike in the Genevan model and many other early Reformed churches, the Reformed Church in France remained relatively independent of the state.[29]\\r\\nJohn Willock, who had been exiled to Emden, and John Knox, who had spent five years exiled in Geneva, were the most influential figures of the Scottish Reformation. Knox preached to Scottish noblemen from 1555ÿ56, though he did not encourage the establishment of independent churches as was done in France. In 1557 a group of noblemen known as the Lords of the Congregation swore an oath, following a Scottish custom, to promote Protestant reforms in churches.[30] Knox and Willock encouraged radical militant action even on the part of independent laypeople in areas where Catholic practices were re-instituted.[31] In 1560 the Scottish Parliament adopted the broadly Reformed Scots Confession and instituted the Church of Scotland along Reformed lines, though bishops were retained within a presbyterial system.[32] Despite the success of the Reformed in Scotland many people retained Catholic practices such as holy days and pilgrimages and the majority of parishes did not have qualified Reformed ministers by the end of the century.[33]\\r\\nThe Netherlands was affected by Reformation ideas early on due to linguistic and commercial ties with Germany.[34] Though early Protestantism in the Netherlands was not exclusively Reformed in nature, and many early Protestant churches sought to allow both Lutheran and Reformed adherents within the same congregations, the influence of refugee centers in Emden and England lead to a decidedly Reformed orientation to these churches.[35] A mass outbreak of iconoclasm in 1566 (known as the Beeldenstorm) prompted by popular open-air Protestant preaching lead to temporary toleration of Protestant preaching, and gradually administration of the sacraments, by magistrates in many Dutch cities.[36] Military action initiated by Governor of the Netherlands Margaret of Parma later that year intended as punishment for the iconoclastic outbreaks brought an end to Reformed worship.[37] Starting in 1572, many Dutch cities invited or allowed the invasion of exiled Netherlandish privateers known as Sea Beggars because they were dissatisfied with the overbearing rule of the Spanish \\"iron duke\\" of Alva, and Reformed worship was reinstated either immediately or gradually.[38] The Dutch Reformed Church became the legally privileged religion in most of the region, though Catholicism and other Protestant sects were tolerated and a minority of the population became full members of the Reformed church.[39]\\r\\nThere was frequent interchange between Swiss and German Protestants early in the Reformation, and Bucer's Strasbourg had some Reformed characteristics, but Germany remained firmly Lutheran and anti-Calvinist through 1560.[40] Following the death of Lutheran Wittenberg reformer Philipp Melanchthon in 1560, Frederick III, Elector Palatine began to promote the Reformed faith in his own realm. He invited two students of Calvin, Zacharias Ursinus and Kaspar Olevianus, to the university city of Heidelberg in 1561. The two men co-operated in writing the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563 to replace the conflicting catechisms currently circulating in the realm.[41] Despite opposition from the Holy Roman Emperor and other German princes, Frederick continued to institute Reformed worship in the Palatinate. In 1566 he was called to appear at the Diet of Augsburg to account for his violation of the Treaty of Augsburg. His testimony was so impressive that no action was taken against him, leaving the Palatinate free to continue in a Reformed direction.[42] Frederick died in 1576 and was succeeded by his son Louis VI, who was not friendly to the Reformed faith. 600 Reformed professors and ministers were expelled.[43] These refugees scattered to various cities. In 1583, John Casimir restored the Reformed faith in the Palatinate, and this policy was continued by his successor Frederick IV. Some other German states and cities also adopted the Heidelberg Catechism and the Reformed faith.[44]\\r\\nPolish priests began instituting reforms influenced by Calvin starting in the 1550s. In 1556 a diet at Piotrk܇w officially instituted several Protestant reforms. Jan ?aski returned to Poland and unsuccessfully attempted to unite the Reformed with the Polish Brethren and Lutherans. In 1575 King Stephen Bthory abandoned Protestantism, leading to the virtual extinction of the Polish Reformed Church.[45] In Bohemia, Reformed ideas began to influence the Unity of the Brethren from the 1540s through Czech students at German and Swiss universities. Emperor Maximilian II tolerated Lutheran and Reformed worship in Bohemia through 1600, and many Bohemian nobles established Reformed worship on their estates.[46] The influence of Calvinism in Swiss and German schools also affected Hungary and Transylvania, with the establishment of the Reformed Church of Hungary in 1576.[47]\\r\\nReformed ideas influenced the English Reformation through Peter Martyr Vermigli, Martin Bucer, and Jan ?aski, with whom Archbishop Thomas Cranmer consulted during the reign of Edward VI. The vestments controversy beginning in 1550, in which John Hooper refused to wear a surplice, was the first manifestation of Puritanism. Puritans were characteristically more rigid on issues of worship (such as kneeling at communion) than some of their predecessors such as Calvin, Bucer, and Knox.[48] On the succession of Mary I in 1553, Protestants were forced into exile, many of them in Geneva and Zurich.[49] On the death of Mary and succession of Elizabeth I in 1558, many of these exiles returned and Reformed ideas continued to influence the direction of the Reformation. While doctrinally the Church of England during this time was generally Reformed in character, she retained an episcopal polity. Criticism of episcopacy took a number of forms, with some Reformed writers being more tolerant of it than others.[50] An attempt to move the church towards presbyterian polity was put down around 1588.[51]\\r\\nIn 1603, the controversial Jacobus Arminius, who had questioned the established Calvinism of the Dutch Reformed Church was appointed as a professor of the University of Leiden. The move served to exacerbate tensions within the Reformed Church, including a heated period of debate between Arminius and fellow Leiden faculty member Franciscus Gomarus beginning 1604. Following the death of Arminius in 1609, a group of followers of Arminius, known as Arminians, published the Five Articles of Remonstrance. In 1618, the teachings came under scrutiny at the Synod of Dort. The resulting judgments, the Canons of Dort, issued in 1619, condemned the teachings. The Canons would also join the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism as the third confessional standard of the Dutch Reformed Church. Between the beginning of the 17th century until 1750, the Dutch Reformed Church also went through the Nadere Reformatie, or \\"Further Reformation.\\" This movement had been influenced in part by English Puritanism, and had Wilhelmus  Brakel and Gisbertus Voetius as prominent leaders.\\r\\nIn 1652, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope. Many settlers were members of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Netherlands, and in 1665, they received their first minister. Despite having their own consistory, the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk was under the control of the Dutch Reformed Church in Amsterdam.\\r\\nCalvinism got a support in Germany in 1604 when Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel converted from Lutheranism. Unfortunately, his conversion prompted serious backlash against the Calvinists from the predominantly Lutheran population in Hesse.[52] In 1613, the Calvinists gained another prominent convert, John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg. Eventually, Brandenburg would become a bi-confessional state, allowing for both Lutheranism and Calvinism, and the Electors of Brandenburg often advocated for their persecuted Calvinist brethren.\\r\\nIn 1618, the Thirty Years' War broke out, leading to a tumultuous time for the German Reformed. Invading Roman Catholics besieged Heidelberg in 1622, severely damaging the city and persecuting many Reformed believers. Five years later, in 1627, Maximilian I of Bavaria demanded the citizens of Heidelberg to convert to Roman Catholicism, yet they refused to do so, saying that they would rather forfeit their property than give up their Reformed faith. For decades following the end of the war, the Reformed enjoyed peace and stability. The Peace of Prague in 1635 had guaranteed legal recognition and protection for the Reformed. However, in 1685 the Calvinist, and childless, Charles II, Elector Palatine died, and was succeeded by the Catholic Philip William. Three years later, a dispute over the who was the legitimate ruler of the Palatinate prompted King Louis XIV of France to invade, leading to a wave of persecution of Protestants and the destruction of the city of Heidelberg. The Treaty of Ryswick put an end to violent persecution, yet, subsequent leaders put further pressure on the German Reformed.\\r\\nThe Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Sweden and Norway had adopted Lutheranism early on, making it the official religion of their states. In 1667 however, the future King Christian V of Denmark married the staunchly Reformed Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel. As part of the marriage agreement, a Reformed minister was allowed to reside in Copenhagen as Charlotte's chaplain, but her Reformed faith prevented her from being crowned after becoming queen in 1670. In 1684, Christian V allowed for freedom of worship to non-Lutherans, and four years later, in 1688, the queen herself laid the cornerstone for the first Reformed church building. French Huguenots established the first and only Reformed body in Sweden in the late 18th century.\\r\\nIn the British Isles, there were three established churches, the Church of England, the Church of Scotland and the Church of Ireland. The Church of England had adopted the mildly Calvinistic Thirty-Nine Articles and the more explicitly Calvinistic Lambeth Articles, both of which had been written in the second half of the 16th century. The Church of Scotland adhered to the Calvinistic Scots Confession, although Scots had been forced to somewhat compromise on their ecclesiology. In 1615, the Church of Ireland adopted the explicitly Calvinistic Irish Articles, which had largely been written by James Ussher, later Archbishop of Armagh. Also in Ireland, the settling of the on the northeast part of the island Ulster Plantation by some Scottish Presbyterians led to the establishment of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.\\r\\nIn 1642, the English Civil War broke out between the Parliamentarians and the supporters of King Charles I. In 1643, Parliament, in exchange for the military support from Scottish Covenanters, convened the Westminster Assembly. What resulted from the assembly, which met between 1643 and 1649 were the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Larger & Shorter Catechisms, the Directory for the Publick Worship of God and The Form of Presbyterian Church Government.\\r\\nWhile they were intended to be binding on the entire nation, following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, King Charles II openly supported the Church of England at the exclusion of the Presbyterians. In fact, it wasn't until the 1689 Act of Toleration, in the wake of the Glorious Revolution, that freedom of worship was established in England for non-Anglican Protestants Nevertheless, the Westminster Confession & Catechisms replaced the Scots Confession as the subordinate standards for the Church of Scotland and are the confessional standards of most Presbyterians around the world.\\r\\nIn the second half of the 1630s, Calvinistic Baptists emerged.[53] Eventually, in 1644, they published their own confession, the First London Baptist Confession, with a second edition being published two years later. Meanwhile, in 1653, Congregationalists, borrowing heavily from the Westminster Confession, wrote the Savoy Declaration. Baptists and Congregationalists, along with Presbyterians, faced persecution following the 1660 restoration of the monarchy and the passing of the Conventicle Act of 1664. Following the Glorious Revolution, Calvinistic Baptists issued the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith.\\r\\nThe second reformation was given different names even in different parts of the English-speaking world. These include\\r\\nSome of the articles on the First Reformation also cover the second.\\r\\nIn 1620, the Mayflower arrived at Plymouth with the Pilgrims, most of them who were of a Calvinistic separatist group known as the Brownists. Other Calvinistic Puritans settled in the nearby Massachusetts Bay Colony. Meanwhile, in 1628, an American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church was established by the Dutch colonists in the colony of New Netherland, a church which eventually would become the Reformed Church in America. Meanwhile, Roger Williams established a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island, which had been organized along Calvinist lines.[53] In the 18th century, Calvinistic Baptists would found the Philadelphia Association, eventually adopting a modified version of the 1689 London Baptist Confession in 1742, renaming it the Philadelphia Confession.\\r\\nPresbyterianism would be established in the colonies in 1703, which the establishment of the Presbytery of Philadelphia. In time, two other presbyteries would be formed, constituting a Synod in 1717. In 1729, the Presbyterians would formally adopt the Westminster Confession and Catechisms as their confessional standards. Scottish Churches under the auspices of their churches in the old country would also establish churches in the 18th century, with the Associate Presbytery being established by the Seeders in 1758 and the Covenanters founding the Reformed Presbytery in 1774. Many of the Seceders and Covenanters would merge in 1782 to form the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Other Covenanters would form the Reformed Presbytery, which, in the wake of the \\"Old-Light/New Light\\" Controversy, would split into the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America and the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod. In 1789, the Presbyterians who had been formed in 1703 with the establishment of the first presbytery, formed the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.\\r\\nA version of Calvinism that has been adopted by both theological conservatives and liberals gained influence in the Dutch Reformed churches, late in the 19th century, dubbed \\"neo-Calvinism\\", which developed along lines of the theories of Dutch theologian, statesman and journalist, Abraham Kuyper.\\r\\nAround the beginning of the 21st century, \\"new Calvinism\\" became influential in some evangelical circles, often blending Calvinist soteriology and more Charismatic views of the spiritual gifts. Influential leaders of the movement include John Piper, Mark Driscoll, Al Mohler and Matt Chandler.","input":"Which cities were the center of calvinism and lutheranism?"},{"output":"54 mph","context":"Flight of Fear (previously known as The Outer Limits: Flight of Fear) is an enclosed launched roller coaster at two Cedar Fair parks ÿ Kings Dominion and Kings Island.[1][2] Both locations opened in 1996 and were the world's first roller coasters to feature a linear induction motor (LIM) launch.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKings Dominion began teasing the new attraction in the summer of 1995 by cutting a \\"crop circle\\" in a nearby field which featured a UFO, the face of an alien and the letter \\"F\\" written in binary.[4] Premier Rides and Paramount's Kings Dominion performed the first successful launch of the ride on April 11, 1996 at 5:33 p.m., proving that linear induction motors could be used to accelerate a roller coaster train using magnetic fields with enough force to complete a full circuit.[5] The launch requires 3 megawatts of electric power, which caused frequent voltage sags to neighboring utility customers.

At Kings Island, the ride is located in the X-Base subsection of Coney Mall. For years it was the only ride on the east side of The Racer. With the addition of Firehawk in the 2007, the area took on a theme center on experimental flight and propulsion systems.

The ride emerges into a \\"spaghetti bowl\\" of track inside of the 110-foot tall ride building.[13] Following the launch, the train immediately enters a cobra roll, which contains two of the ride's four inversions. The ride layout continues with a sidewinder and multiple turns. After passing through the mid-course brake run, riders spiral downward to the left, continuing to maneuver through the twisted ride structure. The train picks up speed as riders dive at the floor of the building, finally passing through a corkscrew before arriving at the final brake run.\\r\\nThe trains originally featured over-the-shoulder restraints. For the 2001 season, three of the four trains which came with the ride were converted to use individual ratcheting lap bar restraints instead of the original over-the-shoulder restraints which caused riders to experience significant headbanging.[2] Kings Dominion operates three trains with five cars, while Kings Island runs only two trains with five cars. The ride originally ran with six-car trains.[1][2]\\r\\nThe queue building is designed to represent an Area 51 military installation. The outside of the hangar is marked with the number 18, referencing Hangar 18 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Hangar 18 supposedly stores evidence from the Roswell crash site which serves as a base for the ride's storyline. A UFO was spotted crashing into a field not far from the park and the press along with civilians are now permitted to enter the base to view its contents for themselves.\\r\\nRiders enter the line through a \\"press area\\" located under an awning to the side of the building. Various announcements regarding the operation of the base and broadcasts from WERD (\\"weird\\"), a fictitious radio station, are played over speakers in the outside queue area. The queue leads down a narrow tunnel, entering the hangar. The interior of the hangar contains a full-sized mockup of one-half of a UFO which appears to be complete as one of the walls of the building is completely covered in mirrors. A video is played over multiple screens explaining how the spacecraft was recovered not far from the park. While some base personnel are running tests on the vessel, others are convinced that it is a hoax and decide to allow the press in to view it. The hangar contains lighting effects which are synchronized with the video. At Kings Dominion, much of the interior of the queue building was converted into a space for the \\"Lockdown\\" Halloween Haunt maze, although much of the UFO-related theming remains.[14] The line winds around the inside of the hangar before entering the underside of the UFO up a short flight of stairs.\\r\\nThe inside of the saucer features a display with alien markings and various sound effects. The queue makes a right turn and then sharp left turn into the boarding area. The loading and unloading stations are separate, so riders in the loading side of the building see an empty train returning. The loading station features \\"cryotubes\\" containing mannequins dressed in the park's souvenir clothing and wrapped in plastic to look as if they have been captured by the aliens.\\r\\nWhile the train is loading and waiting to be dispatched, a sound effect imitating a jet engine warming up is played and as the train launches, a take off sound is played.

In 2009, Ulta Beauty partnered with BCRF and in the 10 years since, has raised more than $22 million to support its groundbreaking research. UBCF is among BCRFs top three major donors and is currently helping to fund 16 breast cancer research projects. UBCF partnered with Dress for Success in 2017 to help empower women to achieve economic independence by providing them with professional attire and the resources needed to help them progress their careers. Ulta Beauty provides financial support, products and valuable time to local nonprofit organizations, especially in relation to family and child care, and many leaders serve on the board of various nonprofits organizations.

Lagos was annexed on 6 August 1861 under the threat of force by Commander Beddingfield of HMS Prometheus who was accompanied by the Acting British Consul, William McCoskry. Oba Dosunmu of Lagos (spelled \\"Docemo\\" in British documents) resisted the cession for 11 days while facing the threat of violence on Lagos and its people, but capitulated and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession.[1] Lagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862.[2]\\r\\nBy 1872 Lagos was a cosmopolitan trading center with a population over 60,000.[3]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of prolonged wars between the mainland Yoruba states, the colony established a protectorate over most of Yorubaland between 1890 and 1897.[4] The colony and protectorate were incorporated into Southern Nigeria in February 1906, and Lagos became the capital of the protectorate of Nigeria in January 1914.[2]\\r\\nSince then, Lagos has grown to become the largest city in West Africa, with an estimated metropolitan population of over 9,000,000 as of 2011.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLagos was originally a fishing community on the north of Lagos Island, which lies in Lagos Lagoon, a large protected harbour on the Atlantic coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea west of the Niger River delta. The Lagoon is protected from the ocean by long sand spits that run east and west for up to 100 kilometres (62?mi) in both directions.[6]\\r\\nLagos has a tropical savanna climate with two rainy seasons. The heaviest rains fall from April to July and there is a weaker rainy season in October and November. Total annual rainfall is 1,900 millimetres (75?in). Average temperatures range from 25?C (77?F) in July to 29?C (84?F) in March.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years the staple products of the region were palm oil and palm kernels. Manufacture of palm oil was mainly considered a job for women.[8] Later exports included copra made from the coconut palm, guinea grains, gum copal, camwood and sesame (benne).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest incarnation of Lagos was an Awori Yoruba fishing community located on the islands and peninsula that form the modern state.[10] The area was inhabited by families who claimed a semi-mythical ancestry from a figure called Olofin.[11] The modern descendants of this figure are the contemporary nobility known as the Idejo or \\"white cap chiefs\\" of Lagos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 16th century, Lagos island was sacked and colonized by troops of the Oba of Benin during that kingdom's expansionary phase. They established a war camp in the town, and it became known as Eko. In the 17th century it became an important port town in the Benin Empire. The monarchs of Lagos since then have claimed descent from the warrior Ashipa[12] who is sometimes said to have been a prince of Benin or, sometimes, an Awori freebooter loyal to the Benin throne. The Idejo aristocracy remained Yoruba. Ashipa's son built his palace on Lagos Island, and his grandson moved the seat of government to the palace from the Iddo peninsula. In 1730 the Oba of Lagos invited Portuguese slave traders to the island, where soon a flourishing trade developed.[13] 18th century Lagos was still technically a vassal city-state within the Benin Empire, but was increasingly independent and surpassing the latter in power and influence as Benin's power waned.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first half of the 19th century the Yoruba hinterland was in a state of near-constant warfare due to internal conflicts and incursions from the northern and western neighbouring states. By then the fortified island of Lagos had become a major centre of the slave trade. The United Kingdom abolished import of slaves to their colonies in 1807, and abolished slavery in all British territories in 1833. The British became increasingly active in suppressing the slave trade.[15] At the end of 1851 a naval expedition bombarded Lagos into submission,[16] deposed Oba Kosoko, installed the more amenable Oba Akitoye, and signed the Great Britain-Lagos treaty that made slavery illegal in Lagos on January 1, 1852. A few months later Louis Fraser  from the Bight of Benin consulate was posted to the island as vice-Consul. The next year Lagos was upgraded to a full consulate with Benjamin Campbell appointed as Consul.[17][15]\\r\\nA Yoruba emigrant, the catechist James White, wrote in 1853 \\"By the taking of Lagos, England has performed an act which the grateful children of Africa shall long remember ... One of the principal roots of the slave trade is torn out of the soil\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nTensions between the new ruler, Akitoye, and supporters of the deposed Kosoko led to fighting in August 1853. An attempt by Kosoko himself to take the town was defeated, but Akitoye died suddenly on 2 September 1853, perhaps by poison. After consulting with the local chiefs, the consul declared Dosunmu (Docemo), the eldest son of Akitoye, the new Oba.[19] With succeeding crises and interventions, the consulate evolved over the following years into a form of protectorate.[15] Lagos became a base from which the British gradually extended their jurisdiction, in the form of a protectorate, over the hinterland. The process was driven by the demands of trade and security rather than by any deliberate policy of expansion.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CMS Grammar School was founded in Lagos on 6 June 1859 by the Church Missionary Society, modelled on the CMS Grammar School in Freetown, Sierra Leone.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1861 a British naval force entered Lagos and annexed Lagos as a British colony via the Lagos Treaty of Cession. King Dosunmu's powers were significantly reduced and consul William McCoskry became acting governor.[22][fn 1] As a colony, Lagos was now protected and governed directly from Britain.[24] Africans born in the colony were British subjects, with full rights including access to the courts. By contrast, Africans in the later protectorates of southern and northern Nigeria were protected people but remained under the jurisdiction of their traditional rulers.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years, trade with the interior was severely restricted due to a war between Ibadan and Abeokuta. The Ogun River leading to Abeokuta was not safe for canoe traffic, with travellers at risk from Egba robbers. On 14 November 1862 Governor Henry Stanhope Freeman called on all British subjects to return from Abeokuta to Lagos, leaving their property, for which the chiefs of Abeokuta would be answerable to the British government.[26] Acting Governor William Rice Mulliner met the Bashorun of Abeokuta in May 1863, who told him that recent robberies of traders' property were due to the custom of suppressing trading so as to force the men to war. The plunder would cease when the war was over. In the meantime, traders should not travel to Abeokuta since their safety could not be guaranteed.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the slave trade had been suppressed, and slavery was illegal in British territory, slavery still continued in the region. Lagos was seen as a haven by runaway slaves, who were something of a problem for the administration. McCoskry set up a court to hear cases of abuse against slaves and of runaway slaves from the interior, and established a \\"Liberated African Yard\\" to give employment to freed runaways until they were able to look after themselves. He did not consider that abolition of slavery in the colony would be practical.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCoskry, and other merchants in the colony, opposed the activities of missionaries, which they felt interfered with trade. In 1855 McCloskry had been among signatories of a petition to prevent two missionaries who had gone on leave from returning to Lagos. McCloskry communicated his view to the former explorer Richard Francis Burton, who visited Lagos and Abeokuta in 1861 while acting as consul at Fernando Po, and who was also opposed to missionary work.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeman, his successor, agreed with Burton that the blacks were more likely to be converted by Islam than by Christianity.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeman attempted to prevent Robert Campbell, a Jamaican of part-Scottish, part-African descent, from establishing a newspaper in the colony. He considered it would be \\"a dangerous instrument in the hands of semi-civilized Negroes\\". The British government did not agree, and the first issue of the Anglo-African, appeared on 6 June 1863.[31] Earlier, in 1854, there had been a newspaper that can truly be described as the first Nigerian newspaper called Iwe Iroyin Yoruba fun awon Egba ati Yoruba.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small legislative council was established when the colony was founded in 1861, with the mandate of assisting and advising the Governor but without formal authority, and was maintained until 1922. The majority of members were colonial officials.[32]\\r\\nIn 1863 the British established the Lagos Town Improvement Ordinance, aiming to control physical development of the town and surrounding territory.[24]\\r\\nThe administration was merged with that of Sierra Leone in 1866, and was transferred to the Gold Coast in 1874.\\r\\nThe Lagos elites lobbied intensively to have autonomy restored, which did not happen until 1886.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nColonial Lagos developed into a busy, cosmopolitan port, with an architecture that blended Victorian and Brazilian styles.[7]\\r\\nThe Brazilian element was imparted by skilled builders and masons who had returned from Brazil.[34]\\r\\nThe black elite was composed of English-speaking \\"Saros\\" from Sierra Leone and other emancipated slaves who had been repatriated from Brazil and Cuba.[7]\\r\\nBy 1872 the population of the colony was over 60,000, of whom less than 100 were of European origin. In 1876 imports were valued at S476,813 and exports at S619,260.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 January 1874, leaders of the Methodist community, including Charles Joseph George, met to discuss founding a secondary school for members of their communion as an alternative to the CMS Grammar School. After a fund-raising drive, the Methodist Boys School building was opened in June 1877.[35]\\r\\nOn 17 February 1881, George was one of the community leaders who laid the foundation stone for the Wesley Church at Olowogbowo, in the west of Lagos Island.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colony had largely succeeded in eliminating slavery and had become a prosperous trading community, but until the start of the European scramble for Africa the British Imperial government considered that the Lagos colony in some respects a failure. The British had refused to intervene in the politics of the hinterland and cut-throat competition among British and French firms along the Niger had kept it from returning any significant profit.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1877 a trade war broke out between Ibadan and both Egba Alake (Abeokuta) and Ijebu. Further to the east, the Ekiti and Ijesa revolted against Ibadan rule in 1878, and sporadic fighting continued for the next sixteen years. Assistance from Saro merchants in Lagos in the form of breech-loading rifles gave the Ekiti the advantage. The Lagos government, at that time subordinate to Accra in the Gold Coast, was instructed to stay out of the conflict, despite the damage it was doing to trade, and attempts to mediate by the Saro merchants and by the Fulani emirs were rejected.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1884, George Goldie's United African Company had succeeded in absorbing all of his competition and eliminated the French posts from the lower Niger; the situation permitted Britain to claim the entire region at the Berlin Conference the next year. In 1886 Lagos became a separate colony from the Gold Coast under Governor Cornelius Alfred Moloney. The legislative council of the new colony was composed of four official and three unofficial members. Governor Moloney nominated two Africans as unofficial representatives: the clergyman, later bishop James Johnson and the trader Charles Joseph George.[37] At this time the European powers were in intense competition for African colonies while the protagonists in the Yoruba wars were wearying. The Lagos administration, acting through Samuel Johnson and Charles Phillips of the Church Mission Society, arranged a ceasefire and then a treaty that guaranteed the independence of the Ekiti towns. Ilorin refused to cease fighting however, and the war dragged on.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerned about the growing influence of the French in nearby Dahomey, the British established a post at Ilaro in 1890.[4]\\r\\nOn 13 August 1891 a treaty was signed placing the kingdom of Ilaro under the protection of the British queen.[38]\\r\\nWhen Governor Gilbert Thomas Carter arrived in 1891, he followed an aggressive policy. In 1892 he attacked Ijebu, and in 1893 made a tour of Yorubaland signing treaties, forcing the armies to disperse, and opening the way for construction of a railway from Lagos to Ibadan.[4]\\r\\nThus on 3 February 1893, Carter signed a treaty of protection with the Alafin of Oyo and on 15 August 1893, acting Governor George Chardin Denton signed a protectorate agreement with Ibadan.[39]\\r\\nColonial control was firmly established throughout the region after the bombardment of Oyo in 1895 and the capture of Ilorin by the Royal Niger Company in 1897.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1887 Captain Maloney, the Governor, gave a report to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in which he outlined plans for a Botanic Station at Lagos with the purpose of developing indigenous trees and plants that had commercial value.[9]\\r\\nBy 1889 rubber had been introduced to the colony, and was promising excellent yields and quality. A report that year described other products including gum and coconut oil, for which a small-scale crushing business had promise, various fibres, camwood, borwood and Indigo, also seen as having large potential.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growth of the city of Lagos was largely unplanned, impeded by the complex of swamps, canals and sand spits.[41]\\r\\nWilliam MacGregor, governor from 1898 to 1903, instituted a campaign against the prevalent malaria, draining the swamps and destroying as far as possible the mosquitoes that were responsible for the spread of the disease.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nTelephone links with Britain were established by 1886, and electric street lighting in 1898.[34] In August 1896, Charles Joseph George and G.W. Neville, both merchants and both unofficial members of the Legislative Council, presented a petition urging construction of the railway terminus on Lagos Island rather than at Iddo, and also asking for the railway to be extended to Abeokuta. George was the leader of the delegation making this request, and described its many commercial advantages.[43] A major strike broke out in the colony in 1897, which has been described as the \\"first major labour protest\\" in African history.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 February 1899 the Alake of the Egba signed an agreement opening the way for construction of a railway through their territory,\\r\\n[45] and the new railway from Aro to Abeokuta was opened by the Governor in December 1901, in the presence of the Alake.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901 the first qualified African lawyer in the colony, Christopher Sapara Williams, was nominated to the Legislative Council, serving as a member until his death in 1915.[47]\\r\\nIn 1903 there was a crisis over the payment of the tolls that were collected from traders by native rulers, although Europeans were exempted. The alternative was to replace the tolls by a subsidy. MacGregor requested views from Williams, Charles Joseph George and Obadiah Johnson as indigenous opinion leaders. All were in favour of retaining the tolls to avoid upsetting the rulers.[48]\\r\\nIn 1903 Governor MacGregor's administration prepared a Newspaper Ordinance ostensibly designed to prevent libels being published. George, Williams and Johnson, the three Nigerian council members, all objected on the grounds that the ordinance would inhibit freedom of the press. George said \\"any obstacle in the way of publication of newspapers in this colony means throwing Lagos back to its position forty or fifty years ago\\". Despite these objections, the ordinance was passed into law.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalter Egerton was the last Governor of Lagos Colony, appointed in 1903.\\r\\nEgerton enthusiastically endorsed the extension of the Lagos ÿ Ibadan railway onward to Oshogbo, and the project was approved in November 1904. Construction began in January 1905 and the line reached Oshogbo in April 1907.[50]\\r\\nThe colonial office wanted to amalgamate the Lagos Colony with the protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and in August 1904 also appointed Egerton as High Commissioner for the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. He held both offices until 28 February 1906.[51]\\r\\nOn that date the two territories were amalgamated, with the combined territory called the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. In 1914, the Governor-General Sir Frederick Lugard amalgamated this territory with the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nLagos was the capital of Nigeria until 1991, when that role was ceded to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and remains the commercial capital.[34]\\r\\nThe estimated population in 2011 was over 9 million.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernors of the Lagos Colony were as follows:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1866 to 1886 Lagos was subordinate first to Sierra Leone, then to Gold Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: List of schools in Lagos\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: List of hospitals in Lagos\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: Architecture of Lagos","input":"When did lagos become a colony of britain?"},{"output":"Lex Luger","context":"The WWE United States Championship is a professional wrestling championship contested in the American promotion WWE on the SmackDown brand.

This was the result of a four-year planning period spearheaded by Charlotte businessman Earl Patterson Hall, who was inspired to build the park by a 1956 trip to Disneyland and a dream of bringing the two states closer together. Owned and operated by Cedar Fair, Carowinds also features a 27-acre (81,000 m2) water park, Carolina Harbor, which is included with park admission.

Hall and the other stockholders of the Carowinds Corporation continued to operate the theme park through 1974, though sagging attendance and mounting debt forced the company to sell to Taft Broadcasting in early 1975.

SCarowinds is presented on select nights in September and October, as well as the first weekend in November. The park is open with The Great Pumpkin Fest starring Snoopy and rest of the Peanuts gang throughout the day, typically closes at 5:30pm, and reopens as SCarowinds at 7pm with the evil witch and SCarowinds' 1st lady of terror Lilith.[10] The experience includes numerous haunted attractions and incorporates most of the existing park rides into a nightmarish experience. The SCarowinds Halloween Haunt is recommended for ages 13 and up, but any age is permitted for admission.\\r\\nThe Paladium is an outdoor amphitheater located at Carowinds. It opened in 1975 and was the Charlotte area's premier outdoor concert venue until the opening of Blockbuster Pavilion, now PNC Music Pavilion, in 1991. Admission to the Paladium is separate from admission to Carowinds. In 1992, the Paladium hosted Chapel Hill's James Taylor. It had Virginia's Dave Matthews Band in '93, UK's Depeche Mode in '94, Athens GA's B-52's in '94, Johnny Cash in '95, Billy Ray Cyrus in '95, Blues Traveler in '96, UK's Duran Duran in 2000, Weird Al Yankovic in '00, Atlanta Christian rapper Lecrae in 2014 (for Rock the Park), and Skillet in 2015.\\r\\nFast Lane is a limited-access line queue system offered for an additional charge at Cedar Fair amusement parks. Visitors can purchase access, which includes a wristband that allows them to bypass standard lines in favor of shorter ones at many of the parks' most popular attractions. Fast Lane Plus is a more expensive, higher-end version that includes several additional attractions.[11]\\r\\nThe annual Carowinds Festival of Music allows music students to play in public performances and receive comments and ratings from nationally recognized adjudicators. Bands, choirs, show choirs, and orchestras can all play for ratings. Plaques and ribbons are awarded for performances which receive ratings of superior and excellent.[12]","input":"What amusement park is in charlotte north carolina?"},{"output":"Lake Baikal","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal (/ba??k?l, -?k?l/;[4] Russian: ?Ѿ ?, tr. Ozero Baykal, IPA:?[?oz??r? b?j?ka?]; Buryat:  , Baigal nuur; Mongolian:  , Baigal nuur, etymologically meaning, in Mongolian, \\"the Nature Lake\\")[5] is a rift lake in Russia, located in southern Siberia, between Irkutsk Oblast to the northwest and the Buryat Republic to the southeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake by volume in the world, containing 22ÿ23% of the world's fresh surface water.[3][6][7] With 23,615.39?km3 (5,670?cu?mi) of fresh water,[1] it contains more water than the North American Great Lakes combined.[8] With a maximum depth of 1,642?m (5,387?ft),[1] Baikal is the world's deepest lake.[9] It is considered among the world's clearest[10] lakes and is considered the world's oldest lake[11] ÿ at 25ÿ30 million years.[12][13] It is the seventh-largest lake in the world by surface area.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Lake Tanganyika, Lake Baikal was formed as an ancient rift valley, having the typical long, crescent shape with a surface area of 31,722?km2 (12,248?sq?mi). Baikal is home to thousands of species of plants and animals, many of which exist nowhere else in the world. The lake was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.[14] It is also home to Buryat tribes who reside on the eastern side of Lake Baikal,[15][16] raising goats, camels, cattle, sheep, and horses,[16] where the mean temperature varies from a winter minimum of ?19?C (?2?F) to a summer maximum of 14?C (57?F).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region to the east of Lake Baikal is referred to as Transbaikalia, and the loosely defined region around the lake is sometimes known as simply Baikalia.\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal is in a rift valley, created by the Baikal Rift Zone, where the Earth's crust is slowly pulling apart.[18] At 636?km (395?mi) long and 79?km (49?mi) wide, Lake Baikal has the largest surface area of any freshwater lake in Asia, at 31,722?km2 (12,248?sq?mi), and is the deepest lake in the world at 1,642?m (5,387?ft). The bottom of the lake is 1,186.5?m (3,893?ft) below sea level, but below this lies some 7?km (4.3?mi) of sediment, placing the rift floor some 8ÿ11?km (5.0ÿ6.8?mi) below the surface, the deepest continental rift on Earth.[18] In geological terms, the rift is young and active ÿ it widens about 2?cm (0.8?in) per year. The fault zone is also seismically active; hot springs occur in the area and notable earthquakes happen every few years. The lake is divided into three basins: North, Central, and South, with depths about 900?m (3,000?ft), 1,600?m (5,200?ft), and 1,400?m (4,600?ft), respectively. Fault-controlled accommodation zones rising to depths about 300?m (980?ft) separate the basins. The North and Central basins are separated by Academician Ridge, while the area around the Selenga Delta and the Buguldeika Saddle separates the Central and South basins. The lake drains into the Angara tributary of the Yenisei. Notable landforms include Cape Ryty on Baikal's northwest coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaikal's age is estimated at 25ÿ30 million years, making it the most ancient lake in geological history.[12][13] It is unique among large, high-latitude lakes, as its sediments have not been scoured by overriding continental ice sheets. Russian, U.S., and Japanese cooperative studies of deep-drilling core sediments in the 1990s provide a detailed record of climatic variation over the past 6.7 million years.[19][20] Longer and deeper sediment cores are expected in the near future. Lake Baikal is the only confined freshwater lake in which direct and indirect evidence of gas hydrates exists.[21][22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lake is completely surrounded by mountains. The Baikal Mountains on the north shore, the Barguzin Range on the northeastern shore, and the taiga are technically protected as a national park. It contains 27 islands; the largest, Olkhon, is 72?km (45?mi) long and is the third-largest lake-bound island in the world. The lake is fed by as many as 330 inflowing rivers.[24] The main ones draining directly into Baikal are the Selenga River, the Barguzin River, the Upper Angara River, the Turka River, the Sarma River, and the Snezhnaya River. It is drained through a single outlet, the Angara River.\\r\\n\\r\\nCliffs on Olkhon Island\\r\\n\\r\\nA sandy beach in the Kabansky District\\r\\n\\r\\nMountains on the Svyatoy Nos Peninsula, Zabaykalsky National Park\\r\\n\\r\\nTurka River at its mouth before joining Lake Baikal\\r\\n\\r\\nBaikal is one of the clearest lakes in the world.[10] During the winter in open sections the water transparency can be as much as 30ÿ40?m (98ÿ131?ft), but during the summer it is typically 5ÿ8?m (16ÿ26?ft).[25] Baikal is rich in oxygen, even in deep sections,[25] which separates it from the distinctly stratified bodies of water such as Lake Tanganyika and the Black Sea.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Lake Baikal, the water temperature varies significantly depending on location, depth, and time of the year. During the winter and spring, the surface freezes for 4ÿ5 months; from early January to MayÿJune (latest in the north), the entire lake surface is covered in ice.[28] On average, the ice reaches a thickness of 0.5?to 1.4?m (1.6ÿ4.6?ft),[29] but in some places with hummocks, it can be more than 2?m (6.6?ft).[28] During this period, the temperature slowly increases with depth in the lake, being coldest near the ice-covered surface at around freezing, and reaching about 3.5ÿ3.8?C (38.3ÿ38.8?F) at a depth of 200ÿ250?m (660ÿ820?ft).[30] After the surface ice breaks up, the surface water is slowly warmed up by the sun, and in MayÿJune, the upper circa 300?m (980?ft) becomes homothermic (same temperature throughout) at around 4?C (39?F) because of water mixing.[25][30] The sun continues to heat up the surface layer, and at the peak in August can reach up to about 16?C (61?F) in the main sections[30] and 20ÿ24?C (68ÿ75?F) in shallow bays in the southern half of the lake.[25][31] During this time, the pattern is inverted compared to the winter and spring, as the water temperature falls with increasing depth. As the autumn begins, the surface temperature falls again and a second homothermic period at around 4?C (39?F) of the upper circa 300?m (980?ft) occurs in OctoberÿNovember.[25][30] In the deepest parts of the lake, from about 300?m (980?ft), the temperature is very stable at 3.1ÿ3.4?C (37.6ÿ38.1?F) with only minor annual variations.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average surface temperature has risen by almost 1.5 C (2.7 F) in the last 50 years, resulting in a shorter period where the lake is covered by ice.[13] At some locations, hydrothermal vents with water that can be about 50?C (122?F) have been found. These are mostly in deep water, but locally have also been found in relatively shallow water. They have very little effect on the lake's temperature because of its huge volume.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nStormy weather on the lake is common, especially during the summer and fall, and can result in waves as high as 4.5?m (15?ft).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal as seen from the OrbView-2 satellite\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring ice melt underway on Lake Baikal, on 4 May: Notice the ice-covered north, while much of the south already is ice-free.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircle of thin ice, diameter of 4.4?km (2.7?mi) at the lake's southern tip, probably caused by convection\\r\\n\\r\\nDelta of the Selenga River, Baikal's main tributary\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal is rich in biodiversity. It hosts more than 1,000 species of plants and 2,500 species of animals based on current knowledge, but the actual figures for both groups are believed to be significantly higher.[25][32] More than 80% of the animals are endemic.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watershed of Lake Baikal have numerous floral species represented. The marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre) is found here at the eastern limit of its geographic range.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubmerged macrophytic vascular plants are mostly absent, except in some shallow bays along the shores of Lake Baikal.[34] More than 85 species of submerged macrophytes have been recorded, including genera such as Ceratophyllum, Myriophyllum, Potamogeton, and Sparganium.[31] The invasive species Elodea canadensis was introduced to the lake in the 1950s.[34] Instead of vascular plants, aquatic flora is often dominated by several green algae species, notably Draparnaldioides, Tetraspora, and Ulothrix in water shallower than 20?m (65?ft); although Aegagrophila, Cladophora, and Draparnaldioides may occur deeper than 30?m (100?ft).[34] Except for Ulothrix, there are endemic Baikal species in all these green algae genera.[34] More than 400 diatom species, both benthic and planktonic, are found in the lake, and about half of these are endemic to Baikal; however, significant taxonomic uncertainties remain for this group.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baikal seal or nerpa (Pusa sibirica) is found throughout Lake Baikal.[35] It is one of only three entirely freshwater seal populations in the world, the other two being subspecies of ringed seals.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wide range of land mammals can be found in the habitats around the lake, such as Eurasian brown bear, Eurasian wolf, red fox, sable, stoat, elk, Siberian red deer, reindeer, Siberian roe deer, Siberian musk deer, wild boar, red squirrel, Siberian chipmunk, marmot, lemming, and Alpine hare.[36] Until the Early Middle Ages, the wisent (European bison) was present near the lake, which was the easternmost part of its range.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 236 species of birds that inhabit Lake Baikal, 29 of which are waterfowl.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nFewer than 65 native fish species occur in the lake basin, but more than half of these are endemic.[25][41] The families Abyssocottidae (deep-water sculpins), Comephoridae (golomyankas or Baikal oilfish), and Cottocomephoridae (Baikal sculpins) are entirely restricted to the lake basin.[25][42] All these are part of the Cottoidea and are typically less than 20?cm (8?in) long.[34] Of particular note are the two species of golomyanka (Comephorus baicalensis and C. dybowskii). These long-finned, translucent fish typically live in open water at depths of 100ÿ500?m (330ÿ1,640?ft), but occur both shallower and much deeper. Together with certain abyssocottid sculpins, they are the deepest living freshwater fish in the world, occurring to near the bottom of Lake Baikal.[43] The golomyankas are the primary prey of the Baikal seal and represent the largest fish biomass in the lake.[44] Beyond members of Cottoidea, there are few endemic fish species in the lake basin.[25][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important local species for fisheries is the omul (Coregonus migratorius), an endemic whitefish.[25] It is caught, smoked, and then sold widely in markets around the lake. Also, a second endemic whitefish inhabits the lake, C. baicalensis.[45] The Baikal black grayling (Thymallus baicalensis), Baikal white grayling (T. brevipinnis), and Baikal sturgeon (Acipenser baerii baicalensis) are other important species with commercial value. They are also endemic to the Lake Baikal basin.[39][40][46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lake hosts a rich endemic fauna of invertebrates. The copepod Epischura baikalensis is endemic to Lake Baikal and the dominating zooplankton species there, making up 80 to 90% of total biomass.[48] It is estimated that the epischurans filter as much as a thousand cubic kilometers of water a year, or the lakes entire volume every twenty-three years.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most diverse invertebrate groups are the amphipod and ostracod crustaceans, freshwater snails, annelid worms and turbellarian worms:\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 350 species and subspecies of amphipods are endemic to the lake.[32] They are exceptionally diverse in ecology and appearance, ranging from the pelagic Macrohectopus to the relatively large deep-water Abyssogammarus and Garjajewia, the tiny herbivorous Micruropus, and the parasitic Pachyschesis (parasitic on other amphipods).[50] The \\"gigantism\\" of some Baikal amphipods, which has been compared to that seen in Antarctic amphipods, has been linked to the high level of dissolved oxygen in the lake.[51] Among the \\"giants\\" are several species of spiny Acanthogammarus and Brachyuropus (Acanthogammaridae) found at both shallow and deep depths.[52] These conspicuous and common amphipods are essentially carnivores (will also take detritus), and can reach a body length up to 7?cm (2.8?in).[50][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to another ancient lake, Tanganyika, Baikal is a center for ostracod diversity. About 90% of the Lake Baikal ostracods are endemic,[53] meaning that there are c. 200 endemic species.[54] This makes it the second-most diverse group of crustacean in the lake, after the amphipods.[53] The vast majority of the Baikal ostracods belong in the families Candonidae (more than 100 described species) and Cytherideidae (about 50 described species),[53][55] but genetic studies indicate that the true diversity in at least the latter family has been heavily underestimated.[56] The morphology of the Baikal ostracods is highly diverse.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2006[update], almost 150 freshwater snails are known from Lake Baikal, including 117 endemic species from the subfamilies Baicaliinae (part of the Amnicolidae) and Benedictiinae (part of the Lithoglyphidae), and the families Planorbidae and Valvatidae.[57] All endemics have been recorded between 20 and 30?m (66 and 98?ft), but the majority mainly live at shallower depths.[57] About 30 freshwater snail species can be seen deeper than 100?m (330?ft), which represents the approximate limit of the sunlight zone, but only 10 are truly deepwater species.[57] In general, Baikal snails are thin-shelled and small. Two of the most common species are Benedictia baicalensis and Megalovalvata baicalensis.[58] Bivalve diversity is lower with more than 30 species; about half of these, all in the families Euglesidae, Pisidiidae, and Sphaeriidae, are endemic (the only other family in the lake is the Unionidae with a single nonendemic species).[58][59] The endemic bivalves are mainly found in shallows, with few species from deep water.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith almost 200 described species, including more than 160 endemics, the center of diversity for aquatic freshwater oligochaetes is Lake Baikal.[61] A smaller number of other freshwater annelids is known: 30 species of leeches (Hirudinea),[62] and 4 polychaetes.[61] Several hundred species of nematodes are known from the lake, but a large percentage of these are undescribed.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 140 endemic flatworm (Plathelminthes) species are in Lake Baikal, where they occur on a wide range of bottom types.[63] Most of the flatworms are predatory, and some are relatively brightly marked. They are often very abundant in shallow waters, where they are typically less than 2?cm (1?in) long, but in deeper parts of the lake, the largest, Baikaloplana valida, can reach up to 30?cm (1?ft) when outstretched.[34][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least 18 species of sponges occur in the lake,[64] including 14 species from the endemic family Lubomirskiidae (the remaining are from the nonendemic family Spongillidae).[65] In the nearshore regions of Baikal, the largest benthic biomass is sponges.[64] Lubomirskia baicalensis, Baikalospongia bacillifera, and B. intermedia are unusually large for freshwater sponges and can reach 1?m (3.3?ft) or more.[64][66] These three are also the most common sponges in the lake.[64] While the Baikalospongia species typically have encrusting or carpet-like structures, L. baikalensis often has branching structures and in areas where common may form underwater \\"forests\\".[67] Most sponges in the lake are typically green when alive because of symbiotic chlorophytes (zoochlorella), but can also be brownish or yellowish.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baikal area, sometimes known as Baikalia, has a long history of human habitation. An early known tribe in the area was the Kurykans.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in the former northern territory of the Xiongnu confederation, Lake Baikal is one site of the HanÿXiongnu War, where the armies of the Han dynasty pursued and defeated the Xiongnu forces from the second century BC to the first century AD. They recorded that the lake was a \\"huge sea\\" (hanhai) and designated it the North Sea (BihҊi) of the semimythical Four Seas.[69] The Kurykans, a Siberian tribe who inhabited the area in the sixth century, gave it a name that translates to \\"much water\\". Later on, it was called \\"natural lake\\" (Baygal nuur) by the Buryats and \\"rich lake\\" (Bay g?l) by the Yakuts.[70] Little was known to Europeans about the lake until Russia expanded into the area in the 17th century. The first Russian explorer to reach Lake Baikal was Kurbat Ivanov in 1643.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian expansion into the Buryat area around Lake Baikal[72] in 1628ÿ58 was part of the Russian conquest of Siberia. It was done first by following the Angara River upstream from Yeniseysk (founded 1619) and later by moving south from the Lena River. Russians first heard of the Buryats in 1609 at Tomsk. According to folktales related a century after the fact, in 1623, Demid Pyanda, who may have been the first Russian to reach the Lena, crossed from the upper Lena to the Angara and arrived at Yeniseysk.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nVikhor Savin (1624) and Maksim Perfilyev (1626 and 1627ÿ28) explored Tungus country on the lower Angara. To the west, Krasnoyarsk on the upper Yenisei was founded in 1627. A number of ill-documented expeditions explored eastward from Krasnoyarsk. In 1628, Pyotr Beketov first encountered a group of Buryats and collected yasak (tribute) from them at the future site of Bratsk. In 1629, Yakov Khripunov set off from Tomsk to find a rumored silver mine. His men soon began plundering both Russians and natives. They were joined by another band of rioters from Krasnoyarsk, but left the Buryat country when they ran short of food. This made it difficult for other Russians to enter the area. In 1631, Maksim Perfilyev built an ostrog at Bratsk. The pacification was moderately successful, but in 1634, Bratsk was destroyed and its garrison killed. In 1635, Bratsk was restored by a punitive expedition under Radukovskii. In 1638, it was besieged unsuccessfully.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1638, Perfilyev crossed from the Angara over the Ilim portage to the Lena River and went downstream as far as Olyokminsk. Returning, he sailed up the Vitim River into the area east of Lake Baikal (1640) where he heard reports of the Amur country. In 1641, Verkholensk was founded on the upper Lena. In 1643, Kurbat Ivanov went further up the Lena and became the first Russian to see Lake Baikal and Olkhon Island. Half his party under Skorokhodov remained on the lake, reached the Upper Angara at its northern tip, and wintered on the Barguzin River on the northeast side.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1644, Ivan Pokhabov went up the Angara to Baikal, becoming perhaps the first Russian to use this route, which is difficult because of the rapids. He crossed the lake and explored the lower Selenge River. About 1647, he repeated the trip, obtained guides, and visited a 'Tsetsen Khan' near Ulan Bator. In 1648, Ivan Galkin built an ostrog on the Barguzin River which became a center for eastward expansion. In 1652, Vasily Kolesnikov reported from Barguzin that one could reach the Amur country by following the Selenga, Uda, and Khilok Rivers to the future sites of Chita and Nerchinsk. In 1653, Pyotr Beketov took Kolesnikov's route to Lake Irgen west of Chita, and that winter his man Urasov founded Nerchinsk. Next spring, he tried to occupy Nerchensk, but was forced by his men to join Stephanov on the Amur. Nerchinsk was destroyed by the local Tungus, but restored in 1658.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway was built between 1896 and 1902. Construction of the scenic railway around the southwestern end of Lake Baikal required 200 bridges and 33 tunnels. Until its completion, a train ferry transported railcars across the lake from Port Baikal to Mysovaya for a number of years. The lake became the site of the minor engagement between the Czechoslovak legion and the Red Army in 1918. At times during winter freezes, the lake could be crossed on foot, though at risk of frostbite and deadly hypothermia from the cold wind moving unobstructed across flat expanses of ice. In the winter of 1920, the Great Siberian Ice March occurred, when the retreating White Russian Army crossed frozen Lake Baikal. The wind on the exposed lake was so cold, many people died, freezing in place until spring thaw. Beginning in 1956, the impounding of the Irkutsk Dam on the Angara River raised the level of the lake by 1.4?m (4.6?ft).[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the railway was built, a large hydrogeographical expedition headed by F.K. Drizhenko produced the first detailed contour map of the lake bed.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuryat shaman on Olkhon Island\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian map circa 1700, Baikal (not to scale) is at top\\r\\n\\r\\nSteam locomotive on the Circum-Baikal Railroad\\r\\n\\r\\nAngara?(ru) was launched in 1900 and is one of the oldest surviving icebreakers\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral organizations are carrying out natural research projects on Lake Baikal. Most of them are governmental or associated with governmental organizations. The Baikalian Research Centre is an independent research organization carrying out environmental educational and research projects at Lake Baikal.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2008, Russia sent two small submersibles, Mir-1 and Mir-2, to descend 1,592?m (5,223?ft) to the bottom of Lake Baikal to conduct geological and biological tests on its unique ecosystem. Although originally reported as being successful, they did not set a world record for the deepest freshwater dive, reaching a depth of only 1,580?m (5,180?ft).[76] That record is currently held by Anatoly Sagalevich, at 1,637?m (5,371?ft) (also in Lake Baikal aboard a Pisces submersible in 1990).[76][77] Russian scientist and federal politician Artur Chilingarov, the leader of the mission, took part in the Mir dives[78] as did Russian leader Vladimir Putin.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1993, neutrino research has been conducted at the Baikal Deep Underwater Neutrino Telescope (BDUNT). The Baikal Neutrino Telescope NT-200 is being deployed in Lake Baikal, 3.6?km (2.2?mi) from shore at a depth of 1.1?km (0.68?mi). It consists of 192 optical modules.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lake, nicknamed \\"the Pearl of Siberia\\", drew investors from the tourist industry as energy revenues sparked an economic boom.[81] Viktor Grigorov's Grand Baikal in Irkutsk is one of the investors, who planned to build three hotels, creating 570 jobs. In 2007, the Russian government declared the Baikal region a special economic zone. A popular resort in Listvyanka is home to the seven-story Hotel Mayak. At the northern part of the lake, Baikalplan (a German NGO) built together with Russians in 2009 the Frolikha Adventure Coastline Track, a 100?km (62?mi)-long long-distance trail as example for a sustainable development of the region. Baikal was also declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996. Rosatom plans to build a laboratory near Baikal, in conjunction with an international uranium plant and to invest $2.5 billion in the region and create 2,000 jobs in the city of Angarsk.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal is a popular destination among tourists from all over the world. According to the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, in 2013, 79,179 foreign tourists visited Irkutsk and Lake Baikal; in 2014, 146,937 visitors. The most popular places to stay by the lake are Listvyanka village, Olkhon Island, Kotelnikovsky cape, Baykalskiy Priboi, resort Khakusy and Turka village. The popularity of Lake Baikal is growing from year to year, but there is no developed infrastructure in the area. For the quality of service and comfort from the visitor's point of view, Lake Baikal still has a long way to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ice road to Olkhon Island is the only legal ice road on Lake Baikal. The route is prepared by specialists every year and it opens when the ice conditions allow it. In 2015, the ice road to Olkhon was open from February 17 to March 23. The thickness of the ice on the road is about 60?cm (24?in), maximum capacity allowed ÿ 10?t (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons); it is open to the public from 9 am to 6 pm. The road through the lake is 12?km (7.5?mi) long and it goes from the village Kurkut on the mainland, to Irkutskaya Guba on Olkhon Island.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill was constructed in 1966, directly on the shoreline of Lake Baikal. The plant bleached paper using chlorine and discharged waste directly into Lake Baikal. The decision to construct the plant on the Lake Baikal resulted in strong protests from Soviet scientists; according to them, the ultra-pure water of the lake was a significant resource and should have been used for innovative chemical production (for instance, the production of high-quality viscose for the aeronautics and space industries). The Soviet scientists felt that it was irrational to change Lake Baikal's water quality by beginning paper production on the shore. It was their position that it was also necessary to preserve endemic species of local biota, and to maintain the area around Lake Baikal as a recreation zone [83]. However, the objections of the Soviet scientists faced opposition from the industrial lobby and only after decades of protest, the plant was closed in November 2008 due to unprofitability.[84][85] In March 2009, the plant owner announced the paper mill would never reopen.[86] However, on January 4, 2010, production was resumed. Later that year on January 13, 2010, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin introduced changes in the legislation legalising the operation of the plant; this action brought about a wave of protests from ecologists and local residents.[87] These changes were based on the determination President Putin made through a visual verification of Lake Baikal's condition from a miniature submarine, \\"I could see with my own eyes ÿ and scientists can confirm ÿ Baikal is in good condition and there is practically no pollution\\".[88] Despite this, in September 2013, the mill underwent a final bankruptcy, with the last 800 workers slated to lose their jobs by December 28, 2013.[89] On the day the plant was to close, December 28, 2013, the Russian government announced plans to build the Russian Nature Reserve's Expo Center in place of the closed paper mill.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian oil pipelines state company Transneft[91] was planning to build a trunk pipeline that would have come within 800?m (2,600?ft) of the lake shore in a zone of substantial seismic activity. Environmental activists in Russia,[92] Greenpeace, Baikal pipeline opposition[93] and local citizens[94] were strongly opposed to these plans, due to the possibility of an accidental oil spill that might cause significant damage to the environment. According to the Transneft's president, numerous meetings with citizens near the lake were held in towns along the route, especially in Irkutsk.[95] Transneft agreed to alter its plans when Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the company to consider an alternative route 40 kilometers (25?mi) to the north to avoid such ecological risks.[96] Transneft has since decided to move the pipeline away from Lake Baikal, so that it will not pass through any federal or republic natural reserves.[97][98] Work began on the pipeline two days after President Putin agreed to changing the route away from Lake Baikal.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the Russian government announced plans to build the world's first international uranium enrichment centre at an existing nuclear facility in Angarsk, a city on the river Angara some 95?km (59?mi) downstream from the lake's shores. Critics and environmentalists argued it would be a disaster for the region and are urging the government to reconsider.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter enrichment, only 10% of the uranium-derived radioactive material would be exported to international customers,[100] leaving 90% near the Lake Baikal region for storage. Uranium tailings contain radioactive and toxic materials, which if improperly stored, are potentially dangerous to humans and can contaminate rivers and lakes.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, the enrichment centre was built in the end.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Moscow Times and Vice, an increasing number of an invasive species of algae thrives in the lake from hundreds of tons of liquid waste, including fuel and excrement, regularly disposed into the lake by tourist sites, and up to 25,000 tons of liquid waste are disposed of every year by local ships.[102][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first European to reach the lake is said to have been Kurbat Ivanov in 1643.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, the Baikal was referred to by many Russians as the \\"Baikal Sea\\" (Russian: ѿ , More Baikal), rather than merely \\"Lake Baikal\\" (Russian: Ѿ , Ozero Baikal).[105]\\r\\nThis usage is attested already in the Life of Protopope Avvakum (1621ÿ1682),[106] and on the late-17th-century maps by Semyon Remezov.[107] It is also attested in the famous song, now passed into the tradition, that opens with the words Ѷ־ ѿ, ־Ͷֳ  (Glorious sea, [the] sacred Bajkal).\\r\\nTo this day, the strait between the western shore of the Lake and the Olkhon Island is called Maloye More ( ѿ), i.e. \\"the Little Sea\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal is nicknamed \\"Older sister of Sister Lakes (Lake Kh?vsg?l and Lake Baikal)\\".[108]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 19th-century traveler T. W. Atkinson, locals in the Lake Baikal Region had the tradition that Christ visited the area:\\r\\nThe people have a tradition in connection with this region which they implicitly believe. They say \\"that Christ visited this part of Asia and ascended this summit, whence he looked down on all the region around. After blessing the country to the northward, he turned towards the south, and looking across the Baikal, he waved his hand, exclaiming 'Beyond this there is nothing.'\\" Thus they account for the sterility of Daouria, where it is said \\"no corn will grow.\\"[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Baikal has been celebrated in several Russian folk songs. Two of these songs are well known in Russia and its neighboring countries, such as Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter song was a secondary theme song for the Soviet Union's second color film, Ballad of Siberia (1947; in Russian: ѿҿ  켼 ҼҰѶ󿹾).","input":"Largest and deepest freshwater lake in the world?"},{"output":"eighth","context":"The eighth season of American Idol premiered on January 13, 2009, and concluded on May 20, 2009. Judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, and Randy Jackson continued to judge the show's contestants, along with Ryan Seacrest as host. The season introduced Kara DioGuardi as the fourth judge on the Idol panel.[1] It was also Abdul's final season as a judge.[2] Kris Allen, a native of Conway, Arkansas, was announced the winner of the competition on May 20, 2009, defeating runner-up Adam Lambert after nearly 100 million votes. Kris Allen is the only married winner of the competition at the time of his victory. This was the second season where both of the final two contestants had been in the bottom three or two at least once before the finale, with the first being season three.\\r\\nThe eighth season saw numerous changes to the format of the show. There were 36 semi-finalists instead of 24, and thirteen finalists instead of twelve, nine contestants chosen by the public and four by the judges in a wild card round. Another addition was the \\"save,\\" which was used on the top seven results show to veto Matt Giraud's elimination.\\r\\nSeven contestants from this season were signed to record deals. The signed artists are Kris Allen, who was then signed to 19 Entertainment/Jive Records. In addition to Allen, Adam Lambert, Danny Gokey, Allison Iraheta, Lil Rounds, Anoop Desai and Michael Sarver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral changes were planned for season eight. Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly stated that Idol would feature fewer \\"William Hung-like\\" contestants and \\"funny auditions,\\" and would quickly move its focus to the potential singers during the earlier stages of the competition, thus moving the season at a faster pace.[3] Mike Darnell, president of Fox's alternative programming, said the contestants would be more emotional and that viewers would learn more about them and their pasts than they had in the previous season.[4] Songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge on the panel. She had previously collaborated with Celine Dion, Hilary Duff, Britney Spears, Enrique Iglesias, Leona Lewis and Christina Aguilera, and produced several Top 40 hits. As a songwriter, she had already worked with several American Idol alumni and winners, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, David Archuleta and David Cook.[5] Meanwhile, Ken Warwick became the new executive producer, as Nigel Lythgoe had left the show to focus on So You Think You Can Dance and his new show with Simon Fuller, Superstars of Dance.[6] Idol Gives Back was canceled for season 8, as the ongoing economic crisis and recession, left Idol officials uncomfortable asking financially struggling viewers to donate.[7] The semifinals saw the biggest change as the wild card round returned for the first time since the third season. After voters picked three finalists from each of three groups of 12 semi-finalists, the judges selected eight of the previously eliminated 27 semifinalists to return and perform a song on the March 5, 2009, show. They were judged by the panel, instead of a vote by the viewers, with four advancing to the finals.[8][9] Although the finals had been billed from the beginning of the season as a set of 12 contestants, the judges announced at the last minute that they would be advancing a fourth wild card/thirteenth contestant, Anoop Desai, as well. The eighth season also marked the first time that auditions were conducted outside the United States, when the show traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico to screen potential contestants. Several people from Puerto Rico were eventually selected for the semi-final rounds of the show.\\r\\nAnother change in the Idol format is judges' save, an element previously used in France's Nouvelle Star (French Idol).[10] The judges were given the power to exercise a veto on one eliminated contestant in the finals and spare them from elimination for that particular week. This can only be invoked up until the Final 5. The following week two contestants will be eliminated if the save is used because nobody is eliminated on the week that the save is used, except in season 11 where one only contestant was eliminated. The save can only be used once per season and it must be unanimous. The new format change was revealed on March 11, 2009. The first recipient of the Judges' Save is Matt Giraud. The twelfth season is the first season the judges' save was not used. Placings of the recipients have ranged from eighth place to runner-up.\\r\\nAuditions began July 17 the previous year, and were held in the following cities:[11]\\r\\nContestants were required to be between the ages 16 and 28 on July 15, 2008 and eligible to work in the United States. Contestants were ineligible if they had previously reached the semifinal in Season 1-3 and 7, or the top 44 from season 4 and 5, or top 40 from season 6. They were also ineligible if they held then current recording or management contracts or if they were not U.S. citizens or landed immigrants (i.e. temporary residents).\\r\\nOne auditioner who received widespread publicity was Katrina Darrell, also known as \\"Bikini Girl\\", for auditioning in her bikini. She reached the Hollywood stage but was cut in the group round.[17]\\r\\nFor this season, the Hollywood round moved from the Orpheum Theatre to the Kodak Theatre, which was previously used for the finale in seasons 1 and 3ÿ6. In addition, the Hollywood round was extended to two weeks.\\r\\nIn the first round, the 147 contestants each sang a short solo a cappella performance of any song. The next round had the remaining 107 contestants performing in groups of three or four. Group rounds had returned since season 6. The 72 contestants that passed group day performed one more solo song, this time accompanied by a band, before being narrowed down to 54. The final 54 then went to the \\"judges' mansion\\" in Los Angeles for the final results, and the Top 36 were announced. Some contestants had a sing-off to determine who would enter the top 36. Lacey Brown, who lost in a sing-off with 9th placer Megan Joy, later made the following season's Top 12 where she became the first finalist voted out.\\r\\nThe 36 contestants performed in three groups of twelve and sang songs that were Billboard Hot 100 hits. In each group, three people advanced to the next round, based on votes by the viewers. The top male and female recipient advanced, along with the next highest vote recipient of the remaining ten contestants in each group. Each week two males advanced however it was never revealed who was the highest voted and which advanced through the non-gender specific slot. Following those nine singers advancing, eight of the remaining 27 semi-finalists were selected by the judges to compete in the Wild Card round. Following another performance by each Wild Card contender, the judges selected four contestants to advance to the final group of 13.\\r\\nKris Allen (born June 21, 1985 in Jacksonville, Arkansas, 23 years old at the time of the show) is from Conway, Arkansas and auditioned in Louisville, Kentucky with Leon Russell's \\"A Song For You\\".

Allen was announced the winner on May 20.[19] He went on to release his first official single, \\"No Boundaries\\", which was written by Idol judge Kara DioGuardi. As a part of winning Idol, Allen was signed by Jive Records and 19 Entertainment.[20]\\r\\nAdam Lambert (born January 29, 1982 in Indianapolis, Indiana, 26 years at the time of his audition) is from San Diego, California and auditioned in San Francisco, California with Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Lambert grew up in Rancho Pe?asquitos, San Diego, California and attended Deer Canyon Elementary School, Mesa Verde Middle School, and Mt. Carmel High School, where he took part in theater and choir, and also performed with the school's jazz band.[21] Lambert has been a stage actor since the age of ten, performing in such productions as You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Wicked.[22] He joined the band The Citizen Vein briefly. He also worked as a demo singer, and those recordings were released after his appearance on Idol in the album Take One. Lambert roomed with Kris Allen during the show.[23] Lambert was the runner-up.[19] He was signed to RCA Records after the show and released his debut album For Your Entertainment.\\r\\nDanny Gokey (born April 24, 1980, 28 years at the time of his audition) is from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and auditioned in Kansas City, Missouri. Gokey first began singing in church with his family, and has been a worship leader for his church in Milwaukee, Faith Builders International Ministries, for several years.[24] Four weeks before Gokey auditioned for American Idol, in July 2008, his wife Sophia underwent surgery due to congenital heart disease. She later died from complications regarding the extensive surgery.[25][26] He was eliminated from the Top 3 on May 13, 2009.[19]\\r\\nAllison Iraheta (born April 27, 1992 in Glendale, California, 16 years at the time of her audition) is from Los Angeles and auditioned in San Francisco, California. Iraheta began singing at an early age, performing at small venues for her family and friends.[27] In 2006, Iraheta won the Telemundo television series Quincea?era, where she won $50,000 and a recording contract, where only the prize money was granted.[28] She was eliminated from the Top 4 on May 6. In making the final she became the series' youngest finalist at sixteen and turned seventeen during the Top 5 week. Her debut album, Just Like You, was released on December 1, 2009, with the single \\"Friday I'll Be Over U\\".\\r\\nMatt Giraud (born May 11, 1985 in Dearborn, Michigan, 23 years at his time of the show) is from Kalamazoo, Michigan and auditioned in Louisville, Kentucky with Gavin DeGraw's \\"I Don't Want to Be\\". Giraud grew up in Ypsilanti, Michigan, where he graduated from Lincoln High School in 2003.[29][30] Initially eliminated from the Top 13, Giraud was chosen by the judges to rejoin the competition during the Wild Card round. Giraud was the lowest vote-getter during the Top 7, but was saved by the judges and eventually eliminated in Top 5. He released an album called Perspective in 2003 and another in 2006 called Mind Body and Soul.[30]\\r\\nAnoop Desai (born December 20, 1986 in Cary, North Carolina, 22 years at the time of the show) is from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and auditioned in Kansas City, Missouri. Desai is an only child,[31] whose father was born in India and mother was born in South Africa.[32] He began his career as an actor for the television station WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina in a local television series entitled CentralXpress.com, and played the character \\"Raj\\".[33] Desai attended Carnage Middle School and Phillips Middle School, then later went on to attend East Chapel Hill High School, graduating in 2004.[34] Desais performance as a soloist on the song \\"She Has No Time\\" was included on the 2007 iteration of the annual BOCA (Best of College A Cappella) compilation album.[35] Desai has credited his decision to audition for American Idol to the death of a friend, Eve Carson,[36] who was murdered.[36] Initially eliminated from the Top 13, he was chosen by the judges to rejoin the competition during the Wild Card round. His advancement to the finals made Idol history, making it a top 13.\\r\\nLil Rounds (born October 20, 1984, 24 years at the time of the show) is from Memphis, Tennessee and auditioned in Kansas City, Missouri with Stevie Wonder's \\"All I Do\\" . Shortly before her audition on Idol, a tornado hit Memphis, forcing Rounds to temporarily live in a motel.[37] Her grandfather once worked with the musician B.B. King. Her performance of Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" in the Hollywood round impressed the judges; however, she failed to impress the judges in the finals and was eliminated in joint-seventh place with Anoop Desai.\\r\\nScott MacIntyre (born June 22, 1985, 23 years at the time of the show) is from Scottsdale, Arizona and auditioned in Phoenix, Arizona. MacIntyre is the first legally blind person to audition for American Idol.[38] MacIntyre began practicing music at the age of six.[39] Home-schooled until the age of fourteen,[40] he later attended Arizona State University's Barrett Honors College and Herberger College of the Arts soon afterwards.[41] In 2005, USA Today named him one of its twenty College Academic All-Stars.[42] He obtained his master's degree at Royal Holloway, University of London and the Royal College of Music, where he studied on a Marshall Scholarship.

She was later disqualified and replaced by Felicia Barton.[61]\\r\\nIn the Top 13, the expected phone number for contestant Alexis Grace, 1-866-IDOLS-13, was not owned by American Idol, but by a company called Intimate Encounters, who used it as a phone sex line.[62] Although host Ryan Seacrest mentioned the replacement phone number, 1-866-IDOLS-36, several times, some commentators feared that the phone number confusion could lead to Grace being inadvertently voted off the show.[63] However, Grace was not voted off that week.\\r\\nAfter the Top 11 program, Justin Guarini, while hosting Idol Wrap on TV Guide channel, asserted that the show's group performances were being lip-synced.[64] Soon after Guarini's assertion was aired, a spokesperson for the producers of American Idol said, \\"The Idols don't lip-sync, period.\\"[64] The following day, the same spokesperson said that \\"due to extensive choreography and to balance their voices with open mics against a screaming audience, the Idols do sing along to their own prerecorded vocal track during the group performances only.\\"[64][65] The spokesperson maintained that the performers sing their solo songs live, but their performances available to download through iTunes are recorded prior to airing.[64]\\r\\nKris Allen's win over Adam Lambert resulted in controversy about the voting process, prompted by a claim that of the nearly 100 million votes cast,[66] as many as \\"38 million\\" votes may have come from Arkansas, Kris's home state,[67] a state with only 2.86 million people. Although the claim was later retracted,[68] it resulted in allegations that AT&T may have influenced the results.[69] Fox had previously denied these claims as baseless, stating that the network has no preference on who the winner might be.[70] AT&T meanwhile said in a statement that the vote tally above was based on incorrect information and apologized by saying that \\"AT&T does not divulge or confirm how many votes were cast in any state.\\"[71] On May 27, 2009, the producers of the show stated that they \\"stand by the outcome\\" and are \\"absolutely certain\\" that \\"without a doubt Kris Allen is the American Idol.\\"[72][73][74]\\r\\nSeason eight was the top show for the 2008ÿ09 broadcast primetime season and took the top two spots for its Tuesday and Wednesday episodes.

As the majority of the population in Hong Kong are descendants of migrants from China's Canton Province, the vast majority speak standard Cantonese or other Yue Chinese varieties as a first language, with smaller numbers of speakers of Hakka Language or the Teochew dialect of Southern Min. In addition, immigrants and expatriates from the West and other Asian countries have contributed much to Hong Kong's linguistic and demographic diversity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese and English are both official languages of Hong Kong under the Hong Kong Basic Law (article 9) and the Official Languages Ordinance (chapter 5 of the Laws of Hong Kong). No law stipulates choice of spoken Chinese dialect.[citation needed]\\r\\nHistorically, English was the sole official language of Hong Kong from 1883 to 1974. Only after demonstrations and petitions from Hong Kong people demanding equal status for Chinese[3] did the language become official in Hong Kong from 1974 onward. In March 1987, the Official Languages Ordinance was amended to require all new legislation to be enacted bilingually in both English and Chinese. In 1990, the Hong Kong Basic Law declared English's co-official language status with Chinese after the 1997 handover.\\r\\nAs a result of immigration into Hong Kong from Canton Province, Cantonese is the dominant Chinese variant spoken in the territory with smaller numbers of speakers from other dialects. There are also numerous sinitic languages spoken by the native peoples of the New Territories, many of which are mutually unintelligible. Cantonese is a vernacular and when reduced to writing is normally converted to a standard written Chinese quite dissimilar to the spoken word.\\r\\nThere is also a written language based on the vocabulary and grammar of spoken Cantonese known as written Cantonese (?\`). Although the \\"biliterate and trilingual\\" policy implies an absence of support for written Cantonese, it has gained popularity in news media where entertainment and local news are related. Written Cantonese is unintelligible to non-Cantonese speakers and is considered nonstandard by educators despite its widespread usage in Hong Kong. Some have also credited written Cantonese for solving the challenges that standard written Chinese had faced in popular culture.\\r\\nTraditional Chinese characters are widely used, and are the de facto writing standard in Hong Kong. Simplified Chinese is seen in some posters, leaflets, flyers and signs in the tourist areas.\\r\\nThe principal language of Hong Kong is standard Cantonese, spoken by 87.5% of the population at home daily.(?/?V?/?V?|?/?V?/?/A?),[4] As an official language, it is used in education, broadcasting, government administration, legislation and judiciary, as well as for daily communication. As a result of its predominance throughout the community, Cantonese is virtually the exclusive language of official discourse at all levels of the executive, legislature and courts of Hong Kong.[citation needed]\\r\\nA few closely related dialects to standard Cantonese continue to be spoken in Hong Kong. Most notable is the Weitou dialect (??M?), which is mostly spoken by the older generation living in walled villages in New Territories. Additionally, the Tanka people (?ģ??/ԡģ??/if??) from the fishing villages on outlying islands speak their own variant of Cantonese. However, this dialect is now largely limited to those middle aged and above.\\r\\nHakka is indigenous to many villages in the New Territories and within Hakka communities in Hong Kong. Nowadays, outside these rural villages and older populations, younger Hakka Chinese populations communicate primarily in Cantonese.[5][6]\\r\\nTeochew, Hokkien, and Taiwanese are the Minnan (Southern Min) Chinese dialects commonly found in Hong Kong. However, their usage is largely limited to recent migrants from Taiwan or Fujian and middle aged descendants of immigrants from native Chinese regions of these variants.\\r\\nTaishanese originates from migrants from Taishan County in Mainland China. The variant can still be found in some areas in Hong Kong where migrants concentrated, such as Sai Wan.\\r\\nShanghainese is commonly spoken by migrants who escaped Shanghai after the communist takeover of China in 1949. Their descendants seldom speak the language nowadays.\\r\\nWhen Hong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom, Mandarin Chinese (ѻo?/y???h/?}Z/Դ?) was not widely used in Hong Kong. Since the 1997 Handover, the huge increase in inbound tourism from the mainland has led to much more widespread use of Mandarin, particularly in tourism-related commerce, though little impact has been seen in locally based commerce or public services.[citation needed] In addition, the large number of shuangfei (Traditional:ю, Simplified:ߖʨ children (children born in Hong Kong whose parents are both from the Mainland) has increased the number of Mandarin speaking people, particularly in districts close to the border, such that Mandarin speaking children make up large proportions or even the majority of primary school students in those districts, causing the beginnings of a language shift in those areas.\\r\\nEnglish is a major working language in Hong Kong, and is widely used in commercial activities and legal matters. Although the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC by the United Kingdom in 1997, English remains one of the official languages of Hong Kong as enshrined in the Basic Law.\\r\\nMany Hong Kong people use both Cantonese and English, or \\"code-switch\\", in the same sentence when speaking. For example, \\"?q͕ make sense!\\" (\\"Wow, it does not make sense!\\"). The code-switching can freely mix English words and Chinese grammar, for instance \\" un ͕ understand?\\" (\\"Do you understand?\\") which follows the Chinese grammar syntax 'verb - ͕ - verb' to ask \\"Do you (verb)?\\".\\r\\nSome code-switched words are used so often that they have become loanwords in Cantonese,[7] for example,\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, French is the second most studied foreign language after Japanese. Many institutions in Hong Kong, like Alliance fran?aise, provide French courses. Local universities, such as the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Baptist University, offer programmes which aim at developing proficiency in French language and culture. The language is included as a subject in the HKCEE, but not in HKALE with accordance to British International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) standards. The IGCSE French syllabus used by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES) is adopted in the examination. The only French book store, Librairie Parentheses, in Hong Kong is located on Wellington Street, Central.[8]\\r\\nReal estate developers in Hong Kong often give their buildings French names, such as Bel-Air, Les Saisons and Belle Mer. This kind of foreign branding is also used in boutiques and restaurants. An example is Yucca de Lac in Ma Liu Shui. Sometimes only French elements such as articles and prepositions are added to the name, as in the case of the restaurant chain Caf de Coral. Similar mixing of English and French can be seen on the menu of Dlifrance, a French-style restaurant chain in Hong Kong.\\r\\nThe number of German speakers in Hong Kong is about 5000, significant enough for the establishment of the German Swiss International School (Deutsch-Schweizerische Internationale Schule), which claims to number more than 1,000 students, at The Peak of Hong Kong Island.[9] Many institutions in Hong Kong provide German courses. The most well-known one is the Goethe-Institut, which is located in Wan Chai. After spending a certain period in learning German, students can take the German Test as a Foreign Language (Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache; TestDaF for short) and Start German A1-C2. There are currently two test centres for TestDaF in Hong Kong: the Goethe-Institut and the Hong Kong Baptist University. The latter one also offers a European Studies degree course of German Stream, Bachelor of Social Science in European Studies (German Stream), in parallel with the French stream. A minor program of German is offered at the Language Centre of HKBU. The Hong Kong University offers a Major in German after 4 years of study. The Chinese University offers a Minor in German and popular summer courses. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology offers German for science and technology.\\r\\nThere are over 25,000 Japanese people in Hong Kong, so it is not uncommon to hear Japanese conversations. More than 10,000 people in Hong Kong had taken the JLPT in 2005.[10] Hong Kong-based R by R Production produces a television travel show set in Japan, which, as of April 2016, is broadcast on ViuTV. However, the language is often misused.[11]\\r\\nJapanese culture, especially the popular culture, has been popular in Hong Kong for decades. Hong Kong people occasionally replace Chinese characters with Japanese. In addition, the Companies Registry also permits the hiragana  (no) in Chinese business names that are registered in Hong Kong.[12] The hiragana  is usually used in place of the Chinese character  (zi1) and read as such in Hong Kong. In fact, Aji Ichiban has adopted  in their company name (??i). There are also borrowings from Japanese shinjitai kanji x (eki) to substitute  (Sidney Lau: jaam6)(both  and x mean \\"station\\" in their respective languages), as in Nu Front (?|x), a shopping mall for Hong Kong youngsters in Causeway Bay. There are also some private estates named with the kanji x. These loanwords are pronounced by Hong Kong people as if they were their Chinese counterparts (i.e.  as , and x as ). The Japanese x is the shinjitai of the hanzi ֝ (Sidney Lau: yik6). However, ֝ has fallen out of usage to  in modern Chinese and became obsolete. Therefore, it is not uncommon to mispronounce x as its phonetic compound ϲ(Sidney Lau: chek3)).\\r\\nKoreans in Hong Kong only make up a small minority while Korean culture has gained popularity since the early 2000s. Korean pop music was the first Korean media to enter Hong Kong's market. Since then, several Korean TV series such as Dae Jang Geum have been broadcast to numerous audiences.[13] There are roughly 1,000 students that took Korean courses at the Chinese University of Hong Kong each year, including undergraduates as well as professionals who enrolled in continuing education programs. Roughly 3,000 people have taken the Test of Proficiency in Korean since its introduction to Hong Kong in 2003.[14] Surveys and statistics from course enrollments have shown that nine-tenths of the students studying Korean in Hong Kong are female.[15]\\r\\nFilipino and other Philippine languages are used by Filipinos in Hong Kong, most of whom are employed as foreign domestic workers.\\r\\nNewspapers and magazines in Filipino can also be easily bought in Central, Hong Kong. There are also a small number of churches in Hong Kong that have masses or services in Filipino, for example the afternoon masses provided by the St. John's Cathedral in Central.\\r\\nIndonesian is the common language for the significant number of Indonesians working in Hong Kong, though Javanese is also widely spoken. Most are domestic workers; on their days off, they often gather at Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to socialise and the language can be heard.[16]\\r\\nThai prevails among the Thai population in Hong Kong, who mostly work as domestic workers. The Thai language is found in many shops and restaurants opened by Thais in Kowloon City. A number of Thai movies have been imported since the early 2000s, such as The Wheel in the medley Three, Jan Dara, the Iron Ladies, My Little Girl, and Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior and Tom-Yum-Goong starring Tony Jaa.\\r\\nVietnamese is used in Hong Kong among the ethnic Chinese from Vietnam who had initially settled in Vietnam and returned to Hong Kong. Vietnamese refugees who left their home during the Vietnam War are another group.\\r\\nIn 2006, there were at least 44,744 persons of South Asian descent in Hong Kong.[17] Signboards written in Hindi or Urdu can be seen, and conversation in South Asian languages including Nepali, Sindhi and Punjabi, as well as Urdu, Hindi and Tamil can be heard.\\r\\nHong Kong has two Nepalese newspapers, The Everest and the Sunrise Weekly Hong Kong. In 2004, the Home Affairs Bureau and Metro Plus AM 1044 jointly launched radio shows Hong Kong-Pak Tonight in Urdu and Harmo Sagarmatha in Nepalese.[18]\\r\\nThe history of Indians in Hong Kong can be traced back to the early days of British Hong Kong. When the Union flag of the United Kingdom was hoisted on 26 January 1841, there were around 2,700 Indian troops that participated, and they played an important role in the development of Hong Kong in the early days. The most prominent contributions were the founding of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and the Star Ferry.\\r\\nAlthough nearly all of the Indian people who live in Hong Kong speak and write Indian English, some have maintained the usage of Hindi as a second language.\\r\\nArabic is used frequently among members of Muslim communities in Hong Kong. Some Islamic organisations do teach the language as well, but the current status can best be described as up-and-coming.[19]\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region","input":"What language do they soeak in hong kong?"},{"output":"Orson Welles","context":"","input":"Who was the ground-breaking cinematographer on citizen kane?"},{"output":"six-element lens","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7: 12 MP 2nd-generation Sony Exmor RS[8] with six-element lens, quad-LED \\"True Tone\\" flash, autofocus, IR filter, Burst mode, f/1.8 aperture, 4K video recording at 30?fps or 1080p at 30 or 60?fps, slow-motion video (1080p at 120?fps and 720p at 240?fps), timelapse with stabilization, panorama, facial recognition, digital image stabilization, optical image stabilization\\r\\n\\r\\niPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus on September 22, 2017, and the iPhone X on November 3, 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6S, but introduces new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, and removes the 3.5?mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware also received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, and upgraded 12?megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models and an additional telephoto lens on the iPhone 7 Plus model to provide enhanced zoom capabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nReception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that the iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of the iPhone 7. Many reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5?mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required \\"courage\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPhone 7 has been the subject of several reported issues, most notably a hissing noise during heavy usage of the phones and significant differences in performance between device variants. Apple has not released sales numbers for iPhone 7, but multiple U.S. carriers reported that it was in high demand on launch. Subsequent reports at the end of 2016 stated that Apple had reduced production of the models due to \\"sluggish\\" sales and decreasing demand, though sales research after the first quarter of 2017 placed the devices as the best-selling smartphones in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to its official announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5?mm headphone jack received significant media attention.[19] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers,[20] a 256?gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016 were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement.[22][23] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16.[24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016.[34] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign.  It launched on March 24, 2017,[36][37] but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X in September 2017.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,[39] alongside the iPhone X.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 4, 2018, the NYPD began rolling out about 600 phones per day to its officers, who get to choose between an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, switching from the failed Windows Phone.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new colors of matte black, glossy \\"jet black\\",[24] and, for a limited time, red.[36][37] The \\"jet black\\" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an \\"ultrafine particle bath\\" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\niPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant,[43] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[44] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\niPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[46][47] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[48] iPhone 7 retains the \\"3D Touch\\" display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPhone 7 does not feature a 3.5?mm headphone jack; it was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer.[49] A Lightning-to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, are bundled with the device,[24] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory.[50] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\niPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[52]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of \\"console-level gaming\\".[53] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7-inch screen, and a \\"Plus\\" variant with a 5.5-inch screen.[54] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[24] and increased brightness.[55] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[58] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32?GB instead of 16?GB, and max out at 256?GB.[59] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3?GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[52] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2?GB.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED \\"True Tone\\" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization?ÿ  a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models.[61] The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2G optical zoom, and up to 10G digital zoom. The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization.[24][62]\\r\\n\\r\\niPhone 7 ships with iOS 10 pre-installed.[63] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[64] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus.[65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach iPhone 7 comes with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter.[24] Apple sells the adapter independently as well.[50] Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as Apple W1, which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS products (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nReception to the iPhone 7 was mixed. Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \\"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\\".[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nNilay Patel of The Verge described the devices as being \\"full of aggressive breaks from convention\\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \\"a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6\\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of wireless headphones), heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \\"not as insane\\" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \\"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\\" (as opposed to the \\"gimmick\\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \\"step\\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \\"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \\"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer.\\"[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was \\"markedly better\\" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras \\"excellent\\" for point-and-shoot, and \\"much improved\\" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was \\"initially frustrating\\", but noted that it was a \\"positive step forward for the mobile industry\\", despite the \\"short-term effects ... making the most noise for now\\".[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nCriticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously.[a][73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack - \\"ditching a deeply established standard\\" - would be \\"user-hostile and stupid\\". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with \\"No one is asking for this\\" and \\"Vote with your dollars\\".[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nGordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior while Lightning audio reliability was still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant \\"youre being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing\\", and pointed out that \\"the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies\\".[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn particular, Apple's vice president Phil Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'.[75][76] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack,[77] reached over 300,000 signatures.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as \\"faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside\\".[79] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to \\"hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Macs CPU gets used to its actual potential.\\"[80] The issue has been referred to as Hissgate.[81][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is \\"significantly\\" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model.[83] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had \\"a significant performance edge\\" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to \\"level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants\\". The report concluded with the statement that \\"We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone\\".[84][85] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that \\"Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apples wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models\\". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that \\"[Apple] dont want one version to get the reputation that it is better\\" and that \\"This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product\\".[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a similar manner with the now-discontinued Samsung Galaxy Note 7, there have been reports of the iPhone 7 exploding or emitting smoke. In September 2016, one device reportedly exploded while in transit,[87][88] while another one had a \\"malfunction that caused the battery to blow up internally\\".[89] Another report about an iPhone 7 emitting smoke and \\"melting\\" was published in October 2016.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPhone 7's \\"This is 7\\" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages. [91][92]\\r\\nThe phone's slogan in Mainland China is \\"7, is here;\\" (Chinese: 7ۊɭ; pinyin: 7, zi c), while in Hong Kong, its slogan is, \\"This, is iPhone 7;\\" (Chinese: iPhone 7; Jyutping: ze5, zau6 si6 iPhone 7). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong, the slogan could be mistakenly interpreted as \\"This is penis\\". \\"Tsat\\",\\r\\n(Chinese: ?o; Jyutping: cat6), is a common slang term for an erect penis, and \\"seven\\", (Chinese: ; Jyutping: cat1), which varies only in tone, is often used as a eupuemism.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with \\"recalibration\\" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the \\"return-to-home\\" functionality still worked.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1780 and A1779 suffer from a problem where they show a \\"No service\\" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within two years of the first retail sale of the unit.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are \\"no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers\\".[96] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being \\"up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone\\".[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all \\"jet black\\" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus.[98] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program, who were unable to reserve new phones.[99] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit,[100] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5?million and 17.4?million units, respectively.[102][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the initial U.S. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months.[104] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals \\"essentially lock you into that carrier for two years\\".[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced \\"huge increases in sales\\", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model.[107][108]\\r\\n\\r\\nA new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, \\"based on data from suppliers\\", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following \\"sluggish\\" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had \\"sold more sluggishly than expected\\". Additionally, the report notes that the \\"iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular\\", but \\"a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones\\".[109]","input":"What kind of lens does iphone 7 have?"},{"output":"120 miles","context":"","input":"How far is knoxville tn from chattanooga tn?"},{"output":"John Browning","context":"The M1911 is a single-action, semi-automatic, magazine-fed, recoil-operated pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge.[1] It served as the standard-issue sidearm for the United States Armed Forces from 1911 to 1986. It was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The pistol's formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam War era.[1]\\r\\nThe U.S. procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols in military contracts during its service life. The M1911 was replaced by the 9mm Beretta M9 pistol as the standard U.S. sidearm in October 1986, but due to its popularity among users, it has not been completely phased out. Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces and the U.S. Navy.\\r\\nDesigned by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols. It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA, IDPA, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and Bullseye shooting. Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons in the U.S. because of the design's relatively slim width and stopping power[4] of the .45 ACP cartridge.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M1911 pistol originated in the late 1890s as the result of a search for a suitable self-loading (or semi-automatic) pistol to replace the variety of revolvers then in service.[6] The United States was adopting new firearms at a phenomenal rate; several new pistols and two all-new service rifles (the M1892/96/98 Krag and M1895 Navy Lee), as well as a series of revolvers by Colt and Smith & Wesson for the Army and Navy, were adopted just in that decade. The next decade would see a similar pace, including the adoption of several more revolvers and an intensive search for a self-loading pistol that would culminate in official adoption of the M1911 after the turn of the decade.\\r\\nHiram S. Maxim had designed a self-loading rifle in the 1880s, but was preoccupied with machine guns. Nevertheless, the application of his principle of using cartridge energy to reload led to several self-loading pistols in 1896. The designs caught the attention of various militaries, each of which began programs to find a suitable one for their forces. In the U.S., such a program would lead to a formal test at the turn of the 20th century.[7]\\r\\nDuring the end of 1899 and start of 1900, a test of self-loading pistols was conducted, which included entries from Mauser (the C96 \\"Broomhandle\\"), Mannlicher (the Mannlicher M1894), and Colt (the Colt M1900).[6]\\r\\nThis led to a purchase of 1,000 DWM Luger pistols, chambered in 7.65mm Luger, a bottlenecked cartridge. During field trials these ran into some problems, especially with stopping power. Other governments had made similar complaints. Consequently, DWM produced an enlarged version of the round, the 9G19mm Parabellum (known in current military parlance as the 9G19mm NATO), a necked-up version of the 7.65?mm round. Fifty of these were tested as well by the U.S. Army in 1903.[8]\\r\\nAmerican units fighting Moro guerrillas during the PhilippineÿAmerican War using the then-standard Colt M1892 revolver, .38 Long Colt, found it to be unsuitable for the rigors of jungle warfare, particularly in terms of stopping power, as the Moros had high battle morale and often used drugs to inhibit the sensation of pain.[9] The U.S. Army briefly reverted to using the M1873 single-action revolver in .45 Colt caliber, which had been standard during the late 19th century; the heavier bullet was found to be more effective against charging tribesmen.[10] The problems prompted the Chief of Ordnance, General William Crozier, to authorize further testing for a new service pistol.[10]\\r\\nFollowing the 1904 Thompson-LaGarde pistol round effectiveness tests, Colonel John T. Thompson stated that the new pistol \\"should not be of less than .45 caliber\\" and would preferably be semi-automatic in operation.[10] This led to the 1906 trials of pistols from six firearms manufacturing companies (namely, Colt, Bergmann, Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM), Savage Arms Company, Knoble, Webley, and White-Merrill).[10]\\r\\nOf the six designs submitted, three were eliminated early on, leaving only the Savage, Colt, and DWM designs chambered in the new .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge.[10] These three still had issues that needed correction, but only Colt and Savage resubmitted their designs. There is some debate over the reasons for DWM's withdrawalsome say they felt there was bias and that the DWM design was being used primarily as a \\"whipping boy\\" for the Savage and Colt pistols,[11] though this does not fit well with the earlier 1900 purchase of the DWM design over the Colt and Steyr entries. In any case, a series of field tests from 1907 to 1911 were held to decide between the Savage and Colt designs.[10] Both designs were improved between each testing over their initial entries, leading up to the final test before adoption.[10]\\r\\nAmong the areas of success for the Colt was a test at the end of 1910 attended by its designer, John Browning. Six thousand rounds were fired from a single pistol over the course of two days. When the gun began to grow hot, it was simply immersed in water to cool it. The Colt gun passed with no reported malfunctions, while the Savage designs had 37.[10]\\r\\nFollowing its success in trials, the Colt pistol was formally adopted by the Army on March 29, 1911, when it was designated Model of 1911, later changed to Model 1911, in 1917, and then M1911, in the mid-1920s. The Director of Civilian Marksmanship began manufacture of M1911 pistols for members of the National Rifle Association in August 1912. Approximately 100 pistols stamped \\"N.R.A.\\" below the serial number were manufactured at Springfield Armory and by Colt.[12] The M1911 was formally adopted by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in 1913.\\r\\nBy the beginning of 1917, a total of 68,533 M1911 pistols had been delivered to U.S. armed forces by Colt Firearms Company and the U.S. government's Springfield Armory. However, the need to greatly expand U.S. military forces and the resultant surge in demand for the firearm in World War I saw the expansion of manufacture to other contractors besides Colt and Springfield Armory, including Remington-UMC, North American Arms Co. of Quebec.[13] Several other manufacturers were awarded contracts to produce the M1911, including the National Cash Register Company, the Savage Arms Company, the Caron Bros. of Montreal, the Burroughs Adding Machine Co., Winchester Repeating Arms Company, and the Lanston Monotype Company, but the signing of the Armistice resulted in the cancellation of the contracts before any pistols had been produced.\\r\\nBattlefield experience in World War I led to some more small external changes, completed in 1924. The new version received a modified type classification, M1911A1, in 1926 with a stipulation that M1911A1s should have serial numbers higher than 700,000 with lower serial numbers designated M1911.[14] The M1911A1 changes to the original design consisted of a shorter trigger, cutouts in the frame behind the trigger, an arched mainspring housing, a longer grip safety spur (to prevent hammer bite), a wider front sight, a shortened hammer spur, and simplified grip checkering (eliminating the \\"Double Diamond\\" reliefs).[10] These changes were subtle and largely intended to make the pistol easier to shoot for those with smaller hands. Many persons unfamiliar with the design are often unable to tell the difference between the two versions at a glance. No significant internal changes were made, and parts remained interchangeable between the M1911 and the M1911A1.[10]\\r\\nWorking for the U.S. Ordnance Office, David Marshall Williams developed a .22 training version of the M1911 using a floating chamber to give the .22 long rifle rimfire recoil similar to the .45 version.[10] As the Colt Service Ace, this was available both as a pistol and as a conversion kit for .45 M1911 pistols.[10]\\r\\nBefore World War II, a small number of modified M1911-pattern pistols in .45 caliber were produced under license by the Norwegian arms factory Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk, designated \\"Pistol M/1914\\" and unofficially known as \\"Kongsberg Colt\\". Production continued after the German occupation of Norway in 1940. The Pistol M/1914 is noted for its unusual extended slide stop which was specified by Norwegian ordnance authorities. Throughout the M/1914's use in Norwegian military service, Norway continued to build the M/1914 pistol as originally specified. These pistols are highly regarded by modern collectors, with the 920 examples stamped with German Army inspectors proof (Waffenamt) codes and the unknown number of unmarked examples assembled by the Norwegian resistance movement (the \\"Matpakke-Colt\\" or \\"Lunch Box Colt\\") being the most sought after. German forces also used captured M1911A1 pistols, using the designation \\"Pistole 660(a)\\".[15]\\r\\nThe M1911 and M1911A1 pistols were also ordered from Colt or produced domestically in modified form by several other nations, including Argentina (Modello 1916 and Modello 1927 contract pistols), and the BallesterÿMolina), Brazil (M1937 contract pistol), Mexico (M1911 Mexican contract pistol and the Obreg܇n pistol), and Spain (private manufacturers Star and Llama).\\r\\nWorld War II and the years leading up to it created a great demand. During the war, about 1.9 million units were procured by the U.S. Government for all forces, production being undertaken by several manufacturers, including Remington Rand (900,000 produced), Colt (400,000), Ithaca Gun Company (400,000), Union Switch & Signal (50,000), and Singer (500). New M1911A1 pistols were given a parkerized metal finish instead of blueing, and the wood grip panels were replaced with panels made of brown plastic. The M1911A1 was a favored small arm of both US and allied military personnel during the war, in particular, the pistol was prized by some British commando units and Britain's highly covert Special Operations Executive, as well as South African Commonwealth forces.[16][17][18]\\r\\nSo many 1911A1 pistols were produced during the war that the government cancelled all postwar contracts for new production, instead choosing to rebuild existing pistols with new parts, which were then refinished and tested for functioning. From the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s thousands of 1911s and 1911A1s were refurbished at U.S. Arsenals and Service depots. These arsenal rebuilds consisted of anything from minor inspections to major overhauls of pistols returned from service use. Pistols that were refurbished at Government arsenals will usually be marked on the frame/receiver with the arsenal's initials, such as RIA (Rock Island Armory) or SA (Springfield Armory).\\r\\nAmong collectors today, the Singer-produced pistols in particular are highly prized, commanding high prices even in poor condition.[19]\\r\\nFrom 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set was issued to some generals in the US Army. It was composed of a leather belt, leather enclosed flap-holster with braided leather tie-down leg strap, leather two-pocket magazine pouch, and a rope neck lanyard. The metal buckle and fittings were in gilded brass. The buckle had the seal of the U.S. on the center (or \\"male\\") piece and a laurel wreath on the circular (or \\"female\\") piece. The pistol was a standard-issue M1911A1 that came with a cleaning kit and three magazines.\\r\\nFrom 1972 to 1981 a modified M1911A1 called the RIA M15 General Officer's Model was issued to General Officers in the US Army and US Air Force. From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both came with a black leather belt, open holster with retaining strap, and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer's Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force. The M15 and M1911A1 were replaced with the M9 pistol in 1986.\\r\\nAfter World War II, the M1911 continued to be a mainstay of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. It was used during Desert Storm in specialized U.S. Army units and U.S. Navy Mobile Construction Battalions (Seabees), and has seen service in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, with U.S. Army Special Forces Groups and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Companies.[20]\\r\\nHowever, by the late 1970s, the M1911A1 was acknowledged to be showing its age. Under political pressure from Congress to standardize on a single modern pistol design, the U.S. Air Force ran a Joint Service Small Arms Program to select a new semi-automatic pistol using the NATO-standard 9?mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. After trials, the Beretta 92S-1 was chosen. The Army contested this result and subsequently ran its own competition in 1981, the XM9 trials, eventually leading to the official adoption of the Beretta 92F on January 14, 1985.[21][22][23] By the late 1980s production was ramping up despite a controversial XM9 retrial and a separate XM10 reconfirmation that was boycotted by some entrants of the original trials, cracks in the frames of some pre-M9 Beretta-produced pistols, and despite a problem with slide separation using higher-than-specified-pressure rounds that resulted in injuries to some U.S. Navy special operations operatives. This last issue resulted in an updated model that includes additional protection for the user, the 92FS, and updates to the ammunition used.[24]\\r\\nBy the early 1990s, most M1911A1s had been replaced by the Beretta M9, though a limited number remain in use by special units. The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in particular were noted for continuing the use of M1911 pistols for selected personnel in MEU(SOC) and reconnaissance units (though the USMC also purchased over 50,000 M9 pistols.[citation needed]) For its part, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issued a requirement for a .45 ACP pistol in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) trials. This resulted in the Heckler & Koch OHWS becoming the MK23 Mod 0 Offensive Handgun Weapon System (itself being heavily based on the 1911's basic field strip), beating the Colt OHWS, a much modified M1911. Dissatisfaction with the stopping power of the 9?mm Parabellum cartridge used in the Beretta M9 has actually promoted re-adoption of pistols based on the .45 ACP cartridge such as the M1911 design, along with other pistols, among USSOCOM units in recent years, though the M9 remains predominant both within SOCOM and in the U.S. military in general.[20]\\r\\nMarine Expeditionary Units formerly issued M1911s to Force Recon units.[25] Hand-selected Colt M1911A1 frames were gutted, deburred, and prepared for additional use by the USMC Precision Weapon Section (PWS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico.[25] They were then assembled with after-market grip safeties, ambidextrous thumb safeties, triggers, improved high-visibility sights, accurized barrels, grips, and improved Wilson magazines.[26] These hand-made pistols were tuned to specifications and preferences of end users.[27]\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, the Marines laid out a series of specifications and improvements to make Browning's design ready for 21st century combat, many of which have been included in MEU (SOC) pistol designs, but design and supply time was limited.[27] Discovering that the Los Angeles Police Department was pleased with their special Kimber M1911 pistols, a single source request was issued to Kimber for just such a pistol despite the imminent release of their TLE/RLII models.[28] Kimber shortly began producing a limited number of what would be later termed the Interim Close Quarters Battle pistol (ICQB). Maintaining the simple recoil assembly, 5-inch barrel (though using a stainless steel match grade barrel), and internal extractor, the ICQB is not much different from Browning's original design.[28]\\r\\nIn July 2012, the U.S. Marines placed a $22.5 million order for 12,000 M1911 pistols for MEU(SOC) forces.[29] The new 1911 was designated M45A1 or \\"Close Quarters Battle Pistol\\" CQBP. The M45A1 features a dual recoil spring assembly, Picatinny rails and is cerakoted tan in color.\\r\\nIn September 2016, it was reported that the U.S. Marine Corps decided to withdraw the M1911 from use by special operators.[30]\\r\\nMany military and law enforcement organizations in the U.S. and other countries continue to use (often modified) M1911A1 pistols including Los Angeles Police Department SWAT and S.I.S., the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, FBI regional SWAT teams, and 1st Special Forces Operational DetachmentDelta (Delta Force).\\r\\nThe M1911A1 is popular among the general public in the U.S. for practical and recreational purposes. The pistol is commonly used for concealed carry thanks in part to a single-stack magazine (which makes for a thinner pistol that is, therefore, easier to conceal), personal defense, target shooting, and competition. Numerous aftermarket accessories allow users to customize the pistol to their liking. There are a growing number of manufacturers of M1911-type pistols and the model continues to be quite popular for its reliability, simplicity, and patriotic appeal. Various tactical, target and compact models are available. Price ranges from a low end of around $400 for basic pistols imported from the Philippines or Turkey (Armscor, Tisas, Rock Island Armory, Girsan, STI Spartan, Seraphim Armoury) to more than $4,000 for the best competition or tactical versions (Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, Les Baer, Nighthawk Custom, and STI International).[31]\\r\\nDue to an increased demand for M1911 pistols among Army Special Operations units, who are known to field a variety of M1911 pistols, the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit began looking to develop a new generation of M1911s and launched the M1911-A2 project in late 2004.[2] The goal was to produce a minimum of seven variants with various sights, internal and external extractors, flat and arched mainspring housings, integral and add-on magazine wells, a variety of finishes and other options, with the idea of providing the end-user a selection from which to select the features that best fit their missions.[2] The AMU performed a well-received demonstration of the first group of pistols to the Marine Corps at Quantico and various Special Operations units at Ft. Bragg and other locations.[2] The project provided a feasibility study with insight into future projects.[2] Models were loaned to various Special Operations units, the results of which are classified. An RFP was issued for a Joint Combat Pistol but it was ultimately canceled.[2] Currently units are experimenting with an M1911 pistol in .40 which will incorporate lessons learned from the A2 project. Ultimately, the M1911A2 project provided a test bed for improving existing M1911s. An improved M1911 variant becoming available in the future is a possibility.[2]\\r\\nThe Springfield Custom Professional Model 1911A1 pistol is produced under contract by Springfield Armory for the FBI regional SWAT teams and the Hostage Rescue Team.[32] This pistol is made in batches on a regular basis by the Springfield Custom Shop, and a few examples from most runs are made available for sale to the general public at a selling price of approximately US$2,700 each.\\r\\nSince its inception, the M1911 has lent itself to easy customization. Replacement sights, grips, and other aftermarket accessories are the most commonly offered parts. Since the 1950s and the rise of competitive pistol shooting, many companies have been offering the M1911 as a base model for major customization. These modifications can range from changing the external finish, checkering the frame, and hand fitting custom hammers, triggers, and sears. Some modifications include installing compensators and the addition of accessories such as tactical lights and even scopes.[40] A common modification of John Browning's design is to use a full-length guide rod that runs the full length of the recoil spring. This adds weight to the front of the pistol, but does not increase accuracy, and does make the pistol slightly more difficult to disassemble.[41] Custom guns can cost over $5000 and are built from the ground up or on existing base models.[42] The main companies offering custom M1911s are: Springfield Custom Shop, Ed Brown, STI International, Nighthawk Custom, Wilson Combat, and Les Baer.[citation needed] IPSC models are offered by both Strayer Voigt Inc (Infinity Firearms) and STI International.\\r\\nBrowning's basic M1911 design has seen very little change throughout its production life.[1] The basic principle of the pistol is recoil operation.[1] As the expanding combustion gases force the bullet down the barrel, they give reverse momentum to the slide and barrel which are locked together during this portion of the firing cycle. After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide and barrel continue rearward a short distance.[1]\\r\\nAt this point, a link pivots the rear of the barrel down, out of locking recesses in the slide, and the barrel is stopped by making contact with the lower barrel lugs against the frame's vertical impact surface. As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes the rear of the case, pivoting it out and away from the pistol through the ejection port. The slide stops and is then propelled forward by a spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber. At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again. However, if the fired round was the last round in the magazine, the slide will lock in the rearward position, which notifies the shooter to reload by ejecting the empty magazine and inserting a loaded magazine, and facilitates (by being rearwards) reloading the chamber, which is accomplished by either pulling the slide back slightly and releasing, or by pushing down on the slide stop, which releases the slide to move forward under spring pressure, strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber.[1]\\r\\nThere are no fasteners of any type in the 1911 design, excepting the grip screws. The main components of 1911 are held in place by the force of the recoil spring. The pistol can be \\"field stripped\\" by partially retracting the slide, removing the slide stop, and subsequently removing the barrel bushing. Full disassembly (and subsequent reassembly) of the pistol to its component parts can be accomplished using several manually removed components as tools to complete the disassembly.\\r\\nThe military mandated a grip safety and a manual safety.[1] A grip safety, sear disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located on the left rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s.[1] Several companies have developed a firing pin block safety. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith & Wesson, use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety.[43][44] Language cautioning against pulling the trigger with the second finger was included in the initial M1911 manual, and later manuals up to the 1940s.[45]\\r\\nThe same basic design has been offered commercially and has been used by other militaries. In addition to the .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), models chambered for .38 Super, 9G19mm Parabellum, 7.65mm Parabellum, 9mm Steyr,[46] .400 Corbon, and other cartridges were offered. The M1911 was developed from earlier Colt designs firing rounds such as .38 ACP. The design beat out many other contenders during the government's selection period, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, up to the pistol's adoption. The M1911 officially replaced a range of revolvers and pistols across branches of the U.S. armed forces, though a number of other designs have seen use in certain niches.[47]\\r\\nDespite being challenged by newer and lighter weight pistol designs in .45 caliber, such as the Glock 21, the SIG Sauer P220, the Springfield XD and the Heckler & Koch USP, the M1911 shows no signs of decreasing popularity and continues to be widely present in various competitive matches such as those of USPSA, IDPA, IPSC, and Bullseye.[2]\\r\\nOn March 18, 2011, the U.S. state of Utahas a way of honoring M1911 designer John Browning, who was born and raised in the stateadopted the Browning M1911 as the \\"official firearm of Utah\\".[73]","input":"Who made the first 1911 semi automatic pistol?"},{"output":"English","context":"Watson is a patronymic surname of English and Scottish origin.

The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth, according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth. The Moon's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth's gravity, therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth. This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit. Therefore, the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100% (full moon) to 0% (new moon). The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres. Each of the four \\"intermediate\\" lunar phases (see below) is roughly seven days (~7.4 days) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit. Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker, all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight, followed by 14.77 days of \\"night\\". (The side of the Moon facing away from the Earth is sometimes called the \\"dark side of the Moon\\", although that is a misnomer.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Western culture, the four principal lunar phases are new moon, first quarter, full moon, and third quarter (also known as last quarter). These are the instances when the Moon's apparent geocentric celestial longitude minus the Sun's apparent geocentric celestial longitude is 0, 90, 180 and 270, respectively.[a] Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on the Earth. During the intervals between principal phases, the Moon appears either crescent-shaped or gibbous. These shapes, and the periods of time when the Moon shows them, are called the intermediate phases. They last, on average, one-quarter of a synodic month, roughly 7.38 days, but their durations vary slightly because the Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, and thus its speed in orbit is not constant. The descriptor waxing is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon's apparent size is increasing, from new moon toward full moon, and waning when the size is decreasing.\\r\\nThe eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names, in sequential order:\\r\\nWhen the Sun and Moon are aligned on the same side of the Earth, the moon is \\"new\\", and the side of the Moon facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. As the moon waxes (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing), the lunar phases progress through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, gibbous moon, and full moon. The moon is then said to wane as it passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, crescent moon and back to new moon. The terms \\"old moon\\" and \\"new moon\\" are not interchangeable. The \\"old moon\\" is a waning sliver (which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye) until the moment it aligns with the sun and begins to wax, at which point it becomes new again.[1] Half moon is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons, while the term 'quarter' refers to the extent of the moon's cycle around the Earth, not its shape.\\r\\nWhen a sphere is illuminated on one hemisphere and viewed from a different angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle (where the major axis of the ellipse coincides with a diameter of the circle). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards)[2] whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a crescent. When a crescent Moon occurs, the phenomenon of earthshine may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon faintly reflects light from the Earth.\\r\\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, if the left side of the Moon is dark then the light part is growing, and the Moon is referred to as waxing (moving toward a full moon). If the right side of the Moon is dark then the light part is shrinking, and the Moon is referred to as waning (past full and moving toward a new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the northern hemisphere, the right portion of the Moon is the part that is always growing (i.e., if the right side is dark, the Moon is growing darker; if the right side is lit, the Moon is growing lighter).\\r\\nIn the Southern Hemisphere the Moon is observed from a perspective inverted to that of the northern hemisphere, and all of the images in this article, so that the opposite sides appear to grow (wax) and shrink (wane).\\r\\nNearer the Equator the Moon with its terminator will appear apparently horizontal during the morning and evening. Since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at temperate or high latitudes and observers moving towards the Tropics from northern or southern latitudes will see the Moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article. The crescent Moon can open upward or downward, with the \\"horns\\" of the crescent pointing up or down, respectively. When the Sun appears above the Moon in the sky, the crescent opens downward; when the Moon is above the Sun, the crescent opens upward. The crescent Moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the Sun is below the horizon, which implies that the Moon must be above the Sun, and the crescent must open upward. This is therefore the orientation in which the crescent Moon is most often seen from the Earth's tropics. The waxing and waning crescents look very similar. The waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening, and the waning crescent in the east, in the morning.\\r\\nWhen the Moon, as seen from Earth, is a narrow crescent, the Earth as seen from the Moon is almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the part of the Moon that is not directly lit by the Sun is sufficiently brightly lit by light reflected from the Earth to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called \\"earthshine\\", and is sometimes picturesquely described as \\"the old moon in the new moon's arms\\" or, as pictured here, \\"the new moon in the old moon's arms\\".\\r\\nNon-western cultures may use a different number of Moon phases, for example traditional Hawaiian culture has a total of 30 different Moon phases (one per day).[3]\\r\\nThe average calendar month, which is ?1?12 of a tropical year, is about 30.44 days, while the Moon's phase (synodic) cycle repeats on average every 29.53 days. Therefore, the timing of the Moon's phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month. (Lunar year=354 days.)\\r\\nPhotographing the Moon's phase every day for a month, starting in the evening after sunset, and repeating approximately fifty minutes later each successive day, ending in the morning before sunrise, would create a composite image like the example calendar from May 8, 2005, to June 6, 2005 here in the left. There is no picture on May 20 since a picture would be taken before midnight on May 19, and after midnight on May 21. Similarly, on a calendar listing moon rise or set times, some days will appear to be skipped. When the Moon rises just before midnight one night it will rise just after midnight the next (so too with setting). The 'skipped day' is just a feature of the moon's eastward movement in relation to the sun, which at most latitudes causes the moon to rise later each day. The moon has a predictable orbit every month.\\r\\nEach of the 4 lunar phases lasts approximately 7 days (~7.4 days), but varies slightly due to lunar apogee and perigee.\\r\\nThe approximate age of the moon, and hence the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as January 1, 1900 or August 11, 1999) and reducing this modulo 29.530588853 (the length of a synodic month). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the Julian Day Number of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since December 31, 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly circular orbit and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon happened, therefore may be incorrect by several hours (it also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date); it is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing moon phase, but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation.\\r\\nThe Earth subtends an angle of about two degrees, when seen from the Moon. This means that an observer on Earth who sees the Moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about two degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the Moon on the western horizon. The Moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day, so, if these observers were stationary, they would see the phases of the Moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day, or four hours. But in reality the observers are on the surface of the rotating Earth, so someone who sees the Moon on the eastern horizon at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later. This adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases. They appear to occur more slowly when the Moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon. The Moon appears to move jerkily, and the phases do the same. The amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours, which is a small fraction of a month. It does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the Moon. However, it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases.\\r\\nIt might be expected that once every month, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun during a new moon, its shadow would fall on Earth causing a solar eclipse, but this does not happen every month. Nor is it true that during every full moon, the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, causing a lunar eclipse. Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed every month because the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth is tilted by about 5 with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun (the plane of the ecliptic). Thus, when new and full moons occur, the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun. Although an eclipse can only occur when the Moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar), it must also be positioned very near the intersection of Earth's orbital plane about the Sun and the Moon's orbital plane about the Earth (that is, at one of its nodes). This happens about twice per year, and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year. Most of these eclipses are partial; total eclipses of the Moon or Sun are less frequent.","input":"What is the fourth phase of the moon?"},{"output":"North Carolina","context":"The Venus flytrap (also referred to as Venus's flytrap or Venus' flytrap), Dionaea muscipula, is a carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States in North Carolina and South Carolina.[3] It catches its preychiefly insects and arachnidswith a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if another contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption.\\r\\nDionaea is a monotypic genus closely related to the waterwheel plant (Aldrovanda vesiculosa) and sundews (Drosera), all of which belong to the family Droseraceae.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1759, the North Carolina colonial governor, Arthur Dobbs, penned the first written description of the plant to English botanist Peter Collinson. Brunswick, Jan. 24, 1760.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe great wonder of the vegetable kingdom is a very curious unknown species of Sensitive. It is a dwarf plant. The leaves are like a narrow segment of a sphere, consisting of two parts, like the cap of a spring purse, the concave part outwards, each of which falls back with indented edges (like an iron spring fox-trap); upon anything touching the leaves, or falling between them, they instantly close like a spring trap, and confine any insect or anything that falls between them. It bears a white flower. To this surprising plant I have given the name of Fly-trap Sensitive.\\r\\nThis seems to be the earliest notice of the plant and is before any letters from John Ellison on the subject.[7]\\r\\nThe Venus flytrap is a small plant whose structure can be described as a rosette of four to seven leaves, which arise from a short subterranean stem that is actually a bulb-like object. Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year;[8] longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering. Flytraps that have more than seven leaves are colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground.\\r\\nThe leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops;[9] two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession,[9] whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second.[10] The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are likely homologous with the tentacles found in this plants close relatives, the sundews. Scientists have concluded that the snap trap evolved from a fly-paper trap similar to that of Drosera.[11]\\r\\nThe holes in the meshwork allow small prey to escape, presumably because the benefit that would be obtained from them would be less than the cost of digesting them. If the prey is too small and escapes, the trap will usually reopen within 12 hours. If the prey moves around in the trap, it tightens and digestion begins more quickly.\\r\\nSpeed of closing can vary depending on the amount of humidity, light, size of prey, and general growing conditions. The speed with which traps close can be used as an indicator of a plant's general health. Venus flytraps are not as humidity-dependent as are some other carnivorous plants, such as Nepenthes, Cephalotus, most Heliamphora, and some Drosera.\\r\\nThe Venus flytrap exhibits variations in petiole shape and length and whether the leaf lies flat on the ground or extends up at an angle of about 40ÿ60 degrees. The four major forms are: 'typica', the most common, with broad decumbent petioles; 'erecta', with leaves at a 45-degree angle; 'linearis', with narrow petioles and leaves at 45 degrees; and 'filiformis', with extremely narrow or linear petioles. Except for 'filiformis', all of these can be stages in leaf production of any plant depending on season (decumbent in summer versus short versus semi-erect in spring), length of photoperiod (long petioles in spring versus short in summer), and intensity of light (wide petioles in low light intensity versus narrow in brighter light).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe plant's common name refers to Venus, the Roman goddess of love. The genus name, Dionaea (\\"daughter of Dione\\"), refers to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, while the species name, muscipula, is Latin for \\"mousetrap\\".[12]\\r\\nHistorically, the plant was also known by the slang term \\"tipitiwitchet\\" or \\"tippity twitchet\\", possibly an oblique reference to the plant's resemblance to human female genitalia.[12][13]\\r\\nMost carnivorous plants selectively feed on specific prey. This selection is due to the available prey and the type of trap used by the organism. With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods. In fact, the Dionaea diet is 33% ants, 30% spiders, 10% beetles, and 10% grasshoppers, with fewer than 5% flying insects.[14] Given that Dionaea evolved from an ancestral form of Drosera (carnivorous plants that use a sticky trap instead of a snap trap) the reason for this evolutionary branching becomes clear. Whilst Drosera consume smaller, aerial insects, Dionaea consume larger terrestrial bugs. Dionaea are able to extract more nutrients from these larger bugs. This gives Dionaea an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral sticky trap form.[15]\\r\\nThe Venus flytrap is one of a very small group of plants capable of rapid movement, such as Mimosa pudica, the Telegraph plant, sundews and bladderworts.\\r\\nThe mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. The trap only shuts when there have been two stimulations of the trigger hairs; this is to avoid inadvertent triggering of the mechanism by dust and other wind-borne debris. In the open, untripped state, the lobes are convex (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are concave (forming a cavity). It is the rapid flipping of this bistable state that closes the trap,[10] but the mechanism by which this occurs is still poorly understood. When the trigger hairs are stimulated, an action potential (mostly involving calcium ionssee calcium in biology) is generated, which propagates across the lobes and stimulates cells in the lobes and in the midrib between them.[16] It is hypothesized that there is a threshold of ion buildup for the Venus flytrap to react to stimulation.[17] After closing, the flytrap counts additional stimulations of the trigger hairs, to five total, to start the production of digesting enzymes.[18] The acid growth theory states that individual cells in the outer layers of the lobes and midrib rapidly move 1H+ (hydrogen ions) into their cell walls, lowering the pH and loosening the extracellular components, which allows them to swell rapidly by osmosis, thus elongating and changing the shape of the trap lobe. Alternatively, cells in the inner layers of the lobes and midrib may rapidly secrete other ions, allowing water to follow by osmosis, and the cells to collapse. Both of these mechanisms may play a role and have some experimental evidence to support them.[19][20]\\r\\nIf the prey is unable to escape, it will continue to stimulate the inner surface of the lobes, and this causes a further growth response that forces the edges of the lobes together, eventually sealing the trap hermetically and forming a \\"stomach\\" in which digestion occurs. Release of the digestive enzymes is controlled by the hormone jasmonic acid, the same hormone that triggers the release of toxins as an anti-herbivore defense mechanism in non-carnivorous plants. (See Evolution below)[18][21] Once the digestive glands in the leaf lobes have been activated, digestion is catalysed by hydrolase enzymes secreted by the glands.\\r\\nOxidative protein modification is likely to be a pre-digestive mechanism used by Dionaea muscipula. Aqueous leaf extracts have been found to contain quinones such as the naphthoquinone plumbagin that couples to different NADH-dependent diaphorases to produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide upon autoxidation.[22] Such oxidative modification could rupture animal cell membranes. Plumbagin is known to induce apoptosis, associated with the regulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins.[23] When the Dionaea extracts were pre-incubated with diaphorases and NADH in the presence of serum albumin (SA), subsequent tryptic digestion of SA was facilitated.[22] Since the secretory glands of Droseraceae contain proteases and possibly other degradative enzymes, it may be that the presence of oxygen-activating redox cofactors function as extracellular pre-digestive oxidants to render membrane-bound proteins of the prey (insects) more susceptible to proteolytic attacks.[22]\\r\\nDigestion takes about ten days, after which the prey is reduced to a husk of chitin. The trap then reopens, and is ready for reuse.[24]\\r\\nCarnivory in plants is a very specialized form of foliar feeding, and is an adaptation found in several plants that grow in nutrient-poor soil. Carnivorous traps were naturally selected to allow these organisms to compensate for the nutrient deficiencies of their harsh environments by supplementing ordinary photosynthate with animal proteins.[25]\\r\\nThe \\"snap trap\\" mechanism characteristic of Dionaea is shared with only one other carnivorous plant genus, Aldrovanda. For most of the 20th century, this relationship was thought to be coincidental, more precisely an example of convergent evolution. Some phylogenetic studies even suggested that the closest living relatives of Aldrovanda were the sundews.[26] It was not until 2002 that a molecular evolutionary study, by analyzing combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences, indicated that Dionaea and Aldrovanda were closely related and that the snap trap mechanism evolved only once in a common ancestor of the two genera.[27][28]\\r\\nA 2009 study[26] presented evidence for the evolution of snap traps of Dionaea and Aldrovanda from a flypaper trap like Drosera regia, based on molecular data. The molecular and physiological data imply that Dionaea and Aldrovanda snap traps evolved from the flypaper traps of a common ancestor with Drosera. Pre-adaptations to the evolution of snap traps were identified in several species of Drosera, such as rapid leaf and tentacle movement. The model proposes that plant carnivory by snap trap evolved from the flypaper traps, driven by increasing prey size. Bigger prey provides greater nutritional value, but large insects can easily escape the sticky mucilage of flypaper traps; the evolution of snap traps would therefore prevent escape and kleptoparasitism (theft of prey captured by the plant before it can derive benefit from it), and would also permit a more complete digestion.[26][27]\\r\\nIn 2016, a study of the expression of genes in the plant's leaves as they captured and digested prey was published in the journal, Genome Research. The gene activation observed in the leaves of the plants gives support to the hypothesis that the carnivorous mechanisms present in the flytrap are a specially adapted version of mechanisms used by non-carnivorous plants to defend against herbivorous insects.[21][29] In many non-carnivorous plants, jasmonic acid serves as a signaling molecule for the activation of defense mechanisms, such as the production of hydrolases, which can destroy chitin and other molecular components of insect and microbial pests.[30] In the Venus flytrap, this same molecule has been found to be responsible for the activation of the plant's digestive glands. A few hours after the capture of prey, another set of genes is activated inside the glands, the same set of genes that is active in the roots of other plants, allowing them to absorb nutrients. The use of similar biological pathways in the traps as non-carnivorous plants use for other purposes indicates that somewhere in its evolutionary history, the Venus flytrap repurposed these genes for the purpose of carnivory.\\r\\nCarnivorous plants are generally herbs, and their traps the result of primary growth. They generally do not form readily fossilizable structures such as thick bark or wood. As a result, there is no fossil evidence of the steps that might link Dionaea and Aldrovanda, or either genus with their common ancestor, Drosera. Nevertheless, it is possible to infer an evolutionary history based on phylogenetic studies of both genera. Researchers have proposed a series of steps that would ultimately result in the complex snap-trap mechanism:[26][27]\\r\\nThe Venus flytrap is found in nitrogen- and phosphorus-poor environments, such as bogs and wet savannahs. Small in stature and slow-growing, the Venus flytrap tolerates fire well, and depends on periodic burning to suppress its competition.[32] Fire suppression threatens its future in the wild.[33] It survives in wet sandy and peaty soils. Although it has been successfully transplanted and grown in many locales around the world, it is native only to the coastal bogs of North and South Carolina in the United States, specifically within a 60-mile radius of Wilmington, North Carolina.[34] One such place is North Carolina's Green Swamp. There also appears to be a naturalized population of Venus flytraps in northern Florida as well as an introduced population in western Washington.[35][36] The nutritional poverty of the soil is the reason that the plant relies on such elaborate traps: insect prey provide the nitrogen for protein formation that the soil cannot. The Venus flytrap is not a tropical plant and can tolerate mild winters. In fact, Venus flytraps that do not go through a period of winter dormancy will weaken and die after a period of time.[37]\\r\\nVenus flytraps are popular as cultivated plants, but have a reputation for being difficult to grow.[8] Successfully growing these specialized plants requires recreating a close approximation to the plant's natural habitat.\\r\\nHealthy Venus flytraps will produce scapes of white flowers in spring; however, many growers remove the flowering stems early (2ÿ3?inches), as flowering consumes some of the plant's energy and thereby reduces the rate of trap production. If healthy plants are allowed to flower, successful pollination will result in seeds.\\r\\nPlants can be propagated by seed, taking around four to five years to reach maturity. More commonly, they are propagated by clonal division in spring or summer. Venus flytraps can also be propagated in vitro using plant tissue culture.[38] Most Venus flytraps found for sale in nurseries garden centers have been produced using this method, as this is the most cost-effective way to propagate them on a large scale. Regardless of the propagation method used, the plants will live for 20 to 30 years if cultivated in the right conditions.[39]\\r\\nVenus flytraps are by far the most commonly recognized and cultivated carnivorous plant, and they are frequently sold as houseplants. Various cultivars (cultivated varieties) have come into the market through tissue culture of selected genetic mutations, and these plants are raised in large quantities for commercial markets.\\r\\nThe species is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" by the National Wildlife Federation.[40] In 2015, there were estimated to be fewer than 33,000 plants in the wild, all within 75 miles (121?km) of the city of Wilmington, North Carolina, and all on sites owned by The Nature Conservancy, the North Carolina state government, or the US military.[41]\\r\\nIn 2014, the state of North Carolina passed Senate Bill 734 which classifies the theft of naturally growing Venus flytraps in the state as a felony. Tougher sanctions and penalties for the theft were also enacted in December 1, 2014 in accordance with legislation.[42]\\r\\nVenus flytrap extract is available on the market as an herbal remedy, sometimes as the prime ingredient of a patent medicine named \\"Carnivora\\". According to the American Cancer Society, these products are promoted in alternative medicine as a treatment for a variety of human ailments including HIV, Crohn's disease and skin cancer, but \\"available scientific evidence does not support the health claims made for Venus flytrap extract\\".[43]","input":"Where does the venus fly trap grow naturally?"},{"output":"four-year","context":"Donovan Mitchell Jr. (born September 7, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Their release has an effect on the behavior of cells around them. It can be said that cytokines are involved in autocrine signalling, paracrine signalling and endocrine signalling as immunomodulating agents. Their definite distinction from hormones is still part of ongoing research. Cytokines include chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines, and tumour necrosis factors but generally not hormones or growth factors (despite some overlap in the terminology). Cytokines are produced by a broad range of cells, including immune cells like macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and mast cells, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and various stromal cells; a given cytokine may be produced by more than one type of cell.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThey act through receptors, and are especially important in the immune system; cytokines modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses, and they regulate the maturation, growth, and responsiveness of particular cell populations. Some cytokines enhance or inhibit the action of other cytokines in complex ways.[3]\\r\\nThey are different from hormones, which are also important cell signaling molecules, in that hormones circulate in less variable concentrations and hormones tend to be made by specific kinds of cells.\\r\\nThey are important in health and disease, specifically in host responses to infection, immune responses, inflammation, trauma, sepsis, cancer, and reproduction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInterferon-alpha, an interferon type I, was identified in 1957 as a protein that interfered with viral replication.[4] The activity of interferon-gamma (the sole member of the interferon type II class) was described in 1965; this was the first identified lymphocyte-derived mediator.[4] Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was identified simultaneously in 1966 by John David and Barry Bloom.[4]\\r\\nIn 1969 Dudley Dumonde proposed the term \\"lymphokine\\" to describe proteins secreted from lymphocytes and later, proteins derived from macrophages and monocytes in culture were called \\"monokines\\". As scientists learned more, it was understood that these proteins and others were part of a broader class of proteins involved in self-defense, and should be called \\"cytokines\\".[4]\\r\\nClassic hormones circulate in nanomolar (10-9 M) concentrations that usually vary by less than one order of magnitude. In contrast, some cytokines (such as IL-6) circulate in picomolar (10-12 M) concentrations that can increase up to 1,000-fold during trauma or infection. The widespread distribution of cellular sources for cytokines may be a feature that differentiates them from hormones. Virtually all nucleated cells, but especially endo/epithelial cells and resident macrophages (many near the interface with the external environment) are potent producers of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-ϫ.[5] In contrast, classic hormones, such as insulin, are secreted from discrete glands (e.g., the pancreas).[6] As of 2008, the current terminology refers to cytokines as immunomodulating agents. However, more research is needed in this area of defining cytokines and hormones.\\r\\nPart of the difficulty with distinguishing cytokines from hormones is that some of the immunomodulating effects of cytokines are systemic rather than local. For instance, to use hormone terminology, the action of cytokines may be autocrine or paracrine in chemotaxis or chemokinesis and endocrine as a pyrogen. Further, as molecules, cytokines are not limited to their immunomodulatory role.\\r\\nCytokines have been classed as lymphokines, interleukins, and chemokines, based on their presumed function, cell of secretion, or target of action. Because cytokines are characterised by considerable redundancy and pleiotropism, such distinctions, allowing for exceptions, are obsolete.\\r\\nStructural homogeneity has been able to partially distinguish between cytokines that do not demonstrate a considerable degree of redundancy so that they can be classified into four types:\\r\\nA classification that proves more useful in clinical and experimental practice outside of structural biology divides immunological cytokines into those that enhance cellular immune responses, type 1 (TNFϫ, IFN-, etc.), and type 2 (TGF-, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, etc.), which favor antibody responses.\\r\\nA key focus of interest has been that cytokines in one of these two sub-sets tend to inhibit the effects of those in the other. Dysregulation of this tendency is under intensive study for its possible role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders.\\r\\nSeveral inflammatory cytokines are induced by oxidative stress.[7][8] The fact that cytokines themselves trigger the release of other cytokines[9][10][11] and also lead to increased oxidative stress makes them important in chronic inflammation, as well as other immunoresponses, such as fever and acute phase proteins of the liver (IL-1,6,12, IFN-a).\\r\\nCytokines also play a role in anti-inflammatory pathways and are a possible therapeutic treatment for pathological pain from inflammation or peripheral nerve injury.[12] There are both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that regulate this pathway.\\r\\nIn recent years, the cytokine receptors have come to demand the attention of more investigators than cytokines themselves, partly because of their remarkable characteristics, and partly because a deficiency of cytokine receptors has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states. In this regard, and also because the redundancy and pleomorphism of cytokines are, in fact, a consequence of their homologous receptors, many authorities think that a classification of cytokine receptors would be more clinically and experimentally useful.\\r\\nA classification of cytokine receptors based on their three-dimensional structure has, therefore, been attempted. Such a classification, though seemingly cumbersome, provides several unique perspectives for attractive pharmacotherapeutic targets.\\r\\nEach cytokine has a matching cell-surface receptor. Subsequent cascades of intracellular signalling then alter cell functions. This may include the upregulation and/or downregulation of several genes and their transcription factors, resulting in the production of other cytokines, an increase in the number of surface receptors for other molecules, or the suppression of their own effect by feedback inhibition.\\r\\nThe effect of a particular cytokine on a given cell depends on the cytokine, its extracellular abundance, the presence and abundance of the complementary receptor on the cell surface, and downstream signals activated by receptor binding; these last two factors can vary by cell type. Cytokines are characterized by considerable \\"redundancy\\", in that many cytokines appear to share similar functions.\\r\\nIt seems to be a paradox that cytokines binding to antibodies have a stronger immune effect than the cytokine alone. This may lead to lower therapeutic doses.\\r\\nSaid et al. showed that inflammatory cytokines cause an IL-10-dependent inhibition of[14] T-cell expansion and function by up-regulating PD-1 levels on monocytes which leads to IL-10 production by monocytes after binding of PD-1 by PD-L.[14]\\r\\nAdverse reactions to cytokines are characterized by local inflammation and/or ulceration at the injection sites. Occasionally such reactions are seen with more widespread papular eruptions.[15]\\r\\nCytokines are often involved in several developmental processes during embryogenesis.[16][nb 1][17][nb 2]\\r\\nCytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and in other immune responses.[18] However, they can become dysregulated and pathological in inflammation, trauma, and sepsis.[18]\\r\\nAdverse effects of cytokines have been linked to many disease states and conditions ranging from schizophrenia, major depression[19] and Alzheimer's disease[20] to cancer.[21] Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines; disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity.[22] Over-secretion of cytokines can trigger a dangerous syndrome known as a cytokine storm; this may have been the cause of severe adverse events during a clinical trial of TGN1412. Cytokine storms are suspected to be the main cause of death in the 1918 \\"Spanish Flu\\" pandemic. Deaths were weighted more heavily towards people with healthy immune systems, due to its ability to produce stronger immune responses, likely increasing cytokine levels. Another important example of cytokine storm is seen in acute pancreatitis. Cytokines are integral and implicated in all angles of the cascade resulting in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multi organ failure associated with this intra-abdominal catastrophe.[23]\\r\\nSome cytokines have been developed into protein therapeutics using recombinant DNA technology.[24] Recombinant cytokines being used as drugs as of 2014 include:[25]\\r\\nPlasma levels of various cytokines may give information on the presence, or even predictive value of inflammatory processes involved in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,[28] as well as immunomodulatory effects of foods or drugs.[29] In addition, elevated levels of IL-7, an important cytokine involved in T cell homeostasis, have been detected in the plasma of HIV-infected patients.[30]","input":"What are the main sources of immune system cytokines?"},{"output":"CoCl2{6H2O","context":"Cobalt(II) chloride is an inorganic compound of cobalt and chlorine, with the formula CoCl2.

Because of the ease of the hydration/dehydration reaction, and the resulting color change, cobalt chloride is used as an indicator for water in desiccants.\\r\\nNiche uses of cobalt chloride include its role in organic synthesis and electroplating objects with cobalt metal.\\r\\nCobalt chloride has been classified as a substance of very high concern by the European Chemicals Agency as it is a suspected carcinogen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAqueous solutions of both CoCl2 and the hydrate contain the species [Co(H2O)6]2+. They also contain chloride ions. Solid CoCl2{6H2O consists of the molecule trans-[CoCl2(H2O)4] and two molecules of water of crystallization.[3] This species dissolves readily in water and alcohol. Concentrated aqueous solutions are red at room temperature but become blue at higher temperatures.[4] CoCl2{6H2O is deliquescent, and the anhydrous salt CoCl2 is hygroscopic.\\r\\nHydrated cobalt chloride is prepared from cobalt(II) hydroxide or cobalt(II) carbonate and hydrochloric acid:\\r\\nUpon heating, the hexahydrate dehydrates.[5] Dehydration can also be effected with trimethylsilyl chloride:[6]\\r\\nGenerally, aqueous solutions of cobalt(II) chlorides behave like other cobalt(II) salts since these solutions consist of the [Co(H2O)6]2+ ion regardless of the anion. Such solutions give a precipitate of CoS upon treatment with H2S. CoCl2{6H2O and CoCl2 are weak Lewis acids. The adducts are usually either octahedral or tetrahedral. With pyridine (C\\r\\n5H\\r\\n5N), one obtains the octahedral complex:\\r\\nWith triphenylphosphine (P(C\\r\\n6H\\r\\n5)\\r\\n3), a tetrahedral complex results:\\r\\nSalts of the anionic complex CoCl42? can be prepared using tetraethylammonium chloride:[7]\\r\\nThe [CoCl4]2? ion is the blue ion that forms upon addition of hydrochloric acid to aqueous solutions of hydrated cobalt chloride, which are pink.\\r\\nIn the laboratory, cobalt(II) chloride serves as a common precursor to other cobalt compounds. Reaction of the anhydrous compound with sodium cyclopentadienide gives cobaltocene. This 19-electron species is a good reducing agent, being readily oxidised to the yellow 18-electron cobaltacenium cation. Reaction of 1-norbonyllithium with the CoCl2{THF in pentane produces the brown, thermally stable cobalt(IV) tetralkyl[8][9]  a rare example of a stable transition metal/saturated alkane compound,[2] different products are obtained in other solvents.[10]\\r\\nIn the presence of ammonia or amines, cobalt(II) is readily oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to give a variety of cobalt(III) complexes. For example, the presence of ammonia triggers the oxidation of cobalt(II) chloride to hexamminecobalt(III) chloride:\\r\\nThe reaction is often performed in the presence of charcoal as a catalyst, or hydrogen peroxide is employed in place of air. Other highly basic ligands including carbonate, acetylacetonate, and oxalate induce the formation of Co(III) derivatives. Simple carboxylates and halides do not.\\r\\nUnlike Co(II) complexes, Co(III) complexes are very slow to exchange ligands, so they are said to be kinetically inert. The German chemist Alfred Werner was awarded the Nobel prize in 1913 for his studies on a series of these cobalt(III) compounds, work that led to an understanding of the structures of such coordination compounds.\\r\\nThe existence of cobalt(III) chloride, CoCl3, is disputed, although this compound is listed in some compendia.[11] According to Greenwood and Earnshaw, the only stable binary compounds of cobalt and the halogens, excluding CoF3, are the dihalides.[2] Stated differently, CoCl2 is unreactive toward Cl2[citation needed]. The stability of Co (III) in solution is considerably increased in the presence of ligands of greater Lewis basicity than chloride, such as amines.\\r\\nIn 2005ÿ06, cobalt chloride was the eighth-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (8.4%).[12]","input":"What is the formula of cobalt(ii) chloride hexahydrate?"},{"output":"one year of full-time study (or equivalent) at a university or other higher education institution, or two years of part-time study","context":"A Certificate of Higher Education (Cert.H.E./CertHE) is a higher education qualification in the United Kingdom.[1]\\r\\nIt is awarded after one year of full-time study (or equivalent) at a university or other higher education institution, or two years of part-time study.[1][2] A Cert.HE is an independent tertiary award, an award in its own right, and students can study for a Cert.HE in various academic disciplines.

Based on volume sold in 2016, Yuengling was the top craft beer company in the U.S.[2] Based on sales in 2011, Yuengling was tied with the Boston Beer Company, maker of Samuel Adams brands, as the largest American-owned brewery.[3] Its headquarters are in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.[4] Yuengling produces about 2.8 million barrels annually, operating two Pennsylvania facilities and a brewery in Tampa, Florida.\\r\\nYuengling is pronounced /?j??l??/?(?listen) YENG-ling,[citation needed] and is an Anglicized version of Jngling, its founder's surname and the German term for \\"youngling\\" or \\"young person\\".\\r\\nThe family-owned brewery has traditionally changed ownership through the purchase of the company by the offspring of the previous owner.[5] Due to the popularity of Yuengling Traditional Lager in Pennsylvania and the Delaware Valley (including South Jersey), it can in some bars be ordered by simply asking for a lager.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman brewer David Gottlieb Jngling (1808ÿ1877) immigrated to the United States in 1828 from Aldingen, a suburb of Stuttgart, in the Kingdom of Wrttemberg. He anglicized his surname from Jngling to Yuengling and began the \\"Eagle Brewery\\" on Center Street in Pottsville in 1829.[9] His eldest son David Jr. left the Eagle Brewery to establish the James River Steam Brewery along the James River in Richmond, Virginia.[10] The first brewery burned down in an 1831 fire and the company relocated to W. Mahantongo Street at 5th Street, its current location.[11] The Eagle Brewery changed its name to \\"D. G. Yuengling and Son\\" in 1873 after Frederick Yuengling joined his father David in running the company. Although the company's name changed, the bald eagle remained the company's emblem. During the late 19th century, breweries were also opened in Saratoga Springs, New York City, and Trail, British Columbia, although they were eventually merged with the Pottsville plant.[10]\\r\\nFrank D. Yuengling began heading the company in 1899 after his father Frederick died.[5] During the Prohibition era, Yuengling survived by producing \\"near beers\\" (beverages with a 0.5% alcohol content) called \\"Yuengling Special\\", \\"Yuengling Por-Tor\\", and \\"Yuengling Juvo\\".[10] The company also ran a dairy which produced ice cream and opened dance halls in Philadelphia and New York City.[5] In 1933 when the nation's breweries and disgruntled beer lovers finally won the fight against Prohibition, Yuengling introduced its symbolic Winner Beer, celebrating Prohibition's repeal, and the brewery shipped a truck load of its popular brew to the White House to show their appreciation to President Roosevelt.[12] Richard L. Yuengling Sr. and F. Dohrman Yuengling succeeded Frank Yuengling after their father's death in 1963.[13]\\r\\nYuengling experienced an increase of sales after a renewed interest in history owing to the United States Bicentennial in 1976.[5] Yuengling bought the rights to use the Mount Carbon (Bavarian Premium Beer) name and label when Mount Carbon Brewery went out of business in 1977. Yuengling initially brewed beer at Mount Carbon but eventually abandoned it. The dairy remained in business until 1985.\\r\\nRichard L.

(The company's website mentions only a vague national and state registration in 1976).[13] Yuengling has been a registered trademark for a variety of merchandise, including beer, since 1995.[15] The Pottsville brewery was featured on an episode of The History Channel's American Eats.\\r\\nIn 1987, the brewery reintroduced a lager they had not made in decades to take advantage of a spike in popularity of heavier-style beers. Since this time, Yuengling Lager has become its flagship brand, accounting for 80% of production and much of its rapid growth.[16] In 1990, the brewery sold 138,000 barrels. [17] At the time, Yuengling was the largest brewer of porter in the United States.[17]\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, demand throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware outstripped the existing brewery's abilities. In 1999, they increased their manufacturing capacity by purchasing a Stroh Brewery Company plant in Tampa, Florida, hiring the former Stroh employees, and began working with a trade union for the first time.[5] In 2000, the company built a third brewery in Pennsylvania, in Port Carbon in Schuylkill County near Pottsville. With production at the Port Carbon, Tampa, and original Pottsville plants, the company has been able to expand throughout the East Coast.\\r\\nYuengling employees filed for union decertification in 2006. As a result, Yuengling did not renew a contract with Teamsters Local 830 of Philadelphia in March 2006.[18][19] In response, the trade union began boycotting Yuengling products.[20]\\r\\nAs of 2017, Yuengling is a moderately priced beer popular northward through New York, westward until Illinois and Kentucky, and southward through Georgia, where it has a large following. The Tampa brewery supplies the Florida Gulf Coast, the Florida Keys, Central Florida, North Florida, the Florida Panhandle as well as Alabama and Tennessee. The brewery uses corn from Minnesota and hops from Washington as ingredients in its products. Yuengling beer returned to Massachusetts on March 3, 2014, after having circulated among some bars and restaurants beginning in February.[21]\\r\\nYuengling began distribution in the state of Georgia on October 27, 2008.

The team played its home matches at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur and also had secondary home grounds at the Sardar Patel Stadium at Ahmedabad and the Brabourne Stadium at Mumbai.\\r\\nThe Royals are sometimes considered the Moneyball team of the IPL.[2][3][4] The Royals are known to unearth obscure, high potential talent.[5][6][7] The team won the inaugural edition of the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne, despite being written off as a title contender by the media and fans. The Royals were also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 under Rahul Dravid's captaincy.[7][8]\\r\\nOn 14 July 2015 the verdict reached by a panel appointed by India's Supreme Court suspended Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years over a corruption and match fixing scandal, meaning they could not participate in both the 2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. They returned to the competition for the 2018 season.\\r\\nThe team's record run-scorer and current captain is Ajinkya Rahane, with 2705 runs [9], while the leading wicket-taker is Shane Watson, with 67 [10].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced in September 2007 the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[11] In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The team is one of the eight founding members of the IPL in 2008. The Jaipur franchise was sold to the Emerging Media for $67 million, making it the least expensive team in the league.[1]\\r\\nThe franchise is currently owned and chaired by Manoj Badale. Other investors include Lachlan Murdoch, Aditya S Chellaram, and Suresh Chellaram. The Group acquired the franchise for $67million.[12] Incidentally, this was the least expensive franchise in the Indian Premier League and probably the least fancied team in the league at the beginning of the tournament.[13] It made a pre-tax profit of $7.5 million in 2009.[14]\\r\\nIn 2010, the BCCI decided to expel Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals from the IPL. The expulsion baffled captain Shane Warne who stated that he suspected that there might be some foul play and that the BCCI might possess some ulterior motives.[15] The Rajasthan Royals however filed an appeal against the decision and the two parties went to the Mumbai High Court to decide[16] The Mumbai high-court adjourned that case until 29 October 2010.[17] Both parties then agreed to adjourn the case again to 15 November because they didn't want it to coincide with Diwali celebrations from 1 to 14 November[18] Later it was announced by the Royals that they told the Bombay High Court that they would be negotiating with an arbitrator to see if they could reconcile with the IPL[19] The arbitrator announced that while the investigation was ongoing the Royals would remain a part of the IPL for six-weeks and the BCCI would not be allowed to change rules which might go against the Royals. The six-week period included the player auction in which Rajasthan Royals participated.[20] After this the Bombay High Court rejected the appeals of the BCCI against keeping the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL for six-weeks while the case was sorted out.[21] It was estimated because of the losses in court cases and damaging reputation the BCCI decided not to pursue any further legal action against Royals' or Kings XI Punjab and announced they decided to keep them in the IPL.[22]\\r\\nIn 2015 the team was banned for two years following the Lodha Panel inquiry.[23]\\r\\nRajasthan Royals became the source of controversy when inappropriate and fictitious bids were made, violating BCCI norms.[24] Ranjit Barthakur and Fraser Castellino were the only two shareholders of the Jaipur IPL, completely unknown to the BCCI at the time.[25][26] An out of court settlement between the two later ensued.[27] In 2015 Rajasthan Royals were banned for two years by the BCCI, with its owner Raj Kundra[28][better?source?needed] banned for life.[29]\\r\\nPrior to the start of the inaugural IPL season, many considered the Royals as possibly the weakest team in the IPL, giving them little chance of competing well in the tournament.[30] Evidence of the latter opinion seemed to be confirmed when the team lost its first match against the Delhi Daredevils in a 9 wicket loss.[31] The fears were confirmed that the team was likely to struggle, but no one had ever thought that this was the beginning of a new dawn for the team. But the team believed in writing their own script and there was something about their style of cricket, perhaps the simple attitude with which they approached the game. This simplicity was bought about largely by Warne's captaincy, as he never had the fear to lose and was always calm in dealing with his players and pressure situations.[32]\\r\\nIn their first home game ever at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, they played against the Kings XI Punjab and won by 6 wickets as Shane Watson was declared the man of the match for his unbeaten 76 off 49 balls in what was a successful run chase. That was followed by a crucial 3 wicket win against one of the favorites to win the competition, Deccan Chargers in Hyderabad. The victory proved to be a huge morale booster for the side since this was their first away win and second successful run chase on the trot, as Yusuf Pathan made a name for himself with his first man of the match award for his bowling figures of 2/20 in 4 overs and a 28-ball 61.\\r\\nWatson almost replicated Yusuf's all-round performance in the following match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore as another run chase was completed. In the 7 wicket victory, Watto picked 2/20 in 4 overs and smashed 61 not out off 41 balls. Their next game was another crucial one, against the Kolkata Knight Riders at home and Rajasthan won convincingly by 45 runs as the diminutive opener from Goa, Swapnil Asnodkar received his first man of the match award for a fine knock of 60 off just 34 balls.\\r\\nThey further managed to defeat the Chennai Super Kings in Jaipur, as Pakistan's Sohail Tanvir continued to show his red hot bowling form in the game, picking 6 wickets for 14 runs in 4 overs, winning the man of the match award for the same. But a minor hiccup followed, as they were thrashed by 7 wickets by the unpredictable Mumbai Indians in Navi Mumbai.\\r\\nHowever the Royals won their next game by defeating the Kings XI Punjab and continued to win the next five games in a row. The Royals built up an impressive 11ÿ3 record after their fourteen preliminary round matches; this included a consecutive 5-game and 6-game winning streak with an undefeated record on their home ground and a spot at the top of the points table. They were also the first team to book a place in the semifinals with their 65 run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore.\\r\\nDeccan Chargers were denied their first victory against the Rajasthan Royals, once again due to the burly Yusuf Pathan, who won his second man of the match award for his 37-ball 68 as Rajasthan prevailed by 8 wickets at home. There were two more home games on the trot, as the Delhi Daredevils were beaten this time by 3 wickets with Watto again performing his all-round magic to bewilder the opposition, as he ended with 2/21 in 4 overs and hit a 40-ball 74 to guide the chase adequately enough in the end. Whereas, the Royal Challengers Bangalore were thrashed by 65 runs, as South Africa's captain Graeme Smith won the man of the match award for his unbeaten 49-ball 75.\\r\\nTheir next challenge was to conquer the nerves which can be developed when playing at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. But the home team was given a proper thumping by Yusuf Pathan who hammered an unbeaten 48 off just 18 balls, and backed it with bowling figures of 1/14 in 2 overs as Rajasthan Royals won by 6 wickets. They were however, given a tough fight by the Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in their 10-run victory.\\r\\nFollowed by which, their last home game of the season was against the Mumbai Indians and Warne's boys ensured that they remained at the top of the points table in the conclusion of the round robin stage, with a 5-wicket win as Tanvir once again was devastating, picking 4/14 in his 4 overs. They did lose to the Kings XI Punjab in the final round robin game, but easily made it to the semifinals and Sohail Tanvir won the first ever Purple Cap in IPL history, for taking the most number of wickets in the tournament.\\r\\nShane Warne's captaincy and simultaneous coaching was praised and well received by everyone,[33][34] including opposition teams.[35] In addition, several players of the Royals team had consistently played well. Their semifinal was against the Delhi Daredevils in Mumbai, which was expected to be a tough contest for them. Yet, Delhi were walloped by 105 runs as Watto made this a one-sided contest following his 29-ball 52 and 3/10 in 3 overs, hence continuing his purple patch in the competition and assuring a place for Rajasthan in the final against MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings in the same city.\\r\\nThe final was a cliffhanger, which was ideal to end the first ever IPL tournament. Chennai could play their best possible to attempt stopping an in-form Rajasthan Royals. Although their team total after 20 overs was around 150, they took the match till the final ball until appropriately. With the scores level with one ball remaining, it was their bowling hero Sohail Tanvir who hit the winning runs to ensure that Rajasthan were crowned the champions of the first season of the IPL, making history in the process. Yusuf Pathan was declared the man of the match in the final as well, for his figures of 3/22 in 4 overs and 56 runs and thus became a household name ever since, beating the popularity of his younger brother Irfan Pathan and going on to represent India in the shorter formats of the game.[36]\\r\\nThe all-rounder Shane Watson won the man of the tournament award for scoring as many as 472 runs and picking 17 wickets. This was able to make him cement his spot in all formats of the game in the Australian team, and has now become one of the most valuable T20 players in world cricket. It was an incredible victory for an underdog team which had inexperienced, young Indian cricketers mostly who could mainly speak in their mother tongues, which Warne could not understand.\\r\\nRajasthan Royals qualified for the Champions League T20 that year, but the event was cancelled on the account of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. The Rajasthan Royals became the winner of the first IPL tournament, when they defeated the Chennai Super Kings by 3 wickets in the final played on 1 June 2008. With the scores level with one ball remaining, Sohail Tanvir scored the winning run and therefore prevented the match from being decided on a bowl out.[36]\\r\\nEach player and representative on the team was awarded a medal and the team was presented with the DLF Indian Premier League trophy along with a cheque for US$1.2 million prize money. Many of the Royals' players also took home individual awards for their performance during the tournament; Yusuf Pathan claimed the Man of the Match award for the final match, Sohail Tanvir~ finished the tournament in possession of the Purple Cap (the IPL's leading wicket taker) and Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was declared the Man of the Series.\\r\\nThe Royals came into the tournament in South Africa as the defending champions, but not one of the favourites since Sohail Tanvir was ineligible to play for the team due to the ban imposed by the BCCI on Pakistani players playing in the competition. As well as the fact that Shane Watson, theiaround was unavailable for the whole season as Australia toured to UAE for ODI series against Pakistan. Without these two, the team looked slightly weaker than the previous season and players such as the countryman Graeme Smith, fiery pacer Shaun Tait and the aging Shane Warne had to be relied on.[37]\\r\\nRajasthan began their 2009 campaign against the Royal Challengers Bangalore solemnly. They were bowled out for the Second lowest score (First lowest score is of RCB against KKR in 2017 they made a score of 49 and were all out) in the history of the IPL, a paltry 58 as they were thrashed by 75 runs in Newlands, Cape Town by the Kevin Pietersen-led side. They made a short trip to Durban to play the Mumbai Indians but that match was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan go at the bottom of the points table at that stage.\\r\\nBut on their return to Cape Town, they faced the Kolkata Knight Riders in a match which went to the Super Over, and Rajasthan were only able to win due to Yusuf Pathan's onslaught off the bowling of Ajantha Mendis, knocking off the required 17 runs in just 4 balls. At the same ground although, they were defeated by the Kings XI Punjab by 27 runs.\\r\\nYusuf again played a blinder of an innings, an unbeaten 30-ball 62 to help Rajasthan Royals beat Delhi Daredevils yet again, by 5 wickets. But the team that they met in the final last season, Chennai Super Kings was too good for them in their first clash of the season in Pretoria where Chennai won by 38 runs.\\r\\nHowever, Yusuf was at his all-round best as the Royals beat the Deccan Chargers by 3 wickets as he bowled well in his 4 overs, with figures of 1/19 and contributing 24 runs off 17 balls. They also were able to hammer Kings XI Punjab by 78 runs in their return match in Durban as Graeme Smith made the decibel levels on the ground increase with his 44-ball 77. Whereas, they took their revenge against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, prevailing by 7 wickets as the team rode on the unknown Indian pacer, Amit Singh's spell of 4/19 in 4 overs.\\r\\nThen disaster struck. They lost yet another contest to the Chennai Super Kings, by 7 wickets and Deccan Chargers posted their first win against the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, by a massive margin of 53 runs. The Royals managed to shut out the Mumbai Indians by a mere 2 runs due to Warne's brilliance but were knocked out of the tournament with back-to-back defeats to the Delhi Daredevils by 14 runs and the bottom-ranked Kolkata Knight Riders by 3 wickets.\\r\\nSeven players were dropped from the team and they were sent back to home. These players were ÿ Mohammed Kaif, Dinesh Salunkhe, Paras Dogra, Anup Revandkar, Srideep Mangela, Ashraf Makda and Azhar Malik.[38]\\r\\nRajasthan Royals ended 6th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 matches out of the 14 they played. The Royals failed to make it to the semifinals after losing their last two matches against Delhi Daredevils and Kolkata Knight Riders. It was a disappointing finish for Warne's boys, who had won many hearts with their 2008 performance.[39]\\r\\nOn 14 May 2009 it was announced that Rajasthan Royals would meet Middlesex Crusaders in a one-off Twenty20 for the British Asian Cup. It was the first time that an annual charity series to be played between the Twenty20 champions of the two countries. The match took place on 6 July 2009. The Squads were announced on 3 July 2009 with Rajasthan Royals included Mohammad Kaif and also saw a comeback of Sohail Tanvir.\\r\\nThe match was won by Rajasthan Royals by 46 runs after scoring 162/5 in 20 overs and successfully defending it by 46 runs (Middlesex 116/7). The MoM was Dimitri Mascarenhas.[40]\\r\\nThe Royals were back in India after their average outing in South Africa. This time they seemed to be a better outfit as they were to play in conditions which should have suited them the most. But they had to suffer an unfortunate start to the competition, with a narrow 4 run defeat to the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. The highlight of this match though, was Yusuf Pathan hitting the fastest ever hundred in IPL history, off only 37 balls! Even some of the Mumbai fans were disappointed not to see Rajasthan win, by the end of it all.[32]\\r\\nThey went on to lose to the Delhi Daredevils by 6 wickets on one of their new home grounds, Ahmedabad. And were again bruised badly by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who won by 10 wickets. The team remained inconsistent throughout the whole season, winning their next four matches consecutively. One of the young Turks of the erstwhile ICL, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala impressed against the franchise representing his home state, Kolkata Knight Riders as his 36-ball 45 helped the Royals win by 34 runs.\\r\\nFollowed by which the Western Australian batsman Adam Voges hit 45 runs off 24 balls to help Rajasthan beat Punjab in Mohali by 31 runs. The team seemed to have adapted to the Ahmedabad conditions better with wins against Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets as Yusuf Pathan continued his good form against the team, while they beat Chennai Super Kings by 17 runs courtesy wicket-keeper batsman Naman Ojha's 49-ball 80.\\r\\nBut they lost against Chennai in their return clash as Murali Vijay's hundred took the game away from them as well as were crushed in Delhi by 67 runs. But they managed to escape a Deccan Chargers attack, with a narrow 2 run victory in Nagpur and continued their unbeaten run in Jaipur though, as the out of sorts Kings XI Punjab were duly beaten by 9 wickets with English opener Michael Lumb winning the man of the match award for his 43-ball 83.\\r\\nOnce again, Rajasthan Royals ended the tournament miserably with losses to Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore at home, and the Kolkata Knight Riders in the last round robin game in Kolkata. Consequently, they failed to make it to the playoffs for the second consecutive season as they finished 7th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 games out of 14 played.[32]\\r\\nThe Rajasthan Royals, and the Kings XI Punjab were temporarily ejected from the league due to issues with their unreported ownership changes. The teams were reinstated with involvement from the High Court.[41] Their owners were broken into several legal entities when the BCCI required the incorporation of the companies.[42][43] Kochi was also at risk of ejection for the same reasons before BCCI cleared their new ownership pattern for the tournament.[44]\\r\\nThe team management decided to retain the Australian duo of Shane Warne and Shane Watson for the following three seasons of the IPL, although Warne's future continued to be uncertain. Yet, he decided to make this his final season for the Rajasthan Royals on the insistence of the team owners who felt that he was the ultimate source of inspiration for the team on and off the field.\\r\\nIn the auction, the team's funds were reduced since they were penalised by the BCCI in 2010 and as a result, had to pay a certain amount of bank guarantee as fixed by the High Court. But they possessed an adequate amount of money to buy some of the world's finest T20 players, which they did not exactly.\\r\\nThey managed to buy back Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait for US$ 300,000 as well as South African bowling all-rounder Johan Botha for US$ 950,000. The other star players which they picked were New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor for US$ 1 million as well as The Wall Rahul Dravid for half that price. England's World T20 2010 winning skipper Paul Collingwood was also purchased for a mere US$ 250,000. The other players were mostly from the domestic circuits, but were confident individuals following Rajasthan winning the Ranji Trophy that year.\\r\\nRajasthan Royals began the IPL 2011 in grand fashion, beating the Kumar Sangakkara-led Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets, with the young Indian pacer Siddharth Trivedi adjudged the man of the match for his spell of 3/15 and the Royals continued their fine record against the Chargers. While Shane Warne defied age with a fine piece of bowling to assist Rajasthan in defeating a weakened Delhi Daredevils side by 6 wickets, with figures of 2/17.\\r\\nHowever, their confidence was dented with two back-to-back defeats to the new look Kolkata Knight Riders in a span of three days. In the clash at Jaipur, they lost by 9 wickets courtesy a 100-run partnership between Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, Whereas in Kolkata, Lakshmipathy Balaji picked 3/15 in 4 overs on a minefield pitch in Eden Gardens to help his team pull of an 8 wicket victory.\\r\\nThe match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan's task of making it into the last four much tougher. Shaun Marsh was in great nick and his 42-ball 71 resulted in the Royals losing to Kings XI Punjab in Mohali by 48 runs. However, they pulled together a string of a hat-trick of home wins, as Rajasthan chased successfully in all the three matches. The first was against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, winning by 8 wickets. Followed by Mumbai Indians, the No.1 team then on the points table as they chased down a total of 100 with 7 wickets to spare. And then the Pune Warriors India were undone by Ross Taylors 35-ball 47 not out, as Rajasthan won by 6 wickets.\\r\\nBut again it was inconsistency which let the Royals down badly. They were given a proper thumping by the eventual champions Chennai Super Kings in both the matches they played against each other, within a span of five days. The in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore thrashed them by 9 wickets courtesy Chris Gayle while they were bowled out for 97 in their 8-wicket defeat to the Kochi Tuskers Kerala.\\r\\nAlthough this time they ended their round robin matches well with a win against the Mumbai Indians in Mumbai and in the process giving Shane Warne a fitting farewell, Rajasthan were dismissed from the competition since they ended at the 6th position out of the 10 teams in the tournament, having again won 6 out of their 14 matches played, with one being a no result.[32]\\r\\nRajasthan Royals finished in seventh place among the point table in season 5 of IPL winning only seven matches out of sixteen.[45]\\r\\nRajasthan Royals qualified for the playoff stage by finishing third in the group stage, thus grabbing a spot in Champions League 2013. They won against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the eliminator but lost to Mumbai Indians in the second qualifier, which led to their exit from the tournament.[46][47] Shane Watson was declared the Man of the tournament.\\r\\nOn 16 May 2013, three Rajasthan Royals players Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were arrested from Mumbai by Delhi Police along with eleven bookies on charges of spot-fixing in the tournament. The fixing happened in the matches against Pune Warriors on 5 May, Kings XI Punjab on 9 May and Mumbai Indians on 15 May.[48] Later BCCI suspended the three players.[49]\\r\\nRajasthan Royals retained five players ÿ Sanju Samson, Ajinkya Rahane, Shane Watson, James Faulkner and Stuart Binny ÿ for the seventh season of the IPL. Rajasthan Royals scored 65 runs off the last 17 balls at a strike rate of 382.35 to win the match against RCB.[50] Shane Watson lead the side and Rahul Dravid played the role of a mentor.[51][52]\\r\\nIn 2018, the Rajasthan Royals made a comeback to IPL after two years of suspension. Prior to the 2018 IPL auction, the Royals retained Steve Smith for ?12 crore (US$1.8?million) announcing him as captain for 2018 season.[53] Following the ball tampering controversy in March 2018, Smith stepped down as Royals captain with Ajinkya Rahane appointed. Smith was subsequently banned from playing in the 2018 IPL season.[54][55][56][57] Following Steve Smith's ban Heinrich Klaasen was announced as replacement.\\r\\nOn 2 May 2018, in a match against the Delhi Daredevils, Jos Buttler scored the fastest ever 50 for Rajasthan Royals, off just 18 balls. This was also the fifth fastest in IPL history. However, RR lost the match by four runs after failing to make the revised target of 151 from 12 overs due to rain. Buttler also equalled Virender Sehwags record for most consecutive fifties in the IPL, with 5 consecutive fifties.\\r\\nThe Royals managed to secure fourth place in the regular season, with 14 points. However, they crashed out of the playoffs in the eliminator against Kolkata Knight Riders, losing by 25 runs in Eden Gardens.\\r\\nThe team anthem is 'Halla Bol'. In the first IPL season the song was sung by Ila Arun.[58] While in second season, it was sung by huudiya.[59]Currently, this team's anthem is 'Phir Halla Bol', released in 2018.\\r\\nThe team's mascot is a lion named Moochu Singh.[30]\\r\\nTraditionally, the Rajasthan Royals usually purchase cricketers who are not very famous, unknown or uncapped i.e. not played for their nation, at cut-throat prices. The Royals are famous for their frugal spending in the IPL auctions, even during the mega-auctions held once in 3 years. They have even bought players who had previously never played first-class cricket such as Dinesh Salunkhe and Pravin Tambe. The team has also purchased leading cricketers at various times in their history like Shane Warne, Graeme Smith, Rahul Dravid, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Munaf Patel, Mohammad Kaif, Shaun Tait, Ross Taylor, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn and Brad Hogg to name a few.\\r\\nMany of the cricketers who have played for the Royals, having been bought by them as relatively unknown players, have ended up as leading international cricketers partly due to their strong performances in the IPL and backing from the Royals management. In the initial seasons, such players included Taruwar Kohli, who was acquired by the franchise in 2008 under the Under-19 player quota and Yusuf Pathan, the elder brother of the Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan and a relative unknown in cricketing circles unlike his more-celebrated younger brother. Yusuf's brilliant performances in the initial seasons of the IPL earned him a place in the Indian cricket team, and was a member of the Indian squad which won the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Even Australian Shane Watson, who has played for the Royals ever since its inception, became a permanent, consistent and leading member of the Australian cricket team soon after his brilliant first season with the Royals in 2008. In the later seasons, these players have included Indian cricketers such as Ajinkya Rahane, wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson, leg-spinner Tambe, whose performances for the Royals earned him a Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai at the age of 42,[60] Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni, as well as international cricketers like James Faulkner, Steve Smith and Tim Southee. Even off-spinner Ajit Chandila, who played only 2 first-class matches and was also convicted in the spot-fixing scandal, was one of the top bowlers for the Royals during the 2012 and 2013 seasons.[61]\\r\\nThe home venue of the Royals is the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. The stadium was built during the reign of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II, who was also known as SMS, hence the name stadium. It is situated at one corner of the Rambagh Circle. The stadium seats 30,000 and is one of the best in India, after the 2006 renovation.\\r\\nBut in 2014, Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad hosted the Rajasthan Royals home matches.[62]\\r\\nSawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, is set to host Royals home games in 2018 IPL season after Rajasthan Royals were suspended for 2 years in 2015 and after Stadium is banned to host matches for 4 years.\\r\\n[63]\\r\\nCaptain: Shane Warne\\r\\nThe Royals won the inaugural DLF IPL T-20 Tournament on 1 June 2008.

It is subdivided into 100 cents. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is the governmental currency board and also the de facto central bank for Hong Kong and the Hong Kong dollar.\\r\\nUnder the licence from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, three commercial banks are licensed to issue their own banknotes for general circulation in Hong Kong. The three commercial banks, HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered issue their own designs of banknotes in denominations of HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000, with all designs being similar to the other in the same denomination of banknote. However, the HK$10 banknote and all coins are issued by the Government of Hong Kong.\\r\\nAs of April 2016, the Hong Kong dollar is the thirteenth most traded currency in the world.[3] Apart from its use in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong dollar is also used in neighbouring Macau, where the Hong Kong dollar circulates alongside the Macau pataca.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Hong Kong was established as a free trading port in 1841,[5] there was no local currency in everyday circulation. Foreign currencies such as Indian rupees, Spanish and Mexican 8 reales, and Chinese cash coins circulated. Since 1825, it had been the policy of the British government to introduce sterling silver coinage to all of its colonies, and to this end, in 1845 the Spanish and Mexican 8 reales coins were set at a legal tender value of 4 shillings, 2 pence sterling (S?5?24).[5] But just as in the case of the British North American colonies, the attempts to introduce the sterling coinage failed to overcome the strong local adherence to the silver Spanish dollar system.\\r\\nBy 1858, the British government gave up all attempts to influence the currency situation in Canada, and by the 1860s it came to the same realisation in Hong Kong: that there was no point in trying to displace an already existing currency system. In 1863, the Royal Mint in London began issuing special subsidiary coinage for use in Hong Kong within the dollar system. In 1866, a local mint was established at Sugar Street in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island for the purpose of minting Hong Kong silver dollar and half dollar coins of the same value and similar likeness to their Mexican counterparts.[5] The Chinese did not however receive these new Hong Kong dollars well, and in 1868 the Hong Kong Mint was closed down with a loss of $440,000. The machinery at the Hong Kong mint was sold first to Jardine Matheson and in turn to the Japanese and used to make the first Yen coins in 1870. In the 1860s, banknotes of the new British colonial banks, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, denominated in dollars, also began to circulate in both Hong Kong and the wider region.\\r\\nIn 1873, the international silver crisis resulted in a devaluation of silver against gold-based currencies. Since the silver dollars in the USA and Canada were attached to a gold exchange standard, this meant that the silver dollars circulating along the China coast dropped in value as compared to the US dollar and the Canadian dollar.\\r\\nBy 1895, the circumstances had changed to the extent that there was now a dearth of Mexican dollars and the authorities in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements were putting pressure on the authorities in London to take measures to have a regular supply of silver dollar coins. London eventually acquiesced and legislation was enacted in attempts to regulate the coinage. New British trade dollars were coined at the mints in Calcutta and Bombay for use in both Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements. In 1906, the Straits Settlements issued their own silver dollar coin and attached it to a gold sterling exchange standard at a fixed value of 2 shillings and 4 pence. This was the point of departure as between the Hong Kong unit and the Straits unit.\\r\\nBy 1935, only Hong Kong and China remained on the silver standard. In that year, Hong Kong, shortly after China, abandoned silver and introduced a crawling peg to sterling of S1 = HK$15.36 to HK$16.45. It was from this point in time that the concept of a Hong Kong dollar as a distinct unit of currency came into existence. The One-Dollar Currency Note Ordinance of that year led to the introduction of one-dollar notes by the government and the government acknowledged the Hong Kong dollar as the local monetary unit. It was not until 1937 that the legal tender of Hong Kong was finally unified. In 1939, the Hong Kong dollar was put on a fixed peg of HK$16 = S1 ($1 = 1s 3d).\\r\\nDuring the Japanese occupation, the Japanese military yen were the only means of everyday exchange in Hong Kong. When the yen was first introduced on 26 December 1941, the exchange rate was 1 yen = HK$2. However, in August 1942, the rate was changed to HK$4 to 1 yen. The yen became the only legal tender on 1 June 1943. The issue of local currency was resumed by the Hong Kong government and the authorised local banks after liberation, with the pre-war rate of HK$16 = S1 being restored. The yen was exchanged at a rate of 100 = HK$1. On 6 September 1945, all military yen notes used in Japanese colonies were declared void by the Japanese Ministry of Finance.\\r\\nIn 1967, when sterling was devalued, the dollar's peg to the pound was increased from 1s 3d to 1s ?4?1?2d ($14.5455 = S1) although this did not entirely offset the devaluation. In 1972, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of HK$5.65 = US$1. This was revised to HK$5.085 = US$1 in 1973. Between 1974 and 1983, the Hong Kong dollar floated. On 17 October 1983, the currency was pegged at a rate of HK$7.8 = US$1, through the currency board system.\\r\\nAs of 18 May 2005, in addition to the lower guaranteed limit, a new upper guaranteed limit was set for the Hong Kong dollar at HK$7.75 to the US dollar. The lower limit has been lowered from 7.80 to 7.85 (by 100 pips per week from 23 May to 20 June 2005).[6] The Hong Kong Monetary Authority indicated this move is to narrow the gap between the interest rates in Hong Kong and those of the United States. A further aim of allowing the Hong Kong dollar to trade in a range is to avoid the HK dollar being used as a proxy for speculative bets on a renminbi revaluation.\\r\\nThe Basic Law of Hong Kong and the Sino-British Joint Declaration provides that Hong Kong retains full autonomy with respect to currency issuance. Currency in Hong Kong is issued by the government and three local banks (HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered) under the supervision of the territory's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Banknotes are printed by Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\\r\\nA bank can issue a Hong Kong dollar only if it has the equivalent exchange in US dollars on deposit. The currency board system ensures that Hong Kong's entire monetary base is backed with US dollars at the linked exchange rate. The resources for the backing are kept in Hong Kong's exchange fund, which is among the largest official reserves in the world. Hong Kong also has huge deposits of US dollars, with official foreign currency reserves of US$361 billion as of March 2016.[7]\\r\\nIn formal Cantonese, the ?A or  (Cantonese Yale: yn) character is used. In spoken Cantonese, q (Cantonese Yale: mn) is used. The use of the character q (mn) originate from the tone change of the currency denomination used in China in imperial times \` (Cantonese Yale: mn), which was the chief denomination until the introduction of the yuan in the late 19th century.\\r\\nThe dollar is divided into 100 cents, with the character  (Cantonese Yale: sؐn, a transliteration of cent) used on coins and in spoken Cantonese. However,  is now only used in the stock market, as now it no longer has a note or coin form due to its small value, and is no longer used in regular cash transactions. The amount of 10 cents is called 1 hou () in Cantonese .\\r\\nTo express prices in spoken Cantonese, for example HK$7.80, the phrase is ?? (Cantonese Yale: cht go baat; literally: \\"seven units eight\\"); in financial terms, where integer values in cents exist, e.g., HK$6.75, the phrase is ?? (Cantonese Yale: luhk go cht hu bun; literally: \\"six units and seven dime half\\"; fives in cents is normally expressed as half, unless followed by another five, such as 55 cents when preceded by a dollar value); $7.08 is ېq^ (Cantonese Yale: cht mn lng baat sؐn; literally: \\"seven dollars zero eight cents\\").\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, the following are slang terms used to refer to various amounts of money:\\r\\nSome of these terms are also used by overseas Chinese to refer their local currency. A slang term in English sometimes used for the Hong Kong dollar is \\"Honkie\\".[8]\\r\\nIn 1863, 1-mil (?1?10-cent), 1-cent and 10-cent coins were introduced, followed in 1866 by 5- and 20- cents, half-dollar and 1-dollar. The 1-mil and 1-cent were struck in bronze, with the 1 mil a holed coin. The remaining coins were struck in silver. Production of the 1-mil ended in 1866, whilst that of the half-dollar and 1-dollar ceased in 1868, with only the half-dollar (now with the denomination given as 50 cents) resuming production in 1890. Production of all silver coins was suspended in 1905, only briefly resumed in 1932 and 1933 for the production of 5-cent coins.\\r\\nIn 1934, the last 1-cent coins were issued, but the last minting was 1941. These were not issued because the Japanese sank a ship carrying 1-cent coins bound for Hong Kong in the Second World War. The following year (1935), cupro-nickel 5 and 10 cents were introduced, replaced by nickel in 1937 and nickel-brass between 1948 and 1949. Copper-nickel 50 cents were issued in 1951 and first bore the name \\"fifty cents\\" in both Chinese and English, but these were changed to nickel-brass in 1977.\\r\\nIn 1960, cupro-nickel 1-dollar coins were introduced, these were then reduced in size in 1978. They were followed in 1975 by nickel-brass 20 cents and cupro-nickel 2-dollar (both scallop shaped), and in 1976 by decagonal, cupro-nickel 5-dollar coin, changed to a round thicker shape in 1980. The 5-cent coin was last issued in 1979, but last struck in 1988. In 1994, a bimetallic 10-dollar coin was introduced.\\r\\nStarting in 1993, prior to the establishment of the HKSAR, coins with Queen Elizabeth II's portrait were gradually withdrawn from circulation. Most of the notes and coins in circulations feature Hong Kong's Bauhinia flower or other symbols. Coins with the Queen's portrait are still legal tender and can be seen, but these are slowly being phased out. However, most still remain in legal tender and are in circulation. Because the redesign was highly sensitive with regard to political and economic reasons, the designing process of the new coins could not be entrusted to an artist but was undertaken by Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, himself who found in the bauhinia the requested \\"politically neutral design\\" and did a secret \\"scissors and paste job\\".[9]\\r\\nIn 1997, to commemorate Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty from Britain to the PRC, the government issued a new commemorative coin set which depicted Chinese cultural themes and Hong Kong's landmarks and 19 and 97, marking the year 1997, on each side of the designs.\\r\\nAs of today, coins in denominations of HK$10, HK$5, HK$2, HK$1, 50 cents, 20 cents and 10 cents are issued by Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government of Hong Kong.\\r\\nThe issue of Hong Kong dollar notes is governed today by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the governmental currency board of Hong Kong. Under licence from the HKMA, three commercial banks issue their own banknotes for general circulation in the region. They are Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited; the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited; and the Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited. Notes are also issued by the HKMA itself. In most countries of the world the issue of banknotes is handled exclusively by a single central bank or government. The arrangements in Hong Kong are unusual but not unique; a comparable system is used in the United Kingdom, where seven banks issue banknotes.\\r\\nAs of today, the three commercial banks, HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered issue their own designs of banknotes in denominations of HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000, with all designs being similar to the other in the same denomination of banknote. While only the HK$10 banknote is issued solely by Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government of Hong Kong, which in total makes up the banknote circulation arrangement to four different note issuers.\\r\\nIn 1845, the first private bank, the Oriental Bank, was founded. However, banknotes were not produced until the 1860s, when the Oriental Bank, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Company began issuing notes. Denominations issued in the 1860s and 1870s included 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 dollars. These notes were not accepted by the Treasury for payment of government dues and taxes, although they were accepted for use by merchants. 25 dollar notes did not survive beyond the end of the 19th century, whilst the 1-dollar notes (only produced by the HSBC) were issued until 1935.\\r\\nUnder the Currency Ordinance of 1935, banknotes in denominations of 5 dollars and above issued by the three authorised local banks, the Mercantile Bank of India Limited, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, were all declared legal tender. The government took over production of 1 dollar notes. In 1941, the government introduced notes for 1, 5 and 10 cents due to the difficulty of transporting coins to Hong Kong caused by the Second World War (a ship carrying 1941 1-cent coins was sunk, making this unissued coin very rare). Just before the Japanese occupation, an emergency issue of 1 dollar notes was made consisting of overprinted Bank of China 5 yuan notes.\\r\\nIn 1945, paper money production resumed essentially unaltered from before the war, with the government issuing 1, 5 and 10 cents, and 1-dollar notes, and the three banks issuing 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500-dollar notes. 1-dollar notes were replaced by coins in 1960, with only the 1-cent note issued by the government after 1965.\\r\\nIn 1975, the 5-dollar notes were replaced by a coin, whilst 1,000-dollar notes were introduced in 1977. The Mercantile Bank was absorbed by the HSBC in 1978 and ceased issuing notes. In 1985, 20-dollar notes were introduced, whilst, in 1993, a 10-dollar coin was introduced and the banks stopped issuing 10 dollar notes. In 1994 the HKMA gave authority to the Bank of China to issue notes.\\r\\nAfter a less-than-successful trial from 1994 to 2002 to move the 10-dollar denomination from the banknote format (issued by the banks) to the coin format (Government-issued), 10 dollar banknotes are currently the only denomination issued by the HKMA, having acquired the note printing plant at Tai Po from the De La Rue Group of the UK on behalf of the Government. The older 10-dollar banknotes are, although rare and being phased out, still circulating.\\r\\nA commemorative polymer ten dollar note was issued in July 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China.[10] The new notes will circulate along with other issues for a trial period of two years, though the initial batch released was largely snapped up by collectors.[11][12]\\r\\nA new series of banknotes was issued starting in 2010.[13] In 2015, HSBC issued 150-dollar notes in celebration for its 150th anniversary.\\r\\nSince 1983, the linked exchange rate system is a unique type of exchange rate regime used for the Hong Kong dollar to be pegged with the United States dollar at a fixed rate of HK$7.80 = US$1. In this unique linked exchange rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) authorises the three note-issuing banks (HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered) to issue new banknotes provided that they deposit an equivalent value of United States dollars with the HKMA.\\r\\nIn practice, in the unique linked exchange rate system, the exchange rate of HK$7.80 = US$1, is strictly controlled by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in the foreign exchange market by controlling supply and demand of Hong Kong dollars in order to influence the exchange rate being fixed. By this arrangement the HKMA guarantees to exchange United States dollar into Hong Kong dollars and vice versa, at the rate of 7.80. When the market rate is below 7.80, the banks will convert United States dollar for Hong Kong dollars from the HKMA, Hong Kong dollars supply will increase, and the market rate will climb back to 7.80. The same mechanism also works when the market rate is above 7.80, and the banks will convert Hong Kong dollars for United States dollars.\\r\\nBy this arrangement, the Hong Kong dollar is backed by one of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, which is over 7 times the amount of money supplied in circulation or about 48% of Hong Kong dollar M3 at the end of April 2016.[14]\\r\\nFollowing the Internationalization of the renminbi and the inclusion of the Renminbi in the Special drawing rights, there has been debates to peg the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi, instead of the United States dollar. Studies shows that, if the Hong Kong dollar were to be re-pegged to the Renminbi, it would need over 2 trillion Renminbi worth of assets to replace the HKMAs US$340 billion in foreign reserves as of 2015, which exceeds the amount of existing Renminbi assets in Hong Kongs offshore market. Moreover, according to figures from the HKMA as of the end of 2014, Renminbi deposits and certificates of deposits stood at 1.158 trillion Renminbi, while outstanding Renminbi bonds amounted to 381 billion and Renminbi-denominated loans stood at 188 billion.[15] Other studies shows, while the Hong Kong's financial and economic links are increasingly dominated by mainland China, and previous concerns about the openness of China's capital account are slowly receding, if China continues to open its capital account, the peg could shift from United States dollar to renminbi.[16]\\r\\nHowever, in January 2016, the volatility in the Renminbi and China's financial markets expanded to Hong Kongs markets and its currency. Renminbi offshore overnight borrowing rate, HIBOR, soared to 66.8% on January 12 after People's Bank of China - Chinas central bank (PBOC) intervened in the effort of squeezing out Renminbi short speculations by tightening liquidity at Hong Kong commercial banks. The PBOCs move at the offshore market, coupled with another plunge in Chinese stocks, has led to investors fears that the Hong Kong Dollar may be de-pegged from the US Dollar in the foreseeable future. In response to the market speculation, Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on January 27 that the regulator will protect Hong Kong dollar's linked exchange rate regime. Yet, many investors no longer consider Hong Kong as a safe haven as they once had given increasing financial influence by mainland China. As Hong Kongs financial markets are highly impacted by mainland China, the Renminbi exchange rate as well as Chinas equity market remain is in a state of high volatility and continues to weigh on Hong Kong markets and the Hong Kong dollar.[17]\\r\\n(for issue and redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness)\\r\\n(The HKMA undertakes to convert the HK dollars in licensed banks clearing accounts maintained with the HKMA into US dollars at the fixed exchange rate of HK$7.75 to US$1.

USS Iwo Jima was christened by her sponsor, Mrs. Zandra Krulak, wife of General Charles C. Krulak, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps, in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 25 March 2000. The commissioning crew moved aboard in April 2001, and made the ship's maiden voyage on 23 June 2001, accompanied by more than 2,000 World War II veterans  many of them survivors of the Battle of Iwo Jima. She was commissioned a week later in Pensacola, Florida, on 30 June 2001.\\r\\nShortly thereafter, the ship and crew began an accelerated Inter Deployment Training Cycle, which tested virtually every system on board in realistic combat conditions.

Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton","context":"The National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) was formed on May 15, 1869 in New York City.[1] The National Association was created in response to a split in the American Equal Rights Association[2] over whether the woman's movement should support the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[3] Its founders, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, opposed the Fifteenth Amendment unless it included the vote for women.[4] Men were able to join the organization as members; however, women solely controlled the leadership of the group.[5] The NWSA worked to secure women's enfranchisement through a federal constitutional amendment.[3] Contrarily, its rival, the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), believed success could be more easily achieved through state-by-state campaigns.[2] In 1890 the NWSA and the AWSA merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the harbingers of dissent within different factions of the woman suffrage movement may be seen in the National Woman's Rights Convention of 1860 (the last national convention before the outbreak of the war), woman's rights activism largely ceased during the Civil War. The movement re-emerged to the national scene in 1866 to organize formally under a new name ÿ the American Equal Rights Association (AERA) ÿ and defined by a new platform.[7] Confronted by the proposal of the reconstruction amendments, which introduced the word \\"male\\" to the United States Constitution, the AERA eventually dissolved over whether suffrage for emancipated slaves and women would be pursued simultaneously.[7] The schism was cemented by the decision of Republican lawmakers and their former abolitionist allies that this was \\"the Negro's hour,\\" leaving woman suffrage to be deferred to a more opportune moment.\\r\\nFollowing the May 1869 American Equal Rights Association convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, Jacqueline Valenzuela, and Bianet Cuevas Parra established the National Woman Suffrage Association (hereafter referred to as \\"the National\\").[4] Feeling misguided and deceived, Stanton and Anthony resorted to such bold action largely due to their belief that the preponderance of men composing the AERA leadership had betrayed women's interest.[2] In addition to a feeling of betrayal, deep differences between the factions of the movement centered on numerous issues, including how AERA funds were to be used, and, most importantly, whether the reconstruction amendments should be supported despite their failure to include women.[8]\\r\\nMeeting at the Women's Bureau in New York City, Stanton, Anthony and delegates from nineteen states of the AERA convention, appointed Elizabeth Cady Stanton as the National's President.[5] Other prominent activists forming the National were Lucretia Mott, Martha Coffin Wright, Ernestine Rose (part of the Executive Committee), Pauline Wright Davis (Advisory Counsel of Rhode Island), Reverend Olympia Brown, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Anna E. Dickinson (Vice-President of Pennsylvania), Elizabeth Smith Miller and Mary Cheney Greeley among others.[9] The women immediately turned their efforts toward passage of a Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote.\\r\\nIn response, Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell, Julia Ward Howe and Wendell Phillips among others established the American Woman Suffrage Association in September of that year in Boston. The death knell had rung upon the American Equal Rights Association.[7]\\r\\nUnlike the American Association who held their conventions in various cities across the country, the National Association held its annual conventions in Washington D.C. with its efforts concentrated on the federal government.[6] Although focused on national reform, the National established its headquarters in New York City, seeking to mobilize support among wage-earning women. The National Association was centralized and unitary in structure, as opposed to the more stringent delegate system of the American Association. Feeling slighted by the apostasy of men under the American Equal Rights Association, the National Association granted full membership rights for women only.[4] Men could affiliate with the organization, however, women solely controlled its leadership.[5] By the same token, Stanton and Anthony were willing to work with anyone, despite their view on other matters, as long as they wholeheartedly championed woman rights and suffrage. As a result, the National Association was often perceived as radical, unorthodox and aggressive.[2] Such drastic measures included using racist appeals to win allies among Democrats.[4] The National, however, often condemned both those Republicans and Democrats who ignored the suffrage question.[2]\\r\\nIn 1883, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the officers of the National adopted a new Constitution of the National Woman Suffrage Association.[10] It consisted of the five following articles:[9]\\r\\nAs stated in the fifth article, state, district and town woman's suffrage associations were welcomed to become auxiliaries. According to the \\"Plan For Organization,\\" to organize as a group, a convention of the region must be called by the Vice-President of the state and the Advisory Counsel of each state where the officers would be chosen in coordination with the National's rules.[11]\\r\\nIn founding the National Association, Stanton and Anthony regarded woman's rights as a broad cause, in which the franchise was of primary importance. The organization, however, advocated a broad platform in supporting the individual liberties of women.[11] As Eleanor Flexner explains, \\"It [the National] was willing to take up the cudgels for distressed women whatever their circumstances, be they 'fallen women,' divorce cases, or underpaid seamstresses.\\"[11] The broad focus espoused by the National Association allowed it to address a diverse array of social, economical and political issues.\\r\\nIn advocating for a federal amendment to assure women the ballot, the National relied on a natural rights argument. The National adopted the constitutional argument put forth by Francis and Virginia Minor at the Missouri Woman Suffrage Convention in St. Louis in October 1869. Using a constitutional interpretation that used language and directly derived from the Fourteenth Amendment, the Minors argued that women had the right to suffrage because they were citizens. Other general arguments Stanton and the National exercised included points that women were taxed without representation, governed without their consent, and tried and punished without a jury of their peers.[7]\\r\\nThe National brought the constitutionality of denying the franchise to the national limelight by printing Minor's resolutions in its periodical, The Revolution. At the time of the National Association's Washington Convention of 1870, ten thousand copies of Minor's resolutions were circulating around the audience, with copies placed on every member's desk in Congress.[7] In adopting such ideology, officers of the National Association soon began to later their speeches, resolutions and hearing before Congress. They also made diverse attempts to vote in various states across the country.[7]\\r\\nDuring its short life, The Revolution, the weekly newsletter of the National Association, frequently urged reforms to benefit workingwomen.[5] Supported by financier George Train, editor David Melliss and managed by Anthony, The Revolution paraded the motto: \\"Men, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less!\\"[2]\\r\\nThe weekly sixteen-page paper reported news not found elsewhere, such as the organization of women typesetters, of the first women's clubs, and of women abroad.[2] The Revolution for a short time gave the National a forum, focus and direction. The newsletter, moreover, reflected the broad agenda of the organization. As Eleanor Flexner elaborates, for instance, The Revolution \\"exhorted women to equip themselves to earn their own livelihood, to practice bodily hygiene in the matter of fresh air, dress, and exercise.\\"[2] On January 8, 1870 ÿ the anniversary of the founding of The Revolution ÿ the American Association launched its periodical, The Woman's Journal.[2] Faced with rising debts, and the rising popularity of The Woman's Journal, The Revolution succumbed in May 1870.[2]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1876, the nation celebrated its Centennial with a highly anticipated exposition in Philadelphia, the first of its kind in America. Opening headquarters in Philadelphia, the National Association sought to use the occasion to draw attention to the inequitable position of women, as well as to organize women from all over the country to exchange their knowledge and experiences.[2] When Richard Henry Lee of Virginia, the presiding officer of the July 4th exposition, finished reading the Declaration of Independence, the ladies walked down the aisle and approached the stage where Anthony made a brief speech.[5] Members of the National then presented the presiding officer with a Women's Declaration of Rights.[12] The Women's Declaration of Rights listed the natural rights protected by the government as part of the social contract and went forth to state that the government was infringing upon those rights. In response, the authors listed nine rights for women labeled \\"Articles of Impeachment.\\" These articles referenced the ways in which women were oppressed and wronged and asked the government to give women the civil and political rights guaranteed to them.[13]\\r\\nOne year later at the National's Convention of January 1877, the organization continued to carry out bold reform measures. Keeping pressure on Congress, the National drafted a federal amendment calling for woman suffrage ÿ penned by Elizabeth Cady Stanton ÿ that was reintroduced to the Legislature annually until its eventual adoption in 1919.[5] In the same year, furthermore, Anthony led a group of women onto the floor of the United States Senate bearing suffrage petitions with ten thousand signatures.[14] Such efforts signify the extensive efforts of the National Woman Suffrage Association to keep pressure on the federal government to promote the causes concerning women's rights, while bringing the injustice the encountered to national prominence.\\r\\nIn 1890 the National Association and the American Association merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).[6] The merger negotiations between the two organizations began in 1887, dragged for three years, and were finally consummated at a joint convention in February 1890 where the NAWSA nominated Elizabeth Cady Stanton as its first President.[2]","input":"Who founded the national woman's suffrage association?"},{"output":"RuPaul Andre Charles","context":"RuPaul Andre Charles (born November 17, 1960), known professionally by the mononym RuPaul, is an American actor, drag queen, television personality, and singer/songwriter.

The \\"Ru\\" came from roux, which is the term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups.[3] When his parents divorced in 1967, he and his three sisters lived with their mother, Ernestine \\"Toni\\" Charles.[4]\\r\\nAt the age of 15, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, with his sister Renetta to study performing arts. In the ensuing years, RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker during the 1980s. He participated in underground cinema, helping create the low-budget film Star Booty, and an album by the same name. In Atlanta, RuPaul often performed at the Celebrity Club (managed by Larry Tee) as a bar dancer or with his band, Wee Wee Pole.[5][6] RuPaul also performed as a backup singer to Glen Meadmore along with drag queen Vaginal Davis.[7] RuPaul's first prominent United States national exposure came in 1989 with an extra role dancing in the video for \\"Love Shack\\" by The B-52's.\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in gender bender-style performances, RuPaul performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several New York City nightclubs, most notably the Pyramid Club. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foote (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act science-fiction parody \\"My Pet Homo\\" written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He appeared for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie. In the 1990s, RuPaul was known in the UK for his appearances on the Channel 4 series Manhattan Cable, a weekly series produced by World of Wonder and presented by American Laurie Pike about New York's wild and wacky public-access television system.\\r\\nIn 1993 RuPaul recorded the dance/house album Supermodel of the World. It was released through the rap label Tommy Boy, spawning the dance track hit \\"Supermodel (You Better Work)\\". The music video was an unexpected success on MTV channels, as grunge and gangsta rap were popular at the time. The song peaked at #45 on the Billboard Hot 100. It further charted on the UK Singles Chart, peaking on the top 40 at #39. The song found the most success on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it peaked at #2. Radio airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on MTV and television appearances on popular programs like The Arsenio Hall Show popularized the song.\\r\\nHis next two singles/videos, \\"Back to My Roots\\" and \\"A Shade Shady (Now Prance)\\" both went #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and furthered his campy persona. Between them, \\"House of Love\\" was released without a video. It failed to place on any U.S. charts, despite rising to #68 on the UK Singles Chart.\\r\\nRuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for MAC Cosmetics, making him the first drag queen supermodel. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text \\"I am the MAC girl\\". He also released his autobiography, Lettin' It All Hang Out. He promoted that book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on ABC's All My Children, in a storyline that put it on the set of Erica Kane's talk show \\"The Cutting Edge\\".\\r\\nThe next year he landed a talk show of his own on VH1, called The RuPaul Show, interviewing celebrity guests and musical acts. Diana Ross, Nirvana, Duran Duran, Pat Benatar, Mary J. Blige, Bea Arthur, Dionne Warwick, Cyndi Lauper, Olivia Newton-John, Beenie Man, Pete Burns, Bow Wow Wow, and the Backstreet Boys were notable guests. His co-host was Michelle Visage, with whom he also co-hosted on WKTU radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests Chi Chi LaRue and Tom Chase speaking about the gay porn industry.\\r\\nLater in the year he released his second album, Foxy Lady, this time on the L.A.-based Rhino Records label. Despite his growing celebrity, he failed to chart within the Billboard 200. However, the first single \\"Snapshot\\" found success in the dance market and went to number four on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at number 95 on the Billboard Hot 100 (which was his second and only other Hot 100 entry to date). The second single \\"A Little Bit of Love\\" only charted at number 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album featured covers of a 1981 Diana Ross song \\"Work That Body\\", co-written by Paul Jabara and \\"If You Were a Woman and I Was a Man\\", originally recorded by Bonnie Tyler. Because of his strong fan base within the gay community, RuPaul has performed at gay pride events and numerous gay clubs. During this time RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in New York City and would serve as host of the morning show until 1998.\\r\\nIn 1997 he released his third album, a Christmas album entitled Ho Ho Ho. He has had guest appearances in many films, including both Brady Bunch movies, in which he played Jan's female guidance counselor. In 1997 RuPaul teamed with Martha Wash to remake the classic disco anthem, \\"It's Raining Men\\". The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD RuPaul's Go Go Box Classics, which was a collection of some of his favorite dance songs by other artists; this would be his third and final release through Rhino Records and a major record label. It was during this time that he appeared in Webex TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002 he recorded with Brigitte Nielsen, credited as Gitta, the Eurodance track \\"You're No Lady\\".\\r\\nIn 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, Red Hot on his own RuCo Inc. Music label. It received some dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his blog, RuPaul discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the gay press. In one incident, it was noted that the magazine Entertainment Weekly refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to \\"a black person being invited to a party, but only if they'll serve.\\" Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, Red Hot showed RuPaul returning to the top of the dance charts in the US with the lead off single \\"Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous\\" hitting number two on the dance chart. The second, \\"WorkOut\\", peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album \\"People Are People\\" a duet with Tom Trujillo peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the Top Electronic Albums chart, where it hit number nine.[9] When asked about this in an interview, RuPaul said, \\"Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. 'Betrayed' alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals.\\"[8]\\r\\nOn June 13, 2006, RuPaul released ReWorked, his first remix album and fifth album overall. It features reworked versions of songs from his back catalog, as well as new recordings. The only single released from the album is a re-recording of \\"Supermodel (You Better Work)\\", reaching number 21 on the U.S. dance chart. June 20, 2007, saw the release of Starrbooty (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) in the United States. The single \\"Call Me Starrbooty\\" was digitally released in 2007. The album contains new tracks from the singer as well as interludes with dialogue from the movie. The film was released on DVD in October 2007.\\r\\nIn mid-2008, RuPaul began producing RuPaul's Drag Race, a reality television game show which aired on Logo in February 2009. The premise of the program has several drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as \\"America's next drag superstar\\". The first season's winner was BeBe Zahara Benet, and first runner-up Nina Flowers was chosen by fans as \\"Miss Congeniality\\" through voting via the show's official website. In publicity preparation for the new show, RuPaul made appearances as a guest on several other shows in 2008 including as a guest judge on episode 6 of season 5 of Project Runway[10] and as a guest \\"chef\\" on Paula's Party.[11]\\r\\nIn March 2009, RuPaul released the album Champion. The album peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums as well as number 26 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. It features the dance singles \\"Cover Girl\\" and \\"Jealous of My Boogie\\", both anthems from the reality show RuPaul's Drag Race. Logo's second annual NewNowNext Awards in 2009 were hosted by RuPaul. There he performed \\"Jealous of My Boogie (Gomi & RasJek Edit)\\". In March 2010, RuPaul released his second remix album, Drag Race. The album features remixes of songs from the 2009 album Champion.\\r\\nIn April 2011, coinciding with the finale of season 3 of RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul released his sixth studio album Glamazon, produced by Revolucian, who previously worked with RuPaul on his album Champion. The album charted on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart at #11 and #8 respectively. In July 2011, RuPaul released another remix EP entitled SuperGlam DQ, which features remixes of tracks from Glamazon, remixes of the \\"Drag U Theme Song\\", and a new song, \\"Sexy Drag Queen\\". Starting in June 2011, the second season of RuPaul's Drag U aired. In late 2011, promotions for season 4 of Drag Race began. RuPaul made appearances on The Rosie Show and The Chew, and also attended a Drag Race NY Premiere party at Patricia Field's store in New York. Season 4 of RuPaul's Drag Race premiered on Logo on January 30, 2012, with RuPaul returning as the main host and judge. After season 4 ended, TV.com declared that it was the best reality TV show on television.\\r\\nIn the fall of 2012, the spin-off RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars premiered after a large fan demand. The show featured past contestants of the previous four seasons to compete. Season 5 of RuPaul's Drag Race premiered on January 28, 2013, with a 90-minute special and RuPaul returning as the main host and judge. On April 30, 2013, RuPaul released a single \\"Lick It Lollipop\\" featuring Lady Bunny, who RuPaul previously collaborated with on Champion. On October 25, 2013 RuPaul reported via Twitter that the new album would be released in January 2014.\\r\\nIn fall of 2013, RuPaul joined forces with cosmetic manufacturers Colorevolution to launch his debut make-up line featuring ultra-rich pigment cosmetics and a beauty collection. Released alongside the line was a unisex perfume entitled \\"Glamazon\\". Talking to World of Wonder, RuPaul said: \\"Glamazon is for women and men of all ages and preferences who share one thing in common: They are not afraid to be fierce. For me, glamour should be accessible to all, and I am committed to helping the world look and smell more beautiful.\\" The line was exclusively sold on the Colorevolution website in various gift sets.[12][13]\\r\\nRuPaul and Revolucian both confirmed through their Twitter and Instagram accounts that they had been working on an upcoming seventh studio album. Born Naked was released on February 24, 2014 to coincide with the premiere of the 6th season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Prior to the premiere, an album of RuPaul cover songs performed by the Season 6 cast was released on January 28, 2014. The covers album is titled RuPaul Presents The CoverGurlz and contains RuPaul songs from 2009ÿ2013. To further promote the Drag Race season premiere, RuPaul, representing Logo TV (and parent company Viacom) was chosen to ring the NASDAQ closing bell on February 24, 2014. The week of its release, Born Naked reached number one on the iTunes dance album chart. The following week it placed at number 4 on the US Billboard dance chart and number 85 on the Billboard 200 chart. In a profile by The New York Times it was revealed that RuPaul is currently working on a porcelain statuette of his likeness.[14] On April 9, 2014 RuPaul and Michelle Visage released the first episode of their podcast, RuPaul: What's the Tee? with Michelle Visage. In August, he joined the reality competition show Skin Wars acting as a judge.\\r\\nOn March 2, 2015, RuPaul released his eighth studio album entitled Realness. The release coincided with the premiere of the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race. In April, he launched and began hosting a new show, Good Work, a plastic surgery-themed talk show for E!. In October he released his second Christmas album (and ninth studio album) Slay Belles. The album contains 10 original Christmas-themed songs and features collaborations with Michelle Visage, Siedah Garrett, Todrick Hall and Big Freedia. The album charted at number 21 on the US Billboard Dance chart.[15]\\r\\nIn January 2016, it was announced RuPaul would present a new game show for Logo TV called Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul which premiered on April 11, 2016 after RuPaul's Drag Race.[16] In February 2016, RuPaul announced his tenth album, Butch Queen. It was released on March 4, 2016, just prior to the premiere of the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.[17] A song from the album, \\"U Wear It Well\\" was featured in the teaser campaigns for the season and was later officially released as the first single on iTunes on February 29, 2016. The album charted at number 3 on the US Billboard Dance chart, marking his highest position on this chart to date.[15]\\"'Be Someone\\" featuring American singer Taylor Dayne was released as the album's second and final single. Additionally, Butch Queen: The Ru-Mixes was released.\\r\\nOn July 14, 2016 it was announced that RuPaul was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. He would go on to win the award at the September 11 Creative Arts Emmy Awards Ceremony. 2016 also saw the release of the dance single \\"Read U Wrote U\\" that features rap parts by the RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 2 finalists Roxxxy Andrews, Katya Zamolodchikova, Alaska Thunderfuck and Detox Icunt.\\r\\nOn January 27, 2017, RuPaul announced that a new album would be released the week after. The album, named Remember Me: Essential, Vol. 1 was put up for pre-order on February 2 and eventually released the next day. It is a collection of both, new songs and remakes of classic RuPaul hits that feature new artists.[18] Two singles have been released from the album so far: \\"Rock It (To The Moon)\\" which is a new song loosely based on the lyrics and the melody of \\"Hey Booty\\" which was released on the Starrbooty soundtrack in 2007 and an updated version of RuPaul's 1996 hit single \\"Snapshot\\" from the album Foxy Lady. The album failed to chart on the Dance Albums Chart but managed to debut at number four on the Billboard Dance Albums Sales Chart in the United States. It also charted at number eleven on the UK Dance Albums Chart, becoming RuPaul's highest charting album on that chart, after Realness managed to debut and peak at number 13.\\r\\nOn March 24, 2017, RuPaul released his eleventh studio album, American.[19] Later that same day, the ninth regular season of RuPaul's Drag Race debuted on basic cable channel VH1, home of RuPaul's talk show in the 1990s. This marked a move from expanded cable channel Logo TV, which aired all previous seasons of the show. The season 9 premiere featured singer Lady Gaga as its guest judge and proved a success, with ratings of nearly 1,000,000 viewers, making it the series' most viewed episode. This figure was double LogoTV's season 8 premiere ratings from the year prior, and triple VH1's usual Friday night viewership in that programming timeslot.[20] When the ratings were released, World of Wonder Productions announced they are casting contestants for a tenth season.[21]\\r\\nOn June 2, Essential, Vol. 2 was put up on pre-order on iTunes. It will be released on June 9 and is preceded by the single \\"Crying On The Dance Floor\\" which is a re-recording of the 2010 single \\"Main Event\\" from the Champion album.\\r\\nRuPaul is widely considered to be the most commercially successful drag queen of all time.[22] He has been accredited with creating wider exposure for drag queens from LGBT culture in to mainstream society, thanks to his early-career chart success, and later, the successive climb in viewership of RuPaul's Drag Race.[23] His talk show The RuPaul Show was the first ever national talk show to have a drag queen as a host. Along with his partner Michelle Visage, he welcomed an array of high-profile guests such as Cher, Lil Kim, and Diana Ross over the show's 100-episode span. As well as having a variety of comedy skits, the show was noted for discussing topics such as black empowerment, female empowerment, misogyny, and liberal politics which were otherwise unheard of in 90's television at the time.[24] In 1999, RuPaul was awarded the Vito Russo Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for work in promoting equality in the LGBT community.\\r\\nRuPaul has also been noted as having a large part in RuPaul's Drag Race's continuous television success. By pioneering queer representation on television, many believe RuPaul to have essentially revolutionised the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community on screen.[25] He first won an Emmy for his work on the show in 2016, and one year later the show garnered 8 nominations, including Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first time in it's 11-season run, and a second consecutive win for RuPaul in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. [26] In 2017, he was named by TIME Magazine as one of the most influential people in the world, where model Naomi Campbell cites \\"its incredible what hes done for the drag queens [...] bringing them out, introducing them to a mainstream audience and letting them be proud of who they are and what they want to be.\\" [27]\\r\\nRuPaul has been with his Australian partner, Georges LeBar, since 1994, when they met at the Limelight nightclub in New York City. They married in January 2017.[28] LeBar is a painter[29] and runs a 50,000-acre (200,000,000?m2) ranch in Wyoming.[30]\\r\\nRuPaul publicly endorsed the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.[31] He expressed dismay at Clinton's defeat by Republican Party nominee Donald Trump, stating that \\"The America that we have all fought so hard for, the narrative of love and peace and liberty and equality, it feels like it is dead.\\"[32] He has described doing drag as a \\"very, very political\\" act because it \\"challenges the status quo\\" by rejecting fixed identities: \\"drag says 'I'm a shapeshifter, I do whatever the hell I want at any given time'.\\"[33]\\r\\nThe podcast RuPaul: What's The Tee? With Michelle Visage debuted on April 6, 2014. Ru-Paul co-hosts with longtime friend and fellow 'RuPauls Drag Race' judge Michelle Visage. The weekly show features their thoughts on topics including behind-the-scenes of RuPaul's Drag Race, life advice, beauty tips, and conversations with featured guests from the entertainment world.[36][37]","input":"Who achieved international fame as a drag queen?"},{"output":"Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT20I kit\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kolkata Knight Riders (also known by the acronym KKR) are a franchise cricket team representing the city of Kolkata in the Indian Premier League. The franchise is owned by Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan, actress Juhi Chawla and her spouse Jay Mehta. The team is coached by Jacques Kallis. The home of the Knight Riders is Eden Gardens, the largest cricket stadium in India and the second largest in the world by seating capacity.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the team has gained immense popularity due to its association with celebrity owners, it was surrounded with controversy and poor on-field performance through the first three years of the tournament.[3] The team's performance, however, improved from the fourth season as it qualified for the IPL playoffs as well as the now defunct Champions League Twenty20. They eventually became the IPL champions for the first time in 2012, by defeating Chennai Super Kings in the final and repeated the feat in 2014, defeating Kings XI Punjab.[4] The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leading run-scorer of the side is Gautam Gambhir,[6] while the leading wicket-taker is Sunil Narine.[7] The official theme of the team is Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo Re (we will perform, fight and win!) and the official colours are purple and gold. The brand value of the Knight Riders was estimated at $99 million in 2017, second highest among IPL franchises.[3].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) created the cricket tournament Indian Premier League based on the Twenty20 form of the game.[8] Eight teams would participate in the inaugural tournament held in April ÿ June of the same year. The teams representing the eight different cities of India were put up on auction in Mumbai on 20 February. The team representing Kolkata was eventually bought by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's company Red Chillies Entertainment in partnership with actress Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta for a price of $75.09 million, equal to approximately ?2.98 billion at that time.[9] Sourav Ganguly, former captain of the Indian national team and a native of West Bengal, was named the Icon Player for the team. The name of the team is a reference to the popular 1980s American television series Knight Rider.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2015, they bought a stake in the Caribbean Premier League cricket team Trinidad and Tobago Red Steel[11] and later in 2016, renamed it Trinbago Knight Riders.[12] In July 2017, they bought Cape Town Knight Riders in the newly formed T20 Global League.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, when Kolkata Knight Riders were first introduced in 2008, the logo of the team consisted of a blazing golden Viking helmet against a black background with the name of the team written in gold next to it. However, the black background was changed to purple in the fourth season. It was in 2012 that the current logo, which has a blazing purple Corinthian helmet trimmed with gold, with Kolkata Knight Riders written within a shield was introduced.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tagline of the team was \\"All the King's Men\\" during the first four seasons.[15] However, in the fifth it was replaced by \\"New Dawn, New Knights\\". The team's official colours were black and gold during the first two seasons. At the time, Khan said that \\"golden symbolizes spirit of life and black presents the Goddess Kali.\\"[15] It was later changed to purple and gold during the third season and was kept so. The jersey was created by Bollywood fashion designer Manish Malhotra.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main theme of the team Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo Re (we will act, fight and win!) was scored by Vishal-Shekhar duo.[15] A Knight Riders album featuring several singers and music composers including Usha Uthup and Bappi Lahiri was also created.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home venue of the Knight Riders is the iconic Eden Gardens (with the two ends of the crease called the High Court End and the Club House End). Owned by the Cricket Association of Bengal, it is the largest cricket stadium in India and had a seating capacity of over 90,000.[18] In 2011, the stadium was renovated to meet the standards set by the ICC for the 2011 Cricket World Cup; reducing its capacity to around 68,000. The renovated stadium includes a new clubhouse and players' facilities, upgrading the exterior wall, cladding the existing roof structure with a new metal skin, and general infrastructure improvements.[19] In 2013, two of the team's home matches were hosted by the JSCA International Cricket Stadium in Ranchi.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultinational communications corporation Nokia was the official founding sponsor of the   Kolkata Knight Riders and remained their principal sponsor until 2014.[20][21][3] In 2015, Chinese mobile phone manufacturer Gionee took over as their principal sponsor and signed a three-year deal worth ?540 million (US$7.9?million).[22] In 2018, Nokia returned as the main sponsor of the Knight Riders, signing a two-year deal.[23] Star Plus, Reebok, HDIL, Kit Kat, Sprite, SB Nation, Doublemint, SAP AG, Red FM 93.5, Seiko, U.S. Polo Assn., Uber, Dish TV, Sansui, Ola Cabs, Pepsi and Sony Music India have all formerly been either their co-sponsors or partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2018, they have co-sponsorship deals with Jio, Lux Cozi, SRMB Steel, Exide, Royal Stag, JBL, The Telegraph, Fever 104 FM, Greenply and Kingfisher Premium along with several others.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSourav Ganguly, the former captain of the Indian cricket team was the icon player and led the franchise in the 2008 and 2010 seasons. Brendon McCullum lead the team in the intervening period. Both captains were released before the 2011 season. The former team included all-rounders Chris Gayle, David Hussey, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Angelo Mathews, batsman Ricky Ponting and wicket keeper Wriddhiman Saha. The main bowlers were Umar Gul, Ishant Sharma, Ashok Dinda, Ajit Agarkar and Murali Karthik. Australian batsman Brad Hodge and bowlers Ajantha Mendis and Charl Langeveldt were bought outside the IPL auction in late 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2009 auction the team bought Bangladeshi all-rounder Mashrafe Mortaza at a whopping price of $600,000 dollars. Due to the unavailability of Pakistani players starting 2009, KKR had to suspend the contract of Umar Gul, who was a key performer from the 2008 season.[25][26] On 26 April 2009, KKR administration sent back two of its players Akash Chopra and Sanjay Bangar on the premises of poor performance.[27] Shane Bond was acquired after releasing Ricky Ponting, Morne van Wyk and the Pakistani players Umar Gul, Salman Butt, Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Akhtar before the third season. Moises Henriques was traded to Delhi in return for Owais Shah and Manoj Tiwary. Thus, their overseas roster for the 2010 season consisted of Shane Bond, Mashrafe Mortaza, Brendon McCullum, Charl Langeveldt, Ajantha Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Brad Hodge, David Hussey, Owais Shah and Chris Gayle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2011 season, KKR drastically revamped their squad. Former captain and icon player Sourav Ganguly was not purchased in the January auction. This led to protest rallies, signature campaigns throughout the country and abroad along with stadium protests by various fan groups, such as No Dada No KKR,[28] which received both national and international press attention.[29][30][31] The team appointed Gautam Gambhir, who was bought for a record-breaking $2.4 million as skipper.[32] Yusuf Pathan was also picked up for a whopping $2.1 million.[32] Other international names who were added include Shakib Al Hasan, Brad Haddin, Jacques Kallis, Brett Lee, Ryan ten Doeschate, Eoin Morgan and James Pattinson. Haddin was replaced by Mark Boucher mid-season due to injury.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2012 auction, KKR bought back their former captain, Brendon McCullum. They also acquired West Indian spinner Sunil Narine and South African fast bowler Marchant de Lange.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team later added four domestic players to their squad, including Debabrata Das and Iresh Saxena from Bengal, Saurashtra's Chirag Jani and Sanju Samson from Kerala.[33] However, in November 2012, KKR released the latter three from their team along with Jaydev Unadkat, a key performer from the previous seasons. In the 2013 auction, the team acquired only two overseas players, Sachithra Senanayake and Ryan McLaren.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the February 2014 auction, the team had only retained their key performers Gautam Gambhir and Sunil Narine. From the auctions that took place, the team brought back Jacques Kallis and Yusuf Pathan with their right-to-match (RTM) card. Also keeping their place in the squad was Ryan ten Doeschate and Shakib Al Hasan. New international players were Morne Morkel, Patrick Cummins and Chris Lynn. Prominent Indian players bought included Robin Uthappa, Umesh Yadav, Manish Pandey, Suryakumar Yadav and Piyush Chawla.\\r\\n\\r\\nKKR's impressive additions in the 2015 auction were veteran Australian bowler Brad Hogg and wicket-keeper Sheldon Jackson. Before the auction in February 2016, they released Ryan ten Doeschate who was a part of their team for five consecutive seasons along with pace bowler Pat Cummins. The Knight Riders were particularly noted for their change in approach from the previous auctions where they had concentrated on spinners. For the 2016 edition, however, they acquired as many as six pacers in the form of all-rounders John Hastings, Colin Munro, Jason Holder and Rajagopal Sathish as well as bowlers Ankit Rajpoot and Jaydev Unadkat, with the latter being a former player of the squad. They signed one spinner in Manan Sharma.[34] Before the 2017 auctions, they released Morne Morkel, Brad Hogg, Jason Holder, Colin Munro, John Hastings, Jaydev Unadkat, Rajagopal Sathish, Manan Sharma and replacement signing Shaun Tait. From the 2017 Indian Premier League auction, they signed Trent Boult, English all-rounder Chris Woakes, Australian Nathan Coulter-Nile, West Indian Darren Bravo and Jamaican Rovman Powell. The domestic players signed were Rishi Dhawan, Ishank Jaggi, Sayan Ghosh and R Sanjay Yadav. At the time, Andre Russell was banned for one year for doping; he was replaced by Colin de Grandhomme for the season. In January 2018, they only retained West Indian cricketers Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. Their two-time title winning captain Gautam Gambhir was released. At the auction, they retained Robin Uthappa, Piyush Chawla and Kuldeep Yadav using RTM (Right-To-Match) card. KKR also bought back their impressive opener Chris Lynn and uncapped Indian batsman Ishank Jaggi. Other uncapped batsmen bought were Nitish Rana, Shubman Gill,  Cameron Delport, Rinku Singh and Apoorv Wankhade. They also bought West Indian uncapped all-rounder Javon Searles and uncapped Indian all-rounders Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi. Other signings were veteran Indian wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik, Australian pace bowlers Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Johnson and former Knight Riders player Vinay Kumar.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 March 2018, Dinesh Karthik was appointed as the captain of KKR for IPL 2018 and Robin Uthappa was named vice-captain.[35] Mitchell Starc was ruled out before the season due to injury and Tom Curran was announced as his replacement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Knight Riders qualified for the Champions League Twenty20 in 2011, 2012 and 2014. The latter was the last edition of the tournament before it being permanently called off.

Nuclear families typically center on a married couple;[1] the nuclear family may have any number of children. There are differences in definition among observers; some definitions allow only biological children that are full-blood siblings,[2] but others allow for a stepparent and any mix of dependent children including stepchildren and adopted children.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily structures of a married couple and their children were present in Western Europe and New England in the 17th century, influenced by church and theocratic governments.[5] With the emergence of proto-industrialization and early capitalism, the nuclear family became a financially viable social unit.[6] The term nuclear family first appeared in the early twentieth century. Alternative definitions have evolved to include family units headed by same-sex parents[1] and perhaps additional adult relatives who take on a cohabiting parental role;[7] in the latter case, it also receives the name of conjugal family.[1]\\r\\nThe concept that narrowly defines a nuclear family is; central to stability in modern society that has been promoted by familialists who are social conservatives in the United States, and has been challenged as historically and sociologically inadequate to describe the complexity of actual family relations.[8] In \\"Freudien Theories of Identification and Their Derivatives\\" he states \\"Very little is known about the extent variation in the behavior of fathers and mothers towards sons and daughters, and even less about the possible effects on such differential treatment.\\" Little is known about how parental behavior and identification processes work, and how children interpret sex role learning. In his theory he uses \\"identification\\" with the father in the sense that the son will follow the sex role provided by his father and then for the father to be able identify the difference of the \\"cross sex\\" parent for his daughter.\\r\\nHistorians Alan Macfarlane and Peter Laslett postulated that nuclear families have been a primary arrangement in England since the 13th century . This primary arrangement was different than the normal arrangements in Southern Europe, in parts of Asia, and the Middle East where it was common for young adults to remain in or marry into the family home. In England multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, \\"the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving.\\"[9] Berge also mentions that this could be one of the reasons why the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries. However, the historicity of the nuclear family in England has been challenged by Cord Oestmann. [10]\\r\\nAs a fertility factor, single nuclear family households generally have a higher number of children than co-operative living arrangements according to studies from both the Western world[11] and India.[12]\\r\\nThere have been studies done that shows a difference in the number of children wanted per household according to where they live. Families that live in rural areas wanted to have more kids than families in urban areas. A study done in Japan between October 2011 and February 2012 further researched the effect of area of residence on mean desired number of children.[13] Researchers of the study came to the conclusion that the women living in rural areas with larger families were more likely to want more children, compared to women that lived in urban areas in Japan.\\r\\nMerriam-Webster dates the term back to 1947,[14] while the Oxford English Dictionary has a reference to the term from 1925; thus it is relatively new.\\r\\nIn its most common usage, the term nuclear family refers to a household consisting of a father, a mother and their children[15] all in one household dwelling.[14] George Murdock, an observer of families, offered an early description:\\r\\nThe family is a social group characterized by common residence, economic cooperation and reproduction. It contains adults of both sexes, at least two of whom maintain a socially approved sexual relationship, and one or more children, own or adopted, of the sexually cohabiting adults.[16]\\r\\nMany individuals are part of two nuclear families in their lives: the family of origin in which they are offspring, and the family of procreation in which they are a parent.[17]\\r\\nWhile the phrase dates approximately from the Atomic Age, the term \\"nuclear\\" is not used here in the context of nuclear warfare or nuclear power, but instead originates in the same root as nuclear fission, the word \\"nuclear\\" originating in the Lating nucleus, itself originating in the Latin nux, meaning \\"nut\\", i.e. the core of something ÿ thus, the nuclear family refers to all members of the family being part of the same core rather than directly to atomic weapons.\\r\\nAn extended family group consists of non-nuclear (or \\"non-immediate\\") family members considered together with nuclear (or \\"immediate\\") family members.\\r\\nIn 2005, information from the United States Census Bureau showed that 70% of children in the US live in traditional two-parent families,[18] with 66% of those living with parents who were married, and 60% living with their biological parents. The information also explained that \\"the figures suggest that the tumultuous shifts in family structure since the late 1960s have leveled off since 1990\\".[19]\\r\\nWhen considered separately from couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children, the United States traditional nuclear families appear to constitute a minority of households ÿ with a rising prevalence of other family arrangements. In 2000, nuclear families with the original biological parents constituted roughly 24.10% of American households, compared with 40.30% in 1970.[18] Roughly two-thirds of all children in the United States will spend at least some time in a single-parent household.[20] According to some sociologists, \\"[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today.\\" (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced[by whom?], postmodern family, intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children.\\"[18] Traditional nuclear family households are now less common compared to household with couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children.\\r\\nIn the UK, the number of nuclear families fell from 39.0% of all households in 1968 to 28.0% in 1992. The decrease accompanied an equivalent increase in the number of single-parent households and in the number of adults living alone.[21]\\r\\nAccording to some sociologists, \\"[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today.\\" (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced[by whom?], postmodern family, intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children.\\"[18]\\r\\nProfessor Wolfgang Haak of Adelaide University, detects traces of the nuclear family in prehistoric Central Europe. A 2005 archeological dig in Elau in Germany, analyzed by Haak, revealed genetic evidence suggesting that the 13 individuals found in a grave were closely related. Haak said, \\"By establishing the genetic links between the two adults and two children buried together in one grave, we have established the presence of the classic nuclear family in a prehistoric context in Central Europe.... Their unity in death suggest[s] a unity in life.\\"[22] This paper does not regard the nuclear family as \\"natural\\" or as the only model for human family life. \\"This does not establish the elemental family to be a universal model or the most ancient institution of human communities. For example, polygamous unions are prevalent in ethnographic data and models of household communities have apparently been involving a high degree of complexity from their origins.\\"[22] In this study evidence suggests that the nuclear family was embedded with an extended family.

Interpretation of events at Waterloo Creek was raised during an Australian controversy known as the \\"history wars\\" which commenced in the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Sydney mounted police detachment was dispatched by acting Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass, to track down the Namoi, Weraerai and Kamilaroi people who had killed five stockmen in separate incidents on recently established pastoral runs on the upper Gwydir River area of New South Wales.[2] After two months the mounted police, consisting of two sergeants and twenty troopers led by Major James Nunn, arrested 15 Aborigines along the Namoi River. They released all but two, one of whom was shot whilst attempting to escape.[3] The main body of Kamilaroi eluded the troopers, thus Major Nunns party along with two stockmen pursued the Kamilaroi for three weeks from present-day Manilla on the Namoi River north to the upper Gwydir River.[4] On the morning of 26 January in a surprise attack on Nunns party, Corporal Hannan was wounded in the leg with a spear and subsequently four or five Aborigines were shot dead in retaliation.[4] The Aborigines fled down the river as the troopers regrouped, rearmed and pursued them led by the second-in-command, Lieutenant George Cobban. Cobban's party found their quarry about a mile down the river at a point now known as Waterloo Creek, where a second engagement took place.[4] The encounter lasted several hours and no Aborigines were captured.[5]\\r\\nAs there had been no declaration of martial law or other authorising legislation, the police lacked authority to use more than reasonable force proportionate to any risk to the safety of persons or property. Nobody had a licence to kill.[6]\\r\\nThe troopers may therefore have used disproportionate force directed towards individuals who posed no risk to anybody or anything.\\r\\nThere was a suspicion that the troopers might have acted as an ill-disciplined military force rather than as a regular police force.[6]\\r\\nOn 5 March 1838, Nunn submitted a report on his expedition to the newly arrived Governor Gipps.\\r\\nWithin the following month the Colonys Executive Council (the Colonial government constituted by the Governor and his advisers) accepted a recommendation of their Attorney General, Mr J. H. Plunkett, that there be an official inquiry into the expedition, including the Aboriginal deaths.\\r\\nThe colonial government and the Colonial Office in England were both conscious of a need to extend the rule of law to Aborigines as well as other British subjects in the Colony.\\r\\nOn 6 April 1838 the Executive Council decided to issue regulations in the form of a government notice announcing that there would be an inquiry (that is, a coronial inquiry) into the death of any Aboriginal at the hands of a Colonist in the same way as that held when the death of a Colonist occurred through violence or suddenly. However, the decision to publish this Inquiry notice was delayed, with the Executive Council deciding to defer publication until after \\"public excitement\\" (about the Myall Creek murderers' executions) had abated.\\r\\nOn 14 August 1838 the Legislative Council appointed a Committee of Inquiry into the present state of Aborigines, to be presided over by the Anglican Bishop, William Broughton.\\r\\nGippss own inquiry into the Nunn expedition was delayed. He claimed to be unable to produce eyewitness evidence from mounted police owing to demands on police attendance elsewhere, and he could not afford to alienate the police volunteers upon whom policing then depended.[citation needed]\\r\\nAdditionally, Colonists away from urban areas were tending to take the law into their own hands.[7]\\r\\nSome argue that there was a breakdown in law and order, affecting the capacity of the NSW Government to govern.[6]\\r\\nAlthough the Nunn inquiry was reactivated on 22 July 1839 at the Merton Courthouse, New South Wales, there were no convictions and the matter was dropped. The only eyewitness accounts of the fatal main engagement were provided by Lieutenant Cobban and Sergeant John Lee. Its outcome did not result in any further judicial proceedings. [6]\\r\\nAttorney General Plunkett was reluctant to prosecute any of Nunns expeditionary force, due to the time delays, the unavailability of reliable evidence and popular opposition.\\r\\nThe Executive Council decided to take no further action. It accepted that the Aboriginal deaths at Waterloo Creek were the consequence of the police, led by a military officer, acting honestly even if mistakenly or unwisely, under orders and in execution of their duty, to repel an \\"aggressive attack\\" by Aboriginals.[6]\\r\\nLieutenant Cobban claimed he rode to the rear of the group and found a large cache of Aboriginal weapons in the bush and secured them.[4] When he returned to the river, he admitted to seeing two Aborigines being shot, trying to escape and believed that at most three or four Aborigines had been killed in the conflict.[4]\\r\\nSergeant John Lee was with the main detachment of mounted police that pursued the Aborigines into the river. He claimed that forty to fifty Aborigines were killed.[8]\\r\\nMore recently, historians and other commentators have offered varying accounts of the site of the conflict and the number of casualties.\\r\\nCoordinates: 294736S 1492712E? / ?29.79333S 149.45333E? / -29.79333; 149.45333","input":"Who was involved in the waterloo creek massacre?"},{"output":"Sunday, April 13, 1958","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puerto Rican Day Parade (also known as the National Puerto Rican Day Parade) takes place annually in the United States along Fifth Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York.

This move, part of the mission of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York (esp., Cardinal Spellman and Ivan Illich) represented a shift away from earlier attempts at \\"Yankeefication\\" toward culturally specific expressions based on traditional fiestas patronales.[5] In 1995, the parade became incorporated as the National Puerto Rican Day Parade and expanded beyond the parade venue itself. The parade now hosts over seven major events throughout the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are dozens of other events that also take place the weekend of the parade that are not sponsored by the National Parade's corporation. One of the longest running is the street fair held one day prior to the parade. Though the size has changed over the years the heart of the parade has always been at 116th Street between Lexington and Second Avenues. In addition to the parade in New York City, there are currently over fifty smaller parades that take place throughout the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parade has attracted many New York politicians including mayor Michael Bloomberg, former mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Senator Charles Schumer, as well as many political candidates running for office and looking for voters in local, state and national elections. In recent years, the parade has honored several Puerto Rican celebrities by naming them \\"International Grand Marshal\\" of the parade including singer Marc Anthony, who participated in the parade along with his ex-wife Jennifer Lopez, and Ricky Martin in 2007 and 2010.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, organizers selected internationally recognized telenovela actor Osvaldo Ros, as the parade's \\"Special Guest Star\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to a National Grand Marshal, a variety of honorees are named for the parade, with titles such as \\"King\\", \\"National Ambassador of La Salsa\\", and \\"National Godmother\\".[7] In June 2004, Puerto Rican rapper Ivy Queen was designated as the \\"Puerto Rico Youth Godmother\\" of the parade.[8] Others to be given such titles include Wisin & Yandel and Willie Col܇n.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parade itself has been featured in an episode of the NBC situation comedy Seinfeld titled \\"The Puerto Rican Day\\". In it, Jerry Seinfeld, George Costanza, Elaine Benes, and Cosmo Kramer get stuck in a traffic jam as a result of the parade. Due to controversy relating to a scene in which Kramer accidentally burns and then stomps on a Puerto Rican flag and is chased by a mob of angry Puerto Ricans, NBC refused to air the episode again.[9] The episode was also withheld from syndication as a result, but has been shown sparingly in syndicated repeats since 2002 and has been released on DVD along with all of the sitcom's episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parade was portrayed in a negative aspect following the controversial 2000 parade in a 2001 episode of the long-running NBC crime series Law & Order titled \\"Sunday in the Park with Jorge\\".

Many confirmed participants such as U.S. Representative Luis Guiterrez and corporate sponsors such as Verizon withdrew their participation and endorsements due to his controversial past. After mounting pressure from both the media, politicians, public officials, and domestic violence organizations, Rios decided to not attend the parade after discussing the matter with his children and U.S. Congresswoman Nydia Velasquez. He was replaced at the last minute by singer Marc Anthony, who was accompanied by his then wife Jennifer Lopez.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn past interviews, actor and comedian John Leguizamo had always claimed Puerto Rican ancestry via his father's side, which was one of the reasons that he was selected as the 2011 Puerto Rican Day Parade Global Ambassador of the Arts.

The Mortal Instruments is chronologically the third series of a proposed five in The Shadowhunter Chronicles but it was the first one published. It follows Clary Fray (who interacts with a group of nephilim known as Shadowhunters) while also discovering her own half-angel heritage. The Shadowhunters protect the world of mundane people who are also called \\"mundies\\" from dark forces from beyond their world.\\r\\nThe book series has become one of the most popular within the young adult genre of paranormal romance/urban fantasy, but Clare did not originally intend to write the series for teens. When she began writing City of Bones, she did not view it as a young adult work, but first and foremost as a fantasy novel, where the main characters just happened to be teenagers. When she was approached by a publisher interested in aging up her characters, she ultimately decided that she \\"wanted to tell a story about characters at that crucial life stage just between adolescence and adulthood, where your choices determine the kind of person you're going to be rather than reflecting who you already are.\\"[1] The decision to launch her novels as Young Adult books has propelled Clare to the top of the Bestsellers list and has established The Shadowhunter Chronicles as some of the most popular works read by a largely young adult audience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClarissa \\"Clary\\" Adele Fray (also referred to as Fairchild and Morgenstern) is the sister of Jonathan Morgenstern and daughter of Valentine Morgenstern and Jocelyn Fairchild. To protect Clary, Jocelyn changes her surname to Fray. Clary is described as having long, curly red hair, freckles, and bright green eyes. She is very small and short, \\"a little over five feet\\" as first described in City of Bones and often viewed as younger than her actual age. In the first book, Clary is 15 years old, approaching 16, which is the age of Isabelle Lightwood. Clary is an artist, and in the first book, City of Bones, it is believed that she is a mundane, an ordinary human, as she first thought of herself. It is later revealed that she is a Shadowhunter, or Nephilim: a human with angelic qualities. Clary is described as being stubborn and often rushes into dangerous situations without considering the consequences. Her best friend in the series is Simon Lewis. He is in love with her but she is romantically involved with Jace (who uses various surnames). Clary is devastated when she is told that Jace is her brother but later learns that this is untrue. Clary discovers she can read ancient runes that are used by angels, and she can create her own runes, an ability that was caused by the extra angel blood her father, Valentine Morgenstern, administered to her while she was in her mother's womb. In the first few books, Clary has a tense relationship with the Lightwoods siblings. Alec Lightwood, Jace's parabatai or best friend, is seemingly jealous of Clary's relationship with Jace since he thinks she is occupying Jace more than she should, while Izzy Lightwood shows hostility towards Clary at the beginning since she thinks Clary is just a normal human being.\\r\\nJonathan Christopher \\"Jace\\" Herondale (also referred to as Wayland, Morgenstern, and Lightwood, known as the brother of Clarissa \\"Clary\\" Adele Fray in early series) is described as being tall and muscular with scars across his golden skin from faded magical marks called Runes. He has wavy blond hair and golden eyes, and, like Clary, is a Shadowhunter. Jace is among the Nephilim's best fighters, since Izzy stated that he's killed more demons than anybody his age, and readily defends his family. Jace is often flirty and insensitive, and is described as projecting a false arrogance due to an insecurity that he is not good enough. Throughout the books, Jace's biological family remains unknown although he refers to Isabelle, Alec, and Max as his siblings, and Maryse and Robert Lightwood as his parents. In City of Bones, he believes he is a Wayland but at the end of the book Valentine Morgenstern falsely tells him that he is Jace's father. In City of Glass, Jace learns that his biological father is actually Stephen Herondale. He goes by the surname of his adoptive family, the Lightwoods but changes it back to Herondale upon learning more about his true father. Like Clary, he has special powers which make him swift and graceful, caused by the extra angel blood he received while in his mother's womb. His parabatai is Alec Lightwood. Parabatai refers to a pair of Nephilim warriors who fight together as lifelong partners; this is represented as a permanent rune that allows both individuals to be connected to each other.\\r\\nSimon Lewis (also referred to as Lovelace) is a tall, thin boy with a mop of brown hair, brown eyes, and wears glasses. He often wears T-shirts with gamer slogans. In City of Lost Souls, Simon describes himself as being a \\"hipster,\\" but his best friend, Clary, refers to him as a \\"geek\\". Simon is the only character to begin life as an ordinary human (called a mundane), but in City of Ashes he is transformed into a vampire. After becoming a vampire, he never ages and physically will remain 16 years old. He gets taken care of by Raphael Santiago. Valentine Morgenstern stabs Simon in the throat and slits his wrists for the one-fourth vampire blood needed to convert the Mortal Sword. Jace finds Simon and cuts his own wrist to let Simon drink his blood, thus resulting in Simon becoming a Daylighter. Simon is quirky and caring, often putting other people before himself. In City of Fallen Angels, Simon finds himself in a love triangle with the characters of Maia Roberts and Isabelle Lightwood; however, in City of Lost Souls he chooses Isabelle over Maia.\\r\\nIsabelle \\"Izzy\\" Sophia Lightwood is a sixteen years old Shadowhunter that is described as tall, thin, and beautiful. She has long black hair and dark brown eyes, and is often carrying her trademark gold electrum whip, as shown in City of Bones, where Izzy attracted a shape-shifter blue-haired demon in the Pandemonium. Isabelle is described as being incredibly girly but with a fierce attitude. She is often considered flirty and never seems committed in relationships. In City of Lost Souls, she admits to being in love with Simon Lewis and in City of Heavenly Fire she becomes Simon Lewis' girlfriend.\\r\\nAlexander \\"Alec\\" Gideon Lightwood is the oldest Lightwood sibling. Alec is a Shadowhunter with floppy black hair and blue eyes. He is described as being quiet but protective of his younger siblings: Isabelle and Max, the latter of whom dies in City of Glass. Alec believes he is in love with Jace, his best friend and parabatai in the first book, City of Bones, until he meets Magnus Bane. In City of Glass, Alec kisses Magnus in front of his parents, revealing to them that he is homosexual. In City of Fallen Angels and City of Lost Souls, Alec becomes insecure about his and Magnus' relationship because of Magnus' immortality and considerable romantic history. This insecurity leads him to consider turning Magnus into a mortal against his will, which causes Magnus to end their relationship in City of Lost Souls. However, Magnus and Alec eventually reconcile in City of Heavenly Fire.\\r\\nMagnus Bane is the freewhelmingly bisexual High Warlock of Brooklyn. Magnus is an approximately 400-year-old warlock who appears to be 19. He is tall and thin with Asian features, jet black hair, and amber and green cat eyes. Magnus Bane is often described as glittery, and he throws countless parties with Downworlders. Magnus is involved with Jocelyn, Clary's mom, to erase Clary's memories of the Shadowhunter world. Magnus begins a relationship with Alec Lightwood, therefore he feels obliged to become the New York Shadowhunters' \\"pet\\" warlock to impress Alec. Magnus appears in the prequel to The Mortal Instruments  The Infernal Devices  and there is a series of 10 short stories describing some of the events that occurred in Magnus Bane's long life titled The Bane Chronicles. In The Bane Chronicles, Magnus is also romantically involved with a vampire named Camille.\\r\\nLuke Garroway, born Lucian Graymark , is a former Shadowhunter and a former member of the circle. When he was younger he was best friends and parabatai with Valentine. However he was soon betrayed by Valentine who led him into a trap where he was bitten by a werewolf, causing him to become one. He was the leader of the Manhattan werewolf pack, until Maia Roberts earned the title herself. His fianc is Jocelyn Fairchild and is Clary's step-father. He is described as calm, level-headed and righteous. He is also fiercely loyal to his loved ones.\\r\\nJocelyn Fray (Fairchild) is a Shadowhunter, a former member of the circle, and the mother of Clary and Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern. She was once married to Valentine but following the birth of their first child, Jonathan, she learned that Valentine mixed demon blood into her food, thus making Jonathan into a monster. Valentine again mixed angel blood into Jocelyn's food, unaware that she was pregnant with Clary. After he faked his and Jonathan's deaths, Jocelyn left Idris and moved to Brooklyn where she gave birth to Clary. Every two years Jocelyn had Magnus Bane cast a block on Clary's \\"Sight\\" or \\"inner eye,\\" to prevent her from seeing the Shadow world. In City of Bones she self-induces a coma to prevent Valentine learning the whereabouts of the Mortal Cup. She is reawakened in City of Glass. She is currently engaged to her childhood friend, Luke Garroway. Her current surname, Fray is revealed to be a portmanteau of her initial maiden name, Fairchild, and that of Tessa Gray, a warlock seen in City Of Heavenly Fire, and the prequel series, The Infernal Devices.\\r\\nJonathan Christopher (Sebastian) Morgenstern is Clary's brother. Like her, he is a Shadowhunter but he was born with demon blood in his veins. It was administered to him by his father, Valentine, while his mother, Jocelyn, was pregnant. Jonathan is described as having pitch black eyes with no whites (as a baby, but when he is older, they are simply black on the inside), a sharply angled face, and blonde, almost-white hair. At the end of City Of Heavenly Fire the evil is burnt out of him, and his face becomes rounder and his eyes turn green. He dies soon after admitting and apologizing for his wrongdoings to Clary and their mother.\\r\\nCity of Bones was highly popular at the time of release, reaching #8 on the New York Times Best Seller list (Children's books) in April 2007.[2] City of Ashes was one of the YALSA's top ten teen books for 2009.[3]\\r\\nPublishers Weekly commented that it \\"is a sprawling urban fantasy packed with just about every type of creature known to the genre\\".[4] Locus praised the book as \\"a highly readable first novel\\".[5] Booklist said that there was \\"plenty of romance, loss, honor, and betrayal to make the journey worthwhile. An experienced storyteller, Clare moves the plot quickly to a satisfying end.\\"[6] School Library Journal said \\"Though the story is hampered by predictability and overblown writing, Clare continues her talent for mixing hip, modern humor with traditional fantasy, and fans eagerly awaiting the series conclusion should come away more than satisfied.\\"[7] A review in the School Library Journal noted that the book contained a variety of narrative flaws including characters that were \\"sporadically characterized\\" and whose behavior was predictable. In spite of this they noted that the book was entertaining and would leave readers anticipating the next installment.[8] The series has been in the New York Times Best Sellers List for 102 consecutive weeks as of September 5, 2013, and No. 1 for 9 weeks straight, knocking series such as The Hunger Games and Percy Jackson and The Olympians off the top spot.[citation needed] The last time The Mortal Instruments spent 100 consecutive weeks on the best sellers list was in May 2012. On August 29, 2013, City of Bones topped the USA Todays Best Sellers List, which made it the Best Seller Book of the country at the time. Four other Mortal Instruments books also made the list. City of Ashes was No. 8, City of Glass was No. 20, City of Fallen Angels was 35 and City of Lost Souls was No. 46.[9]\\r\\nThe main theme revolving around each of her works is the idea of self-acceptance and coming into ones own in relation to the choices we make and the consequences that follow. Clare focuses on heavy subjects throughout her novels. She explores sexual orientation through several main characters who are homosexual or bisexual (i.e. Alec in The Mortal Instruments; Magnus Bane in both The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices), hones in on shifting family dynamics and the ways that family ultimately take priority, and infuses a few multicultural characters (Magnus is half Indonesian, half Dutch; Jem of The Infernal Devices is half Chinese;[10] Maia Roberts, the leader of New York werewolf pack, is biracial) into a plot filled with a multiplicity of characters.\\r\\nIn City of Ashes, the Faerie Realm and its inhabitants are characters from Holly Black's faerie series, beginning with Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale. Also, the characters Val and Luis from Valiant: A Modern Tale of Faerie appear in another scene in that book. Within Holly Black's third book, Ironside: A Modern Faery's Tale, there is a reference to the Mortal Cup mentioned in the Mortal Instruments series.\\r\\nClare delved deeply into world mythology in order to build the Shadowhunter world featured in The Mortal Instruments, The Infernal Devices, and all other offshoots of the series. There are strong influences from Paradise Lost and The Inferno; while there are many references to Western religious mythology, Clare also studied world mythology deeply, specifically demonic myth featured in Japanese, Tibetan, and other Eastern cultural texts. Her references to angels and nephilim throughout the series also come from this study of world religions and folklore. These myths were then adapted to fit into her stories.[1]\\r\\nCassandra Clare has written a series of prequels called The Infernal Devices set in the same universe as The Mortal Instruments, but in Victorian London. This series consists of three books: Clockwork Angel, published on August 31, 2010, Clockwork Prince, published December 6, 2011, and Clockwork Princess, published March 19, 2013.[11] There is a sequel series to The Infernal Devices called The Last Hours set in the same universe detailing the adventures of the next generation of Shadowhunters almost two decades after the events of Clockwork Princess. The series will consist of three books: Chain of Thorns, Chain of Gold, and Chain of Iron.[12] In reading the prequel series, readers will find strong connections between the main characters in The Mortal Instruments and the protagonists of The Infernal Devices, not just in similarity of characterization but in actual familial connections. First editions of The Clockwork Princess, the final book in this trilogy, include a family tree that links the characters in The Infernal Devices with the generations of The Mortal Instruments and The Dark Artifices.[13] One of the main characters from The Infernal Devices also takes part in the last three Mortal Instruments books (with another one joining in the last book), in addition to Magnus Bane, who takes part in all Mortal Instruments and Infernal Devices books.\\r\\nCassandra Clare has announced a new series of sequels called The Dark Artifices set in the same universe as The Mortal Instruments, but five years in the future. This series will be a trilogy with many new characters (plus some from City of Heavenly Fire) and the focus will shift from New York to the Los Angeles Institute. The first book, Lady Midnight, was published on March 8, 2016. The second book, Lord of Shadows was released on May 23, 2017. The Queen of Air and Darkness is set to be published in 2019.[14][15]\\r\\nCassandra Clare, Sarah Rees Brennan and Maureen Johnson have written a complementary series of ten short stories called The Bane Chronicles that recount the experiences of the Warlock Magnus Bane character from The Mortal Instruments series. This series has been published over the course of 2013 and 2014 and consists of \\"What Really Happened in Peru\\", \\"The Runaway Queen\\", \\"Vampires, Scones, and Edmund Herondale\\", \\"The Midnight Heir\\", \\"The Rise of the Hotel Dumort\\", \\"Saving Raphael Santiago\\", \\"The Fall of The Hotel Dumort\\", \\"What to Buy the Shadowhunter Who Has Everything (And Who You're Not Officially Dating Anyway)\\", \\"The Last Stand of the New York Institute\\", and \\"The Course of True Love (and First Dates)\\".[16] Cassandra Clare and Sarah Rees Brennan also wrote a next series of books called The Shadowhunter Academy that is based on Simon Lewis, Clary's best friend and Isabelle's boyfriend as he journeys to become a Shadowhunter. The series consists of ten books that will be released over the course of 2015. The books and release dates are: Welcome to Shadowhunter Academy, February 17; The Lost Herondale, March 17; The Whitechapel Fiend, April 21; Nothing but Shadows, May 19; The Evil We Love, June 16; Pale Kings and Princes, July 21; Bitter of Tongue, August 18; The Fiery Trial, September 15; Born to Endless Night, October 20; and Angels Twice Descending, November 17.[17]\\r\\nThere were graphic novel versions of her series released within the past several years to appeal to an even wider audience.

The film was due to start production in 2013, but was delayed to 2014 after the first film failed to recoup its budget. On October 12, a TV series adaptation was announced, and producers deemed it unlikely that the film series would continue.[21][22]\\r\\nOn October 12, 2014 at Mipcom, Constantin confirmed that The Mortal Instruments will be adapted as a television series, and has hired showrunner in Los Angeles to start production for next year on at least two or three international shows.[23] Constantin Film and TV head Martin Moszkowicz told The Hollywood Reporter that \\"It actually makes sense to do (the novels) as a TV series. There was so much from the book that we had to leave out of the Mortal Instruments film. In the series we'll be able to go deeper and explore this world in greater detail and depth.\\"[24] The producers hope to adapt the entire book series if the TV adaptation proves successful.[23] It has been announced that episodes will be one hour long and start from the beginning of the series with City of Bones. In February 2015, Cassandra Clare announced via Twitter that the television series will be called Shadowhunters rather than The Mortal Instruments. The series will begin production in Vancouver in June, and will air in 2016 on a new network called Freeform, which will be the successor to ABC Family. A casting call has been posted in which the characters are aged up (18-early 20s). Dominic Sherwood has been cast as Jace in the series. Katherine McNamara will play Clarissa Fray.

He was the first human to journey into outer space when his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth on 12 April 1961.\\r\\nGagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation's highest honour. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when the MiG-15 training jet he was piloting crashed. The Fdration Aronautique Internationale awards the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino (renamed Gagarin in 1968 after his death), near Gzhatsk, on 9 March 1934.[1] His parents worked on a collective farm:[2] Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and bricklayer, and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a milkmaid.[note 2][3] Yuri was the third of four children: older brother Valentin, older sister Zoya, and younger brother Boris.[4]\\r\\nLike millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10?ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[5] His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war in 1945.[4][6] In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.[5]\\r\\nIn 1950, Gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age 16 as a foundryman at the Lyubertsy Steel Plant near Moscow,[4][6] and also enrolled at a local \\"young workers\\" school for seventh grade evening classes.[7] After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school with honours in moldmaking and foundry work,[7] he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors.[4][6][8] While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly  at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer.[6][8] He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.[5]\\r\\nAfter graduating from the technical school in 1955, the Soviet Army drafted Gagarin.[7] On a recommendation, Gagarin was sent to the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, and soloed in a MiG-15 in 1957.[4][6][7] After graduation, he was assigned to the Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Forces on 5 November 1957; on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.[9]\\r\\nIn 1960, after an extensive search and selection process, Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six, from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics? space was limited in the small Vostok cockpit, and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in) tall.[2]\\r\\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, a Soviet Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\\r\\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.[10]\\r\\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.[11] One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.[12]\\r\\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\\r\\nService in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper... I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[13]\\r\\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being a referee.[14]\\r\\nOn 12 April 1961, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: 椿, Siberian pine or Cedar).[15]\\r\\nThe radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:\\r\\nKorolev: \\"Preliminary stage..... intermediate..... main..... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.\\"\\r\\nGagarin: \\"楾!\\" (Poyekhali!Let's go!).[16]\\r\\nGagarin's informal poyekhali! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc, used to refer to the beginning of the Space Age in human history.[17][18]\\r\\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\\r\\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.[19]\\r\\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune \\"The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows\\" (Russian: \\"˾ҷ ְ, ˾ҷ \\").[20][21] The first two lines of the song are: \\"The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky\\".[22] This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\\r\\nSome sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, \\"I don't see any God up here.\\" However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight.[23] In a 2006 interview, Gagarin's friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words, and that the quote originated from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state's anti-religion campaign, saying \\"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any god there.\\"[24] Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child, and a 2011 Foma magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox church in Star City saying, \\"Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house.\\"[25]\\r\\nGagarin's flight was a triumph for the Soviet space program. The announcement on the Soviet radio was made by Yuri Levitan, the same speaker who announced all major events in the Great Patriotic War. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of Moscow to the Kremlin where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, by Nikita Khrushchev.[26]\\r\\nLater on, Gagarin toured widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Egypt[27] and Finland to promote the Soviet Union's accomplishment of putting the first human in space. He visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 mission, going to London and Manchester.[28][29]\\r\\nThe sudden rise to fame took its toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a \\"sensible drinker\\", his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.[4][8]\\r\\nIn 1962, he began serving as a Deputy to the Soviet of the Union,[30] and was elected to the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Forces on 12 June 1962, and received the rank of colonel on 6 November 1963.[9] Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin's protests that additional safety precautions were necessary.[31] When Komarov's flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\\r\\nOn 20 December 1963, Gagarin had become Deputy Training Director of the Star City cosmonaut training base.[32] Two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the SSSU, but this time to the Soviet of Nationalities.[30] Next year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot.[33] On 17 February 1968 he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration, passing with flying colors.[34][35]\\r\\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\\r\\nGagarin is survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Yelena and Galina.\\r\\nThe cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.\\r\\nSoviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.[36]\\r\\nAnother theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.[37] A similar theory, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.[38]\\r\\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.[39]\\r\\nIn April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified. Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a \\"super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,\\" or to avoid \\"entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover\\".[40]\\r\\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov, who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard \\"two loud booms in the distance.\\" Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 'Flagon') was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and \\"without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier.\\" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing.[41] In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network RT, Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, \\"unauthorized\\" Su-15 flying in the area. Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres (1,480?ft) and that, while running afterburners, \\"the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10ÿ15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin ÿ a deep spiral, to be precise ÿ at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\\" As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health.[42][43]\\r\\nIn 1957, while at the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, Gagarin met Valentina Ivanovna Goryacheva,[3] a medical technician graduate of the Orenburg Medical School.[6][8] They were married on 7 November 1957, the same day Gagarin graduated from Orenburg, and they have two daughters.[3][6]\\r\\nYelena Yurievna Gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the Director-General of the Moscow Kremlin Museums since 2001.[44][45]\\r\\nGalina Yurievna Gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow.[44][46]\\r\\nAside from his short stature at 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in), one of Gagarin's most notable traits was his smile.[47] Many commented on how Gagarin's smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success.[29]\\r\\nGagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him. Gagarin stated, \\"If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I.\\" Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.[29]\\r\\nSergei Korolev, one of the masterminds behind the early years of the Soviet space program, later said that Gagarin possessed a smile \\"that lit up the Cold War\\".[48]\\r\\n12 April, the date of Gagarin's space flight, has been commemorated as a special date. Since 1962, it has been celebrated in the USSR and later in Russia and other post-Soviet states as the Cosmonautics Day. In 2011 it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.[49]\\r\\nSince 2001, Yuri's Night, an international celebration, is held every 12 April to commemorate milestones in space exploration.\\r\\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin. The Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City was named in 1969. The launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome from which Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1 were launched, is now known as Gagarin's Start. Gagarin Raion in the Sevastopol city (Ukraine) was named after him during the period of the Soviet Union. The Air Force Academy was renamed Gagarin Air Force Academy in 1968.\\r\\nGagarin has been honored on the Moon by both astronauts and astronomers. He was honored by the American space program during Apollo 11 in 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left a memorial satchel containing medals commemorating Gagarin and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on the surface.[50][51] In 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin left the Fallen Astronaut at their landing site as a memorial to all the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who died in the Space Race, with Yuri Gagarin listed among 14 others.[52][53] He is memorialized by the official naming of a 265?km crater on the Far Side after him.\\r\\nSeveral statues have been erected in his honor.\\r\\nOn 4 June 1980, a monument to Gagarin was opened on Gagarin Square in Leninsky Avenue, Moscow. The monument is 42.4 m tall and constructed of titanium. Beside the column is a replica of the descent module used by Gagarin.\\r\\nIn 2011 a statue, Yuri Gagarin, was unveiled at the Admiralty Arch end of The Mall in London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Cook. It is a copy of the statue outside Gagarin's former school in Lyubertsy.[54] In 2013 the statue was moved to a permanent location outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.[55]\\r\\nIn 2012, a statue was unveiled at the site of NASA's original spaceflight headquarters on South Wayside Drive in Houston. The sculpture, completed in 2011 by artist/cosmonaut Alexsei Leonov, was a gift to Houston by various Russian organisations. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were present for the dedication.[56]\\r\\nGagarin is memorialized in music, including a cycle of Soviet patriotic songs The Constellation Gagarin (Russian: Ѿ־^ ҷ, tr. Sozvezdie Gagarina) was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov in 1970ÿ1971.[57] The most famous of these songs referred to Gagarin's poyekhali!: He said \\"let's go!\\" He waved his hand.[17][57] He was the inspiration for the pieces \\"Hey Gagarin\\" by Jean Michel Jarre (on Mtamorphoses), \\"Gagarin\\" by Public Service Broadcasting, and \\"Gagarin, I loved you\\" by Undervud.\\r\\nVessels have been named for him. Soviet tracking ship Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin was built in 1971. Armenian airline Armavia named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin's honour in 2011.[58]\\r\\nThere were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to honour the 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver).[59] In 2011, Russia issued a 1,000 ruble coin (gold) and 3 ruble coin (silver) to mark the 50th anniversary of his flight.[60]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Kontinental Hockey League named their championship trophy the Gagarin Cup.[61] In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the #6 most popular space hero, tied with Star Trek's fictional Capt. James T. Kirk.[62] The Russian docudrama, Gagarin: First in Space, was released in 2013.\\r\\nThe 50th anniversary of Gagarin's journey into space was marked in 2011 by tributes around the world. A film titled First Orbit was shot from the International Space Station, combining the original flight audio with footage of the route taken by Gagarin.[63] The Russian, American, and Italian Expedition 27 crew aboard the ISS sent a special video message to wish the people of the world a \\"Happy Yuri's Night\\", wearing shirts with an image of Gagarin.[64]\\r\\nSwiss-based German watchmaker Bernhard Lederer created a limited edition of 50 Gagarin Tourbillons to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight.[65]\\r\\nThe launch of Soyuz TMA-21 on 4 April 2011 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first manned space mission.[66]\\r\\nand others.\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was elected an honorary citizen of the following cities:\\r\\nHe was also awarded the golden keys to the gates of the Egyptian cities Cairo and Alexandria.","input":"Who was the first man to travel in space?"},{"output":"Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg[3] ( /?bu?t?d??d?/; born January 19, 1982) is an American politician serving as the 32nd and current Mayor of South Bend, Indiana since 2012.[4] A member of the Democratic Party, Buttigieg is a graduate of Harvard University, a Rhodes Scholar, and a veteran of the War in Afghanistan.

Buttigieg lost to incumbent Richard Mourdock, garnering 37.5% of the vote.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nButtigieg was commissioned as a Naval intelligence officer in the Naval Reserves in 2009, and deployed to Afghanistan in 2013.[19] After a seven-month deployment, Buttigieg returned to South Bend.[20] He remains a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nButtigieg was elected Mayor of South Bend on November 8, 2011, with 74% of the vote[22] and took office on January 1 as the youngest mayor of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 residents.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was named mayor of the year for 2013 by GovFresh.com, tying with former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg.[24][25] In 2014, The Washington Post called Buttigieg \\"the most interesting mayor you've never heard of\\", citing his age, education, and military background.[22] In 2016, The New York Times published an op-ed praising Buttigieg's work as mayor and boldly asking in the headline if he could eventually be elected as \\"the first gay president.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nButtigieg has made redevelopment a top priority of his administration. One of the signature programs has been the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative, known locally as \\"1,000 Properties in 1,000 Days\\", which is a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city.[27][28] The city had addressed 991 properties as of August 2015.[27] The goal was completed by the scheduled end date for the program, November 24, 2015.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nButtigieg served for seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the Navy Reserves, returning to the United States on September 23, 2014.[30] In his absence, Deputy Mayor Mark Neal, the City Controller for South Bend, served in the role of executive commencing in February 2014. Buttigieg returned to his role as mayor in October 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nButtigieg announced that he would seek a second term on November 18, 2014.[31] The Democratic Party primary was held on May 5, 2015, and Buttigieg won with 78% of the vote.[32] On November 3, 2015, Buttigieg was elected to his second term as mayor of South Bend with over 80% of the vote.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nButtigieg was named a 2014 Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow.[34] He was named a recipient of the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Fenn Award in 2015.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 19, 2016, Reuters reported that South Bend had neighborhoods in which 31% of tested children were diagnosed with elevated lead levels in the blood: a rate six times higher than Flint, Michigan reported the same year.[36] Buttigieg declared in his 2017 State of the City address that \\"the City has no specific officer, staff, or funding for health, [but] we will continue to actively support other health authorities in ensuring we live in a safe environment, especially for children.\\" [37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, Buttigieg authorized the city's first officer of diversity and inclusion, with direction to produce a strategic report on diversity and inclusion in city government.[38] The report was issued on July 15, 2016.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 16, 2017, the Mayor's \\"Smart Streets\\" construction project concluded.  The multi-year $25 million initiative converted many downtown one-way streets to two way use, and added pedestrian and bike friendly amenities.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Buttigieg demoted the first African American police chief of South Bend, Darryl Boykins, and fired police communications director Karen DePaepe, following the revelation of taped telephone conversations between four white South Bend police officers and the spouse of an officer.  The tapes were alleged to contain \\"racist content\\".[41] Buttigieg elected to settle suits brought by Boykins, DePaepe, and the four officers out of court.[42] The Common Council of South Bend sued the Mayor to release at least some of the tapes; this suit is still pending in state court.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Buttigieg's replacement for Boykins as police chief, Ron Teachman, was subject to investigation for allegedly not supporting a fellow police officer during an nearby fight. Local advocates expressed concern that the officer Teachman allegedly failed to assist was African American.  After a report by the Indiana State Police on the incident, Buttigieg concluded there was no discipline required of Chief Teachman, a decision that caused the head of the Board of Public Safety, Pat Cottrell, to resign in protest.[44] Cottrell and the officer Chief Teachman allegedly failed to assist, Lt. David Newton, requested that the report be released, which Mayor Buttigieg declined to do.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, Buttigieg drew national attention for the city's handling of an excessive force and civil rights case involving three South Bend police officers and an innocent African American teen, DeShawn Franklin.  Suspected of a crime he did not commit, Franklin's home was entered at night by the officers without a warrant, and he was punched and Tasered during the encounter, but was ultimately not arrested. Buttigieg's administration offered the teen's family $15,000 in settlement. The family rejected this offer, and the case went to trial. A jury found that the officers had violated Franklin's civil rights, and he was awarded $18.[46][47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 5, 2017, Buttigieg announced his candidacy for Chair of the Democratic National Committee in its 2017 chairmanship election.[49] He \\"built a national profile as an emerging dark horse in the race for the chairmanship with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean.\\"[50] Buttigieg \\"campaigned on the idea that the aging Democratic Party needed to empower its millennial members.\\"[50] He withdrew from the race on the day of the election, in his nomination speech.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 16, 2015, Buttigieg announced in an essay that he is gay.[51] He is the first openly gay executive in Indiana.[52]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2017, Buttigieg announced his engagement to Chasten Glezman.[1]\\r\\nOn June 16, 2018, they were married in a private ceremony.","input":"Who's the mayor of south bend indiana?"},{"output":"1 July 2018","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnrique Pe?a Nieto\\r\\nPRI\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrs Manuel L܇pez Obrador\\r\\nMORENA\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral elections were held in Mexico on 1 July 2018.[1] Voters elected a new President of Mexico to serve a term  of five years and ten months (reduced by two months from the constitutional mandate due to a change in the inauguration date as of 2014),[2] 128 members of the Senate for a period of six years and 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies for a period of three years.  It was one of the largest election days in Mexican history, with most of the nation's states  holding state and local elections on the same day, including nine governorships, with over 3,400 positions subject to elections at all levels of government.[3]  It has been the most violent campaign Mexico has experienced in recent history, with 130 political figures killed since September 2017.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incumbent president Enrique Pe?a Nieto was not constitutionally eligible for a second term. Incumbent members of the legislature are term-limited, thus all members of Congress will be newly elected. As a consequence of the political reform of 2014, the members of the legislature elected in this election will be the first allowed to run for reelection in subsequent elections. The National Electoral Institute (INE) officially declared the new process underway on 8 September 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presidential election was won by Andrs Manuel L܇pez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), running as the candidate of the Juntos Haremos Historia alliance.[4] This is the first time a candidate won an outright majority (according to official vote counts) since 1988,[5], and the first time that a candidate not from the Institutional Revolutionary Party or its predecessors has done so since the Mexican Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country's president is elected by plurality in a single round of voting.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected to three-year terms by two methods; 300 are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, with the remaining 200 elected from five regional constituencies by proportional representation, with seats allocated using the simple quotient and largest remainder method. No party is allowed to hold more than 300 seats.[7] Members may hold office for up to four consecutive terms.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 128 members of the Senate are elected to six-year terms, concurrent with the president, and also elected by two methods, with 96 elected in 32 three-member constituencies based on the states and 32 elected in a single nationwide constituency by proportional representation. In the three-member constituencies, two winning candidates shall be allocated to the party receiving the highest number of votes and one seat to the party receiving the second-highest number of votes.[9] Members may hold office for up to two terms.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n(English: \\"For Mexico to the Front\\")\\r\\n\\r\\nThe center-right National Action Party and the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution and Citizens' Movement ÿ which both nominated Andrs Manuel L܇pez Obrador in the elections of 2006 and 2012 ÿ formed an alliance for the election, in an effort to defeat both the ruling party, the PRI, and the front-runner Andrs Manuel L܇pez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement.[10][11][12][13][14][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 September, the electoral alliance was officially registered with the INE as Frente Ciudadano por Mxico (Citizen Front for Mexico).[14] On 8 December the coalition changed its name to Por Mxico al Frente (Mexico to the Front). The next day, Ricardo Anaya Corts, president of the PAN, resigned from his position and expressed his intent to be the alliance's candidate.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former first lady Margarita Zavala submitted her resignation from the PAN on 6 October, after having been a member for 33 years, and registered as an independent candidate six days later.[17] She sought the presidency through an independent bid, but withdrew on 16 May 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n(English: \\"Everyone for Mexico\\")\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coalition is composed of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, and the PANAL. On 9 August 2017, the PRI revised its requirements for presidential candidates, eliminating the requirement that candidates must have 10 years of party membership, and allowing non-party members to lead the party.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis move benefited finance secretary Jos Antonio Meade Kuribre?a, who is not a member of the PRI,[19] as well as education secretary Aurelio Nu?o Mayer, whose length of membership had been questioned.[18] Meade was considered the favorite, because while the PRI had been dogged by scandal and controversy, Meade had been personally unaffected.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27 November, Meade resigned from cabinet and announced his intention to be the PRI's candidate in the upcoming election.[21] He quickly received the support of President Pe?a Nieto and PRI-linked institutions such as the CTM union.[22] With no challengers, Meade became the presumptive nominee.[23] On 18 February 2018, the PRI held its convention of delegates, where Meade was formally selected as the party's presidential candidate.[24] Meade is the PRI's first presidential candidate in its almost 90-year history not to be a member of the party.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the circumstances of Meade's candidacy, critics compared his selection to the PRI's historical practice of dedazo (\\"tap of the finger\\"), where presidents hand-picked their successor.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coalition was initially named Meade Ciudadano por Mxico (English: Citizen Meade for Mexico), until the INE deemed it unconstitutional to include a candidate's name within the coalition's name, on the grounds that the presidential candidate would receive advertising from every piece of campaign advertising of the coalition used for local candidates. The coalition subsequently changed its name to Todos por Mxico (Everyone for Mexico).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\n(English: \\"Together We Will Make History\\")\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coalition is composed of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), the Labor Party, and the Social Encounter Party.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 December Andrs Manuel L܇pez Obrador registered as the presumptive nominee for MORENA and submitted his resignation as party president. This is L܇pez Obrador's third presidential bid; the previous two attempts were with the PRD. After the 2012 presidential election, L܇pez Obrador left the PRD to found MORENA. This is MORENA's first presidential election. Joining MORENA in the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition is the left-wing Labor Party and the right-wing Social Encounter Party.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in Mexico's modern democratic history, candidates were allowed to run for the presidency as independents.[33] Several people announced their intention to contest the election as an independent candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargarita Zavala, a lawyer, former deputy and wife of former president Felipe Calder܇n, had originally intended to run as the PAN nominee; however, on 6 October, she left the party and launched an independent bid. Explaining her decision, she said that the formation of Por Mxico al Frente meant there would be no internal PAN selection, denying her a chance to be a candidate.[34] Jaime Rodrguez Calder܇n, the independent governor of Nuevo Le܇n, also announced his candidacy,[35] as did Senator Armando Ros Piter.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Indigenous Congress announced on 28 May 2017 the election of Mara de Jes~s Patricio Martnez as their spokeswoman and indigenous representative for the 2018 general election, aiming to obtain an independent candidacy.[37] \\r\\nOnly Zavala gathered enough signatures to appear on the ballot;[38] however, on 10 April the Electoral Court accepted an appeal from Rodrguez and ordered the National Electoral Institute to register him as candidate.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 May Zavala announced she was withdrawing her candidacy.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in the 2006 and 2012 federal elections, the 2018 campaign featured numerous accusations and attack advertisements directed at the leftist frontrunner candidate Andrs Manuel L܇pez Obrador, who contested the elections with the support of his party MORENA. A Red Scare-like campaign was used by the PRI and PAN candidates to convince voters that a L܇pez Obrador victory would turn Mexico into \\"another Venezuela\\".[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech, PRI president Enrique Ochoa Reza?(es) said that \\"if the people from MORENA like Venezuela so much, they should just go and live there\\".[43] The PRI was believed to have hired Venezuelan right-wing political strategist JJ Rend܇n to work in their campaign, as he stated in January that he would do \\"everything within the law to prevent L܇pez Obrador from becoming President\\"; Rend܇n had previously worked for the PRI during Pe?a Nieto's 2012 presidential campaign.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January, former president Felipe Calder܇n shared a video on via social media, in which a Venezuelan citizen living in Mexico warned voters not to vote for L܇pez Obrador, as he would put Mexico in the \\"path to ruin\\" like Chavismo had done in her country. It later surfaced that the woman, whose name is Carmen Martilez, is an actress who previously had uploaded a video in which she asked for street vendors to be \\"exterminated\\".[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat same month, the PRI began to claim that L܇pez Obrador's campaign was supported by \\"Venezuelan and Russian interests\\". L܇pez Obrador dismissed the accusations and later joked about them, calling himself \\"Andrs Manuelovich\\".[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in January, citizens across the country received phone calls originating in the city of Puebla, in which a recorded message warned them not to vote for L܇pez Obrador because he supposedly agreed to sell Mexico's oil to \\"the Russians\\". The MORENA representative in Puebla asked for an investigation into the phone calls.[48][49] In March, telephone company Axtel traced the number that made the calls, revealing it was a number that the government of Puebla (whose governor is from the PAN) controlled. Puebla's government denied the accusations.[50] Also in January, L܇pez Obrador uploaded a video via social media asking president Pe?a Nieto and PRI president Ochoa Reza to \\"calm down\\", and advised them to take some \\"L܇pez Obradordipine\\".[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nA jingle entitled Movimiento Naranja, which was recorded for the political party Movimiento Ciudadano (which is part of the Por Mxico al Frente coalition, along with the PAN and the PRD) and performed by an indigenous child called Yuawi, became viral and Yuawi turned into a celebrity overnight.[52][53] \\r\\nDrawing on its success, the pre-candidate for the Frente, Ricardo Anaya recorded a video in which he performed the song with Yuawi.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nPRI candidate Jos Antonio Meade was accused of plagiarism when it was noted that one of his ads, in which he criticized a \\"populist\\" speech on TV, was identical to an ad that had been used by Justin Trudeau when he became leader of the Liberal Party of Canada in 2013.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in February, the PRI's Enrique Ochoa Reza tweeted that PRI politicians who defected to MORENA as Prietos que no aprietan (Dark-skinned people who can't get a hold) while trying to make a pun on the word PRI-etos (because morena is a synonym for prieto).  The expression was criticized, and Ochoa Reza quickly deleted the tweet as it was interpreted to be racist.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAristegui Noticias published that Ochoa Reza apologized, and also criticized the insensitive expression, additionally commenting that the part que ya no aprietan (who cannot hold) could also be interpreted as misogynistic due to being a double entendre referring to women in relation to the number of sexual relations they have had in their lifetime. Ochoa Reza's tweet apologized to dark-skinned people but not to women.[57] Later Sinembargo.mx revealed that Jos Antonio Meade justified Enrique Ochoa's usage of the expression, by saying: uno se excede y es natural (English: one gets-ahead-of-themselves and it is natural) and saying that his quick apology talked positively about him.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) started an official investigation into money-laundering  allegations against Ricardo Anaya.  During the investigation, Santiago Nieto, the ex-chief of FEPADE (the government branch focused on political crimes).[clarification needed]   Nieto the previous October had been controversially removed from his job as chief of FEPADE, coincidentally right after starting an investigation regarding illicit campaign money from the 2012 presidential campaign that allegedly was received by Pe?a Nieto and by the future president of Pemex, Emilio Lozoya, from the Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht.   \\r\\nThe ex-chief of FEPADE said that the accusations against Anaya were minor in comparison to Odebretch and Pe?a Nieto scandal, adding also the same opinion about the money lost by Secretariat of Social Development, to corrupt governors from the PRI such as Javier Duarte, all while Jos Antonio Meade was the man in charge of the Secretariat of Social Development. The scandal is known as La Estafa Maestra (The Master Robbery), and about 435 million pesos were lost.[59] The same week the PRI legislators were criticized for voting for stopping the investigation of Odebretch against the wishes of Mexican people and organizations campaigning against corruption such as Mexicanos contra la corrupci܇n (Mexicans against corruption).[60] The investigation about Odebretch against the  Pemex leader at the time, Lozoya, was legally stopped after a judge controversially ordered it days after.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nSantiago Nieto said that the PGR was being used by Pe?a Nieto's government to tamper with elections and benefit Meade by removing Anaya from the race, complaining that it was a politically motivated use of  law-enforcement agencies, which had made more efforts to investigate Anaya in a month than towards investigating Pe?a Nieto's Odebretch money and Meade's lost Secretariat of Social Development funds over the last six years.  Santiago Nieto said the PGR and FEPADE were only attacking the rivals of the PRI, and  the investigating organizations were not being neutral.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Santiago Nieto would later reveal that Pe?a Nieto's government tried to bribe him to keep him silent, which he refused saying, \\"Sorry, but I can't receive any money from Pe?a Nieto.\\" He received menacing phone messages stating: \\"Death follows you\\" and \\"Words of advice: stay out of Trouble\\", and as a consequence, he  feared for the safety of his, and his family's lives.[63]\\r\\nAdditionally as of 2018, it should be noted, that many of the politicians of the PRI political party who supported Pe?a Nieto during his presidential campaign would be later declared criminals by the Mexican government (some already elected, while others were campaigning concurrently with Pe?a Nieto, and would be elected),[64][65][66] near the end of Pe?a Nieto's time as president. \\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 22 state ex-governors, all members from the PRI, had been accused of misuse of public funds and misdirection of money (with some money speculated to have been directed to the PRI); only five were sent to jail, with PGR receiving criticism for not investigating further.[67] Among the most prominent criminals were: Toms Yarrington from Tamaulipas (along his predecessor Eugenio Hernndez Flores), Javier Duarte from Veracruz,[68]\\r\\nCsar Duarte Jquez from Chihuahua[69] (no family relation between the two Duartes), and Roberto Borge from Quintana Roo, along their unknown multiple allies who enabled their corruption.  While, although Pe?a Nieto has not been found to be an ally of them, by being part of the same political party, there were severely negative consequences to Pe?a Nieto's image as president, as well as  of the PRI.[70] \\r\\nAlso, while not a member of the PRI at the time, Meade's image also received damage, because much of the money was lost while he was in charge of the Secretariat of Social Development, the government ministry that supervises the resources received by each state.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the overwhelming evidence against Csar Duarte, in March 2018 the PGR found him innocent of any crime. The successor governor Javier Corral from the PAN, who previously fought against the Televisa law, gave a similar opinion to Santiago Nieto, saying the PGR was being used to protect the allies of Pe?a Nieto and the PRI, and attack their rivals.[72] \\r\\nL܇pez Obrador said that failure to take action against Duarte was one of the main reasons why Mexicans had lost their faith in the PRI, saying the few ex-governors that were declared criminals were only to a pretense of concern.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter, Meade decided to change his strategy; and due to his poor reception, Ochoa Reza left his position as president of the PRI on 2 May.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 May, Margarita Zavala suspended her presidential campaign.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nSantiago Nieto decided to join AMLO's campaign, with both promising to continue the investigation into the alleged scandal involving Pe?a Nieto, the PRI and Odebretch.[76] \\r\\nMeanwhile, Csar Duarte disappeared before being incarcerated, and was subsequently declared a fugitive from justice by the PGR.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 130 political figures were been killed from when the campaign began in September 2017 until July 2018.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nL܇pez Obrador promised to end many of the benefits received by ex-presidents, particularly the lifelong pension they receive.[78] He added that he would redirect the money saved to be used to help senior citizens.[79] Zavala said she would also attempt to end the practice, though she had not decided how to use the money saved, while Meade and Anaya said they would keep the practice going.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnaya promised to implement a basic income for Mexican citizens,[81] Anaya said Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman supported the idea. While well received, El Economista criticized how Anaya announced it, and called the idea populist.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeade proposed to create an office that would track the unique needs of each individual citizen, in what he would call Registro ~nico de Necesidades de Cada Persona (Unique Register of the Necessities of Each Person). Citizens on social media mocked the idea as absurd and impossible to develop, comparing it to writing letters to Santa Claus or just plainly asking for miracles.[83][84] \\r\\nMeade has supported Pe?a Nieto's energy reforms, saying that \\"everyone wins with the gasolinazo\\", and announcing that if he won he intended to continue it.[85] \\r\\nL܇pez Obrador promised to end the gasolinazos by building two new fuel refineries, which would allow more petroleum to be processed into gasoline domestically, thus lowering the price by not outsourcing the refining to other countries.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnaya promised to investigate and do everything to make sure President Pe?a Nieto is sent to jail for his aforementioned multiple presidential scandals, with L܇pez Obrador agreeing and suggesting to up the ante by also investigating every living former president.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 January, L܇pez Obrador accused the International Monetary Fund of being an accomplice to corruption in Mexican politics and claimed that its policies are in part responsible for poverty, unemployment, and violence in the country. L܇pez Obrador promised that if he won the presidency, Mexico will follow \\"its own agenda\\".[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nL܇pez Obrador called for a change in security strategy and offered the controversial proposal of giving amnesty for drug dealers as a way to combat the drug cartels.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a debate in April, Rodrguez Calder܇n said \\"We have to cut off the hands of those who rob (in public service). It's that simple.\\" He later explained that it was intended to be applied to both criminals and government functionaries involved in acts of corruption citing the application of this measure in Saudi Arabia as an example to reduce corruption and violence. Rodrguez Calder܇n was trending ahead of the other candidates on Twitter during the debate.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nRodrguez Calder܇n later proposed to bring back the death penalty (currently constitutionally abolished in Mexico and enforced for the last time in 1961) for drug traffickers, hijackers, infanticides and serial killers.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe candidate put forward by the National Indigenous Congress and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, Mara de Jes~s Patricio Martnez (Marichuy), alleged that the process for collecting signatures to attain ballot access unfairly benefits the rich. Marichuy said, \\"the INE made a list of telephone makes and models so that you must have at a minimum an Android 5.0 operating system or higher and so many hours to begin with the download of the applications in the devices, we find that the list is not true; we find brands that are not included in the list and of those that are included they dont all work. The download is tedious and can take hours.\\" The INE declared each signature registration would take 4.3 minutes, but each actual signature registration has taken up to 16 hours, or more. 'With these \\"classist, racist and excluding measures,\\" Marichuy said, you realize \\"that this electoral system is not made for those peoples below that govern ourselves and that the laws and institutions of the State are made for those above, for the capitalists and their corrupt political class, resulting in a big simulation.\\" Ultimately she was not able to obtain ballot access. [92]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the FacebookÿCambridge Analytica data scandal, in April 2018, Forbes published information from the British news program Channel 4 News that had mentioned the existence  of proof revealing ties between the PRI and Cambridge Analytica, suggesting a modus operandi similar to the one in the United States. The info said they worked together at least until January.[93][94][95] \\r\\nAn investigation was requested.[96]\\r\\nThe New York Times obtained the 57 page proposal of Cambridge Analytica's proposed collaboration strategy to benefit the PRI by hurting MORENA's candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador; the political party rejected the offer but still paid Cambridge Analytica to not help the other candidates.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2017, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly, stated that the election of a left-wing president in Mexico \\"would not be good for America or Mexico\\". The statement was widely believed to be a reference to L܇pez Obrador, the leftist, frontrunner candidate, and created controversy in Mexico, as it seemed to be an attempt to influence the election against him.[98][99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, US National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster claimed that Russia had launched a campaign to \\"influence Mexicos 2018 presidential election and stir up division\\", without defining the methods of the supposed meddling, or indicating which would be the candidate favored by the Kremlin. The Russian government has denied the claims.[101]\\r\\nPRI president Enrique Ochoa Reza claimed that \\"Russian and Venezuelan interests\\" are supporting L܇pez Obrador's campaign.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nL܇pez Obrador responded that Ochoa's declarations are part of a smear campaign against him,[44] and later posted a video via social media, where he joked about the claims and called himself \\"Andres Manuelovich\\".[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuatemalan right-wing commentator Gloria lvarez embarked on a tour through Mexico, calling L܇pez Obrador a \\"dangerous populist\\" and urging citizens not to vote for him. She was invited to a PAN legislators assembly on 31 January, where she criticized the alliance with the PRD, which she called \\"a party just like MORENA\\".[103][104]\\r\\n\\r\\nUS Senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio asked US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to \\"fight Russian meddling\\" in the Mexican elections.[105] On 2 February during a summit in Mexico, Tillerson stated that Mexico should \\"beware the Russian interference\\".[106] Dr. Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University noted that there has been no evidence of actual Russian tampering in the Mexican electoral process, and considered the accusations \\"absurd\\" given that the Trump administration \\"will not admit Russia interfered in the US election\\".[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg warned about the possibility of the PRI committing electoral fraud, with Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice Universitys Baker Institute in Houston, United States, suggesting that both vote buyout and computer hackings were possible and citing irregularities in the 1988 electoral process. Bloomberg's article also suggested Meade could be receiving unfair help from the over-budget amounts of money spent on publicity by incumbent president Enrique Pe?a Nieto.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Meade spent more money on pre-campaign efforts than L܇pez Obrador and Anaya together, while failing to report where his funds came from; in contrast, L܇pez Obrador has attended the most events while spending the least money and successfully reported better than his rivals where he obtained the resources to pay for those events.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2017, the PRI had faced allegations of electoral fraud concerning the election of Pe?a Nieto's cousin Alfredo del Mazo Maza as Governor of the state of Mexico. Despite the official vote results given by the INE (Electoral National Institute) giving the win to del Mazo, the election was marred by irregularities including reports of vote-buying,[110] spending beyond legal campaign finance limits,[111] and electoral counts that gave del Mazo extra votes that awarded the election to him.[112] In November 2017, left-wing magazine Proceso published an article accusing the PRI of breaking at least 16 state laws during the elections, which were denounced 619 times. They said that all of them were broken in order to favor del Mazo during the election.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nL܇pez Obrador won the election on 1 July 2018 with over 50% of the popular vote.

These five cities, also known as the \\"cities of the plain\\" (from Genesis in the Authorized Version), were situated on the Jordan River plain in the southern region of the land of Canaan. The plain, which corresponds to the area just north of the modern-day Dead Sea,[5] was compared to the garden of Eden[Gen.13:10] as being well-watered and green, suitable for grazing livestock.\\r\\n\\r\\nDivine judgment by God was passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah and two neighboring cities, which were completely consumed by fire and brimstone. Neighboring Zoar (Bela) was the only city to be spared. In Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution.[6][7][Jude 1:7] Sodom and Gomorrah have been used historically and today as metaphors for vice and homosexuality, although a close reading of the text and other Ancient Near Eastern sources suggest that this association may be incorrect.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story has therefore given rise to words in several languages. These include the English word sodomy, which is used in sodomy laws to describe sexual \\"crimes against nature\\", namely anal or oral sex (particularly homosexual), or bestiality.[9][10][11]  Some Islamic societies incorporate punishments associated with Sodom and Gomorrah into sharia.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe etymology of both names is uncertain.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hebrew term for Gomorrah was based on the Semitic root ?-m-r, which means \\"be deep\\", \\"copious (water)\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other stories and historical names which bear a resemblance to the biblical stories of Sodom and Gomorrah. Some possible natural explanations for the events described have been proposed, but no widely accepted or strongly verified sites for the cities have been found. Of the five \\"cities of the plain\\", only Bela, modern-day Zoara, is securely identified, and it remained a settlement long after the biblical period.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancient Greek historiographer Strabo states that locals living near Moasada (as opposed to Masada) say that \\"there were once thirteen inhabited cities in that region of which Sodom was the metropolis\\". Strabo identifies a limestone and salt hill at the south western tip of the Dead Sea, and Kharbet Usdum (Hebrew: ?? ????, Har Sedom or Arabic: ??? ??????, Jabal(u) 'ssudm) ruins nearby as the site of biblical Sodom.[15] Archibald Sayce translated an Akkadian poem describing cities that were destroyed in a rain of fire, written from the view of a person who escaped the destruction; the names of the cities are not given.[16] However, Sayce later mentions that the story more closely resembles the doom of Sennacherib's host.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976 Giovanni Pettinato claimed that a cuneiform tablet that had been found in the newly discovered library at Ebla contained the names of all five of the cities of the plain (Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Bela), listed in the same order as in Genesis. The names si-da-mu [TM.76.G.524] and -ma-ar [TM.75.G.1570 and TM.75.G.2233] were identified as representing Sodom and Gomorrah, which gained some acceptance at the time.[18] However, Alfonso Archi states that, judging from the surrounding city names in the cuneiform list, si-da-mu lies in northern Syria and not near the Dead Sea, and -ma-ar is a variant of -mar, known to represent Emar, an ancient city located near Ebla.[19] Today, the scholarly consensus is that \\"Ebla has no bearing on ... Sodom and Gomorra.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcavations of the areas near Mount Sodom, Tel el-Hammam, and Bab edh-Dhra, lead by Ron Wyatt, uncovered large sulfur chunks embedded within natural rock.[21] However, despite this seemingly incriminating find, these sulfuric deposits are most likely the result of calcite and gypsum reacting with the local strata following a seismic event. Furthermore, Wyatt's reliability is discredited by many scholars, historians, historical organizations, and even religious institutions, including the Israel Antiquities Authority[22] and Answers in Genesis.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain skeptics of the biblical account have theorized that, provided that the cities existed at all, they might have been destroyed by natural disaster. One such idea is that the Dead Sea was devastated by an earthquake between 2100 and 1900 BCE. This might have unleashed showers of steaming tar.[24] It is possible that the towns were destroyed by an earthquake, especially if they lay along a major fault such as the Jordan Rift Valley. There is a lack of contemporary accounts of seismic activity within the necessary timeframe, however, to corroborate this theory.[25] Another idea is that the destruction was caused by the plume of a meteor that impacted in the Alps, as possibly shown in a planisphere inscribed on a cuneiform tablet. [26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub discovered or visited a number of possible sites of the cities, including Bab edh-Dhra, which was originally excavated in 1965 by archaeologist Paul Lapp, and later finished by Rast and Schaub following his death. Other possibilities include Numeira, al-Safi, Feifa, and Khanazir, which were also visited by Schaub and Rast. Each of the sites were near the Dead Sea and showed evidence of burning and traces of sulfur.[27][28] According to Schaub, however, who dug at Bab edh-Dhra, Numeira was destroyed in 2600 BCE at a different time period than Bab edh-Dhra (2350ÿ2067 BCE).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother candidate for Sodom is the Tall el Hammam dig site which began in 2006 under the direction of Steven Collins. Tall el Hammam is located in the southern Jordan river valley approximately 14 kilometres (9?mi) northeast of the Dead Sea, and according to Collins fits the biblical descriptions of the lands of Sodom.[30][31] The ongoing dig is a result of joint cooperation between Trinity Southwest University and the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.[32][better?source?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Eugene H. Merrill believes that the identification of Tall el-Hammam with Sodom would require an unacceptable restructuring of the biblical chronology.[33][34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jewish historian Josephus identifies the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient biblical city of Sodom. He refers to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Book of Genesis is the primary source that mentions the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Siddim is described in Genesis 14:1ÿ17. Sodom and Gomorrah's political situation is described when Lot had encamped in Sodom's territory. At this time, \\"the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly\\". Sodom was ruled by King Bera while Gomorrah was ruled by King Birsha. Their kingship, however, was not sovereign, because all of the river Jordan plain was under Elamite rule for 12 years. The kingdom of Elam was ruled by King Chedorlaomer. In the 13th year of subjugation to Elam, the five kings of the river Jordan plain allied to rebel against Elamite rule. These kings included those of Sodom and Gomorrah as well as their neighbors: King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the unnamed king of Bela (later called Zoar).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, Elam's King Chedorlaomer, gathered additional forces from Shinar, Ellasar and Goyim to suppress this rebellion from the cities of the plain. They waged war in the Vale of Siddim in the 14th year. The battle was brutal with heavy losses in the cities of the plain, with their resultant defeat, Genesis 14:10. Sodom and Gomorrah were spoiled of their goods, and captives were taken, including Lot. The tide of war turned when Lot's uncle, Abraham, gathered an elite force that slaughtered King Chedorlaomer's forces in Hobah, north of Damascus. The success of his mission freed the cities of the plain from under Elam's rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah is told in Genesis 18ÿ19. Three men, thought by most commentators to have been angels appearing as men,[citation needed] came to Abraham in the plains of Mamre. After the angels received the hospitality of Abraham and Sarah, \\"the Lord\\" revealed to Abraham that he would confirm what he had heard against Sodom and Gomorrah, \\"and because their sin is very grievous\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, Abraham inquired of the Lord if he would spare the city if 50 righteous people were found in it, to which the Lord agreed he would not destroy it for the sake of the righteous yet dwelling therein. Abraham then inquired of God for mercy at lower numbers (first 45, then 40, then 30, then 20, and finally at 10), with the Lord agreeing each time.[37] Two angels were sent to Sodom to investigate and were met by Abraham's nephew Lot, who convinced the angels to lodge with him, and they ate with Lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenesis 19:4ÿ5 described what followed, which confirmed its end:\\r\\n\\r\\n4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. 5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him: 'Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.'\\r\\n\\r\\n(NRSV: know them, NIV: can have sex with them, NJB: can have intercourse with them).\\r\\n\\r\\nLot refused to give his guests to the inhabitants of Sodom and, instead, offered them his two virgin daughters \\"which have not known man\\" and to \\"do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes\\". However, they refused this offer, complained about this alien, namely Lot, giving orders, and then came near to break down the door. Lot's angelic guests rescued him and struck the men with blindness and they informed Lot of their mission to destroy the city. Then (not having found even 10 righteous people in the city), they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave. As they made their escape, one angel commanded Lot to \\"look not behind thee\\" (singular \\"thee\\"). However, as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with brimstone and fire from the Lord, Lot's wife looked back at the city, and she became a pillar of salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor and minor prophets in the Hebrew Bible have referred to Sodom and Gomorrah to parallel their prophetic events. The New Testament also contains passages of parallels to the destruction and surrounding events that pertained to these cities and those who were involved. Later deuterocanonical texts attempt to glean additional insights about these cities of the Jordan Plain and their residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses referred to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Deuteronomy 29:22ÿ23:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it. The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfurnothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it.

They were haughty and did detestable things before me.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Amos 4:1ÿ11, God tells the Israelites that although he treated them like Sodom and Gomorrah, they still did not repent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Zephaniah 2:9, Zephaniah tells Moab and Ammon, southeast and northeast of the Dead Sea, that they will end up like Sodom and Gomorrah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Matthew 10:1ÿ15, cf.

Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor'rah than for that town.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Matthew 11:20ÿ24, Jesus prophesies the fate of some cities where he did some of his works (RSV): \\r\\n\\"And you, Caper'na-um, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luke 17:28ÿ30, Jesus compares his second-coming to the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (RSV): \\r\\n\\"Likewise as it was in the days of Lotthey ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built, but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulphur rained from heaven and destroyed them allso will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Romans 9:29, Paul the Apostle quotes Isaiah 1:9 (RSV): \\"And as Isaiah predicted, 'If the Lord of hosts had not left us children, we would have fared like Sodom and been made like Gomor'rah.'\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2 Peter 2:4ÿ10, Saint Peter says that just as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and saved Lot, he will deliver godly people from temptations and punish the wicked on Judgement Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nJude 1:7 records that both Sodom and Gomorrah were \\"giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nRevelation 11:7ÿ8 makes an allegorical use of Sodom when it describes the places where the two witnesses will descend during the Apocalypse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWisdom 10:6ÿ8 refers to the Five Cities:\\r\\n\\r\\nWisdom rescued a righteous man when the ungodly were perishing; he escaped the fire that descended on the Five Cities.

Rabbinic writings affirm that the Sodomites also committed economic crimes, blasphemy and bloodshed.[39] One of the worst was to give money or gold ingots to beggars, after inscribing their names on them, then subsequently refusing to sell them food. The unfortunate stranger would end up starving and after his death, the people who gave him the money would reclaim it.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nJon D. Levenson views a rabbinic tradition described in the Mishnah as postulating that the sin of Sodom was a violation of conventional hospitality in addition to homosexual conduct, describing Sodom's lack of generosity with the saying, \\"What is mine is mine; what is yours is yours\\" (m. Avot 5.10).[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA modern orthodox position is one that holds, \\"The paradigmatic instance of such aberrant behavior is found in the demand of the men of Sodom to 'know' the men visiting Lot, the nephew of Abraham, thus lending their name to the practice of 'sodomy'.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nJay Michaelson proposes a reading of the story of Sodom that emphasizes the violation of hospitality as well as the violence of the Sodomites. \\"Homosexual rape is the way in which they violate hospitalitynot the essence of their transgression. Reading the story of Sodom as being about homosexuality is like reading the story of an ax murderer as being about an ax.\\"[42] Michaelson places the story of Sodom in context with other Genesis stories regarding Abraham's hospitality to strangers, and argues that when other texts in the Hebrew Bible mention Sodom, they do so without commentary on homosexuality. The verses cited by Michaelson include Jeremiah 23:14,[Jeremiah 23:14] where the sins of Jerusalem are compared to Sodom and are listed as adultery, lying, and strengthening the hands of evildoers; Amos 4:1ÿ11 (oppressing the poor and crushing the needy);[Amos 4:1ÿ11] and Ezekiel 16:49ÿ50,[Ezekiel 16:49ÿ50] which defines the sins of Sodom as \\"pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and did toevah before me, and I took them away as I saw fit.\\" Michaelson uses toevah in place of abomination to emphasize the original Hebrew, which he explains as being more correctly translated as \\"taboo\\".[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral theories have been advanced in Christian thought concerning the sin of Sodom. One area of dispute is whether the mob was demanding the homosexual rape of Lot's guests.  A second area of dispute is whether the act of homosexuality or the act of inhospitality and violence towards foreigners is the more significant ethical downfall of Sodom.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first contention between the two positions primarily focuses upon the meaning of the Hebrew verb ??? (yada), translated as know in the King James Version:\\r\\nAnd they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. Genesis 19:5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the word \\"know\\" in the King James Version has been used to refer to sexual intercourse. One example can be found in Genesis 4:1 between Adam and Eve:\\r\\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.Genesis 4:1\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Hebrew scholars believe that yada, unlike the English word know, requires the existence of a \\"personal and intimate relationship\\".[46] For this reason, many of the most popular of the 20th century translations, including the New International Version, the New King James Version, and the New Living Translation, translate yada as \\"have sex with\\" or \\"know ... carnally\\" in Gen 19:5[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who favor the non-sexual interpretation argue against a denotation of sexual behavior in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only 1% (13ÿ14 times)[38][48] of those references are clearly used as a euphemism for realizing sexual intimacy.[49] Instead, those who hold to this interpretation see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCountering this is the observation that one of the examples of know meaning to know sexually occurs when Lot responds to the Gen 19:5 request, by offering his daughters for rape, only three verses later in the same narrative:\\r\\nBehold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing.... Genesis 19:8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a major text in regard to these conflicting opinions:\\r\\nEven as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Jude 1:7\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reference to \\"going after strange flesh\\" is understood in different ways to include something akin to bestiality, having illicit sex with strangers, having sex with angels, but most often God's destruction of the populations of the four cities is interpreted to mean homosexual (same-sex) relations.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany who interpret the stories in a non-sexual context contend that as the word for \\"strange\\" is akin to \\"another\\", \\"other\\", \\"altered\\" or even \\"next\\", the meaning is unclear, and if the condemnation of Sodom was the result of sexual activities perceived to be perverse, then it is likely that it was because women sought to commit fornication with \\"other than human\\" angels,[51] perhaps referring to Genesis 6 or the apocryphal Book of Enoch. Countering this, it is pointed out that Genesis 6 refers to angels seeking women, not men seeking angels, and that both Sodom and Gomorrah were engaged in the sin Jude describes before the angelic visitation, and that, regardless, it is doubtful that the Sodomites knew they were angels. In addition, it is argued the word used in the King James Version of the Bible for \\"strange\\", can mean unlawful or corrupted (Rm. 7:3; Gal. 1:6), and that the apocryphal Second Book of Enoch (different from the Book of Enoch which Jude quotes from) condemns \\"sodomitic\\" sex (2 Enoch 10:3; 34:1),[52] thus indicating that homosexual relations was the prevalent physical sin of Sodom.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the non-sexual and the homosexuality view invoke certain classical writings as well as other portions of the Bible.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this was the sin of Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. Ezekiel 16:49ÿ50\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the nonsexual view focuses on the inhospitality aspect, while the other notes the description detestable or abomination, the Hebrew word for which often denotes moral sins, including those of a sexual nature.[56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Gospel of Matthew (and corresponding verse) when Jesus warns of a worse judgment for some cities than Sodom, inhospitality is perceived by some as the sin, while others see it fundamentally being impenitence:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. Matthew 10:14ÿ15\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nonsexual view focuses on the cultural importance of hospitality, which this biblical story shares with other ancient civilizations, such as Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, where hospitality was of singular importance and strangers were under the protection of the gods.[58] James L. Kugel, Starr Professor of Hebrew Literature at Harvard University suggests the story encompasses the sexual and non-sexual: the Sodomites were guilty of stinginess, inhospitality and sexual license, homo- and heterosexual in contrast to the generosity of Abraham, and Lot whose behavior in protecting the visitors but offering his daughters suggests he was \\"scarcely better than his neighbors\\" according to some ancient commentators, The Bible As It Was, 1997, pp.?179ÿ197.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the Christian Churches that agree on the possible sexual interpretation of know (yada) in this context, there is still a difference of opinion on whether homosexuality is important. On its website, the Anglican Communion presents the argument that the story is \\"not even vaguely about homosexual love or relationships\\", but is instead \\"about dominance and rape, by definition an act of violence, not of sex or love\\". This argument that the violence and the threat of violence towards foreign visitors is the true ethical downfall of Sodom (and not homosexuality), also observes the similarity between the Sodom and Gomorrah and the Battle of Gibeah Bible stories.  In both stories, an inhospitable mob demands the homosexual rape of a foreigner or foreigners.  As the mob instead settles for the rape and murder of the foreigner's female concubine in the Battle of Gibeah story, the homosexual aspect is generally seen as inconsequential, and the ethical downfall is understood to be the violence and the threat of violence towards foreigners by the mob.  This Exodus 22:21ÿ24 lesson is viewed by Anglicans as a more historically accurate way to interpret the Sodom and Gomorrah story.[44][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quran contains twelve references to \\"the people of Lut\\", the biblical Lot, but meaning the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah, and their destruction by God is associated explicitly with their sexual practices:[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 'people of Lot' transgressed consciously against the bounds of God. Lot only prayed to God to be saved from doing as they did. Then Gabriel met Lot and said that he must leave the city quickly, as God had given this command to Lot for saving his life. In the Quran it was written that Lot's wife stayed behind as she had transgressed. She met her fate in the disaster, and only Lot and his family were saved during the destruction of their city,[62] with the understanding that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are identified in Genesis, but \\"the location remains unnamed in the Qur'an\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Quran, surah (chapter) 26 Ash-Shu\`ar' (The Poets)?ÿ\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, We saved him and his family, all. Except an old woman among those who remained behind.\\r\\nCommentary: This was his wife, who was a bad old woman. She stayed behind and was destroyed with whoever else was left. This is similar to what Allah says about them in Surat Al-A\`raf and Surat Hud, and in Surat Al-Hijr, where Allah commanded him to take his family at night, except for his wife, and not to turn around when they heard the Sayhah as it came upon his people. So they patiently obeyed the command of Allah and persevered, and Allah sent upon the people a punishment which struck them all, and rained upon them stones of baked clay, piled up.\\r\\nThe site of the present Dead Sea Works, a large operation for the extraction of Dead Sea minerals, is called \\"Sdom\\" (????) according to its traditional Arab name, Khirbet as-sudm (???? ??????).

The Belmont Conference Center, once a part of the Smithsonian Institution, is in Elkridge, Maryland, 10 miles south of Baltimore, and until the end of 2010 was operated by Howard Community College.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belmont Report[2] summarizes ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects. Three core principles are identified: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Three primary areas of application are also stated. They are informed consent, assessment of risks and benefits, and selection of subjects.\\r\\nAccording to Vollmer and Howard, the Belmont Report allows for a positive solution, which at times may be difficult to find, to future subjects who are not capable to make independent decisions.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belmont Report was first written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Services of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.[5] Prompted in part by problems arising from the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932ÿ1972) and based on the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1974ÿ1978), the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)[6] revised and expanded its regulations for the protection of human subjects 45 CFR part 46 in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In 1978, the Commissions report Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research was released, and it was published in 1979 in the Federal Register.  It was named the Belmont Report, for the Belmont Conference Center, where the National Commission met when first drafting the report.[7]\\r\\nThe Belmont Report is one of the leading works concerning ethics and health care research. It allows for the protection of participants in clinical trials and research studies.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belmont Report explains the unifying ethical principles that form the basis for the National Commissions topic-specific reports and the regulations that incorporate its recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three fundamental ethical principles for using any human subjects for research are:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese principles remain the basis for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) human subject protection regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the Belmont Report continues as an essential reference for institutional review boards (IRBs) that review HHS-conducted or -supported human subjects research proposals involving human subjects, in order to ensure that the research meets the ethical foundations of the regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nApplications of these principles to conduct research requires careful consideration of i) informed consent, ii) risks benefit assessment, and iii)selection of subjects of research.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutlined by Jennifer Sims in her article \\"A brief review of the Belmont Report\\", she states 7 things nurses, as primary caregivers for individuals participating in a study, must do to ensure the rights of the participant is met. \\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers must share the findings of their procedures regardless of them being good or bad results. Also in the case someone did not want to participate in research but would like treatment they cannot be turned away and must be treated with the same standard care.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summary, from the top of the Report:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 12, 1974, the National Research Act (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law, there-by creating the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One of the charges to the Commission was to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines which should be followed to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. In carrying out the above, the Commission was directed to consider: (i) the boundaries between biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine practice of medicine, (ii) the role of assessment of risk-benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research involving human subjects, (iii) appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in such research and (iv) the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belmont Report attempts to summarize the basic ethical principles identified by the Commission in the course of its deliberations. It is the outgrowth of an intensive four-day period of discussions that were held in February 1976 at the Smithsonian Institution's Belmont Conference Center supplemented by the monthly deliberations of the Commission that were held over a period of nearly four years. It is a statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines that should assist in resolving the ethical problems that surround the conduct of research with human subjects. By publishing the Report in the Federal Register, and providing reprints upon request, the Secretary intends that it may be made readily available to scientists, members of Institutional Review Boards, and Federal employees. The two-volume Appendix, containing the lengthy reports of experts and specialists who assisted the Commission in fulfilling this part of its charge, is available as DHEW Publication No. (OS) 78-0013 and No. (OS) 78-0014, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike most other reports of the Commission, the Belmont Report does not make specific recommendations for administrative action by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Rather, the Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety, as a statement of the Department's policy. The Department requests public comment on this recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, 14 other Federal departments and agencies joined HHS in adopting a uniform set of rules for the protection of human subjects, identical to subpart A of 45 CFR part 46 of the HHS regulations.  This uniform set of regulations is the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, informally known as the \\"Common Rule\\". The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) was also established within HHS.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the Belmont Report serves as a historical document and provides the moral framework for understanding regulations in the United States on the use of humans in experimental methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a study by Nancy Shore, community-based participatory researchers were interviewed for their interpretation and critique of the Belmont Report. Interviewees expressed concerns regarding the Belmont Report's ethical principles and interpretations as being one size fits all and advocated researchers to resist the tendency to rely on those principles systematically.[9] It argues that the ethical analysis should be extended to take into account more appropriate factors, such as cultural, gender, ethnic and geographical considerations.[9] Debate continues over the ethics and regulations of research involving human subjects because of discrepancies over the meaning and priority of the Belmont Report's basic ethical principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Notably, the Belmont Report does not specify how its three ethical principles should be weighted or prioritized. According to Albert R. Jonsen, a member of the National Commission that composed the report, the Institutional Review Board is charged with weighing these principles and deciding how they should be applied. Matters become controversial when deciding if the principles should be interpreted as more or less weighty depending upon the particular circumstances of the research in question, if the principles should be viewed as an obligation that society must undertake on behalf of its members,[4] or if it should be viewed as giving absolute priority to respect for persons autonomy over the general good of society.[10]","input":"Who is the author of the belmont report?"},{"output":"July 5, 1989","context":"Seinfeld is an American sitcom that ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City, the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being \\"a show about nothing\\", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.[1]\\r\\nSeinfeld was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment. In syndication, the series has been distributed by Sony Pictures Television since 2002. It was largely written by David and Seinfeld with script writers who included Larry Charles, Peter Mehlman, Gregg Kavet, Carol Leifer, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer, Steve Koren, Jennifer Crittenden, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Dan O'Keefe, Charlie Rubin, Marjorie Gross, Alec Berg, Elaine Pope, and Spike Feresten. A favorite among critics, the series led the Nielsen ratings in seasons six and nine, and finished among the top two (with NBC's ER) every year from 1994 to 1998.\\r\\nSeinfeld is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms ever made. It has been ranked among the best television shows of all time in publications such as Entertainment Weekly,[2] Rolling Stone,[3] and TV Guide.[4][5] The show's most renowned episodes include \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", \\"The Parking Garage\\",[6] and \\"The Contest\\".[7] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America voted it the No. 2 Best Written TV Series of All Time (second to The Sopranos).[8] E! named the series the \\"number 1 reason the '90s ruled\\",[9] and quotes from numerous episodes have become catchphrases in popular culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany characters have made multiple appearances, like Jerry's nemesis Newman and his Uncle Leo. In addition to recurring characters, Seinfeld features numerous celebs who appear as themselves or girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses and other acquaintances. Many actors who made guest appearances became household names later in their careers, or were already well known.\\r\\nMany Seinfeld episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences re-interpreted for the characters' storyline. For example, George's storyline, \\"The Revenge\\", is based on Larry David's experience at Saturday Night Live.[14] \\"The Contest\\" is also based on David's experiences. \\"The Smelly Car\\" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car. \\"The Strike\\" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holidayFestivus.[15] Other stories take on a variety of turns. \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" consists of George, Jerry and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode.[16] \\"The Boyfriend\\", revolving around Keith Hernandez, extends through 2 episodes. \\"The Betrayal\\" is famous for using reverse chronology, and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play, Betrayal.[17] Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features \\"Notes About Nothing\\", \\"Inside Look\\", and \\"Audio Commentary\\". In \\"The Maestro\\", Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald's coffee case.[18] \\"The Outing\\" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality.[19]\\r\\nThe series was often described as \\"a show about nothing\\".[1][20] However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated \\"the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that.\\"[21]\\r\\nSeinfeld broke several conventions of mainstream television. The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality. [22] An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes revolve around the characters' involvement in the lives of others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the \\"no hugging, no learning\\" rule.[22] Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even Susan's death elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show.[23]\\r\\nThe characters are \\"thirty-something singles with vague identities, no roots, and conscious indifference to morals\\".[24] Usual conventions, like isolating the characters from the actors playing them and separating the characters' world from that of the actors and audience, were broken. One such example is the story arc where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named Jerry. The show within a show, Jerry, was much like Seinfeld in that it was \\"about nothing\\" and Seinfeld played himself. The fictional Jerry was launched in the season four finale, but unlike Seinfeld, it wasn't picked up as a series. Jerry is one of many examples of metafiction in the show. There are no fewer than twenty-two fictional movies featured, like Rochelle, Rochelle.[25] Because of these several elements, Seinfeld became the first TV series since Monty Python's Flying Circus to be widely described as postmodern.[26]\\r\\nMany terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture.[27][28] Notable catchphrases and terms include:\\r\\nThe lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as Seinlanguage, the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor.[26]\\r\\nA signature of Seinfeld is its theme music. Composed by Jonathan Wolff, it consists of distinct solo sampled bass synthesizer riffs (played on a Korg M1 synthesizer)[29] which open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by beatboxing.[30] The bass synthesizer music eventually replaced the original music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\". The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.\\r\\nIn \\"The Note\\", the first episode of season three, the bumper music featured a scatting female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like \\"easy to beat\\". Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements.[31] In the commentary of \\"The Note\\", Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time.[32]\\r\\nIn the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be re-styled in different ways depending on the episode. For instance, in \\"The Betrayal\\", part of which takes place in India, the theme is heard played on a sitar.\\r\\nSeinfeld stood out from family and group sitcoms of its time. None of the principal characters are related by family or work connections but remain distinctively close friends throughout the series.\\r\\nMany characters were based primarily on Seinfeld's and David's real-life acquaintances. Two prominent recurring characters were based on well-known people: Jacopo Peterman of the J. Peterman catalog (based on John Peterman),[36] and George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees.[37] Many characters were introduced as new writers got involved with Seinfeld. Other characters based on real people include the Soup Nazi[38] and Jackie Chiles based on Johnnie Cochran.[39]\\r\\nSeinfeld follows its own structure: story thread is presented at the beginning of every episode, which involves the characters starting in their own situations. Rapid scene-shifts between plot lines bring the stories together. Even though it does not follow a pattern as other sitcoms, the characters' stories variously intertwine in each episode. Despite the separate plot strands, the narratives reveal the creators' \\"consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy\\" among the small cast of characters.[40]\\r\\nThe show maintains a strong sense of continuitycharacters and plots from past episodes are often referenced or expanded on. Occasionally, story arcs span multiple episodes and even entire seasons, the most memorable being season four, which revolved around the pilot pitch to NBC by Jerry and George. Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in \\"The Stake Out\\" and he ends the relationship when things do not work out in \\"The Stock Tip\\". Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the \\"Peterman catalog\\". Larry David, the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. Curb Your EnthusiasmDavid's later comedy seriesexpanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.\\r\\nA major difference between Seinfeld and sitcoms which preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's producers was: \\"No hugging, no learning\\".[41] Entertainment Weekly's TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as \\"a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings\\".[42] This leads to very few happy endings, except at somebody else's expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters getting a justly deserved comeuppance.\\r\\nThe show premiered as The Seinfeld Chronicles on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up. Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next 4 episodes were filmed.[43][44] These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of Cheers on Thursdays at 9:30?p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30?p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called FM. The series was renamed Seinfeld after the failure of short-lived 1990 ABC series The Marshall Chronicles.[45] After airing in the summer of 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes. Larry David believed that he and Jerry Seinfeld had no more stories to tell, and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes.[44] Season two was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the (Persian) Gulf War. It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30?p.m. and eventually flipped with veteran series Night Court to 9:00.[46]\\r\\nTV critics championed Seinfeld in its early seasons, even as it was slow to cultivate a substantial audience. For the first three seasons, Jerry's stand-up comedy act would bookend an episode, even functioning as cut scenes during the show. A few episodes set a benchmark for later seasons. \\"The Deal\\" establishes Jerry and Elaine's relationship by setting rules about sleeping together and remaining friends.[47] \\"The Parking Garage\\" was the first episode shot with no audience for the episode and, after \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", with not showing Jerry's apartment.[48] \\"The Keys\\" contains a crossover to CBS show Murphy Brown, marking the first such cooperation between rival networks.[49] \\"The Busboy\\" introduces George, Kramer and Elaine as having their own storylines for the first time. Although Castle Rock Entertainment's Glenn Padnick thought Jerry Seinfeld was too generous, showcasing his co-stars' comedic talent became a trademark throughout the series.[50]\\r\\nLarry Charles wrote an episode for season two, \\"The Bet\\", in which Elaine buys a gun from Kramer's friend. This episode wasn't filmed because the content was deemed unacceptable, and was replaced by the episode \\"The Phone Message\\".[51] \\"The Stranded\\", aired in season three, was intended for season two. In the beginning of this episode, Jerry clears up the continuity error over George's real estate job.[52]\\r\\nSeason four marked the sitcom's entry into the Nielsen ratings Top 30, coinciding with several popular episodes, such as \\"The Bubble Boy\\" in which George and the bubble boy argue over Trivial Pursuit,[53] and \\"The Junior Mint\\" in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room.[54] This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, Jerry. Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of Seinfeld episodes was cut.\\r\\nMuch publicity followed the controversial episode, \\"The Contest\\", an Emmy Award-winning episode written by co-creator Larry David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word \\"masturbation\\" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.[55] Midway through that season, Seinfeld was moved from its original 9:00?p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30?p.m. on Thursdays, following Cheers again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom Home Improvement on ABC had aired at the same time and Improvement kept beating Seinfeld in the ratings. NBC moved the series after Ted Danson announced the end of Cheers and Seinfeld quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00?p.m. Cheers reruns that spring.[56] The show won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993, beating out its family-oriented, time-slot competitor Home Improvement, which was only in its second season on fellow network ABC.\\r\\nSeason five was an even bigger ratings-hit, consisting of popular episodes, such as \\"The Puffy Shirt\\" in which Jerry feels embarrassed wearing the \\"pirate\\" shirt on The Today Show,[57] \\"The Non-Fat Yogurt\\" featuring Rudy Giuliani, the Republican then-mayor-elect of New York,[58] and \\"The Opposite\\" in which George, doing the opposite of what his instincts tell him he should do, lands in the \\"New York Yankees\\" and Elaine leaves \\"Pendant Publishing\\" because of a comedy of errors that lead to its demise. Another story arc has George returning to live with his parents. In the midst of the story arc, Kramer creates and promotes his coffee table book.[59] The show was again nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to the Cheers spin-off Frasier, then in its first season. Seinfeld was nominated for the same award every year for its entire run but always lost to Frasier, which went on to win a record thirty-nine Emmy Awards.\\r\\nWith Season six, Andy Ackerman replaced Tom Cherones as director of the show. The series remained well-regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as \\"The Beard\\" in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched Melrose Place,[60] \\"The Switch\\" in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo,[61] and \\"The Understudy\\" in which Elaine meets J. Peterman for the first time.[62] Story arcs used in this season were Elaine working as a personal assistant to her eccentric boss Justin Pitt and George's parents' temporary separation. This was the first season win which Seinfeld reached No. 1 in the Nielsen Ratings. The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined with the end stand-up segment no longer appearing, as the storylines for all four characters grew denser.\\r\\nIn season seven, a story arc involved George getting engaged to his ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross, after the pilot Jerry proved unsuccessful. In it, George spends most of the season regretting and trying to get out of the engagement. Along with the regular half-hour episodes, two notable one-hour episodes were \\"The Cadillac\\" in which George plans to date award-winning actor Marisa Tomei[63] and \\"The Bottle Deposit\\" with Elaine and Sue Ellen participating in a bidding war to buy JFK's golf clubs in an auction.[64]\\r\\nThe show's ratings were still going strong in its final two seasons. Larry David left at the end of season seven, although he continued to voice Steinbrenner, so Seinfeld assumed David's duties as showrunner, and, under the direction of a new writing staff, Seinfeld became a faster-paced show. The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedyJerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilitiesand storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor. For example, in \\"The Bizarro Jerry\\", Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famed \\"man hands\\".[65] Some notable episodes from season eight include \\"The Little Kicks\\" showing Elaine's horrible dancing,[66] and \\"The Chicken Roaster\\" which portrays the Kenny Rogers Roasters chicken restaurant which opened during that time.[67] A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to Burma in \\"The Foundation\\"[68] until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in \\"The Money\\",[69] followed by Elaine writing Peterman's biography in \\"The Van Buren Boys\\",[70] which leads to Kramer's parody of Kenny Kramer's Reality Tour seen in \\"The Muffin Tops\\".[71]\\r\\nThe final season included episodes like \\"The Merv Griffin Show\\" in which Kramer converts his apartment into a talk-show studio and plays the character of talk-show host,[72] \\"The Betrayal\\" that presents in reverse chronological order what happened to Sue Ellen's wedding in India, and \\"The Frogger\\" in which George pushes a Frogger machine across the street.[73] The last season included a story arc in which Elaine has an on/off relationship with Puddy. Despite the enormous popularity and willingness of the cast to return for a tenth season, Seinfeld decided to end the show after season nine, believing he would thereby be able to ensure the show would maintain its quality and go out on top.[74] NBC offered him over $100 million for a tenth season, but Seinfeld declined the offer.[75][citation needed]\\r\\nA major controversy caused in this final season was the accidental burning of a Puerto Rican flag by Kramer in \\"The Puerto Rican Day\\". This scene caused a furor among Puerto Ricans, and as a result, NBC showed this episode only once. However, Jerry Seinfeld defused the protestors by not letting this episode continue in syndication, as revealed in \\"Inside Look\\" on DVD.[76]\\r\\nAfter nine years on the air, NBC and Jerry Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998. The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including the New York Times. Jerry Seinfeld was featured on the cover of Time magazine's first issue of 1998.[77] The series ended with a seventy-five-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in syndication, in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998. Before the finale, a forty-five-minute retrospective clip show, \\"The Chronicle\\", was aired. The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.\\r\\nIt was the first episode since the finale of season seven, \\"The Invitations\\", to feature opening and closing stand-up comedy acts by Jerry Seinfeld. The finale was filmed before an audience of NBC executives and friends of the show. The press and public were shut out of the taping in order to keep its plot secret; those who attended the shoot of the final episode were required to sign written \\"vows of silence\\".[78] The secrecy only seemed to increase speculation about how the series would end. The producers of the show tweaked the media about the hype, spreading a false rumor about Newman ending up in the hospital and Jerry and Elaine sitting in a chapel, presumably to marry.[79]\\r\\nThe final episode enjoyed a historic[80] audience, estimated at 76.3 million viewers (58% of all viewers that night) making it the fourth most watched regular series finale in U.S. TV history, behind M*A*S*H, Cheers and The Fugitive. However, the finale received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the show. The finale poked fun at the many rumors that were circulating, seeming to move into multiple supposed plots before settling on its true storylinea lengthy trial where the gang is prosecuted for violating a \\"Good Samaritan law\\" and sentenced to prison terms.\\r\\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Jerry Seinfeld's earnings from the show in 1998 came to US$267 million, including syndication earnings.[81] He refused NBC's offer of $5 million per episode, or over $100 million total, to continue the show into a tenth season. The offer NBC made to Seinfeld was over three times higher per episode than anyone on TV had ever been offered before.[82] Seinfeld told the network that he was not married and had no children, and wished to focus on his personal life.[83][44] As reported in July 2007, he was the second-highest earner in the TV industry, earning at the time $60 million a year.[84] The show became the first TV series to command over $1 million a minute for advertisingÿa mark previously attained only by the Super Bowl.[85]\\r\\nAccording to Barry Meyer, chairman of Warner Bros. Entertainment, Seinfeld made $2.7 billion through June 2010.[86] As of February 2017[update] the show has made an estimated $4.06 billion in syndication. Steve Bannon, who invested in the show, later said \\"We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication. We were wrong by a factor of five\\".[87]\\r\\nSeinfeld began as a twenty-three-minute pilot titled The Seinfeld Chronicles. Created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt and the effort by men to properly interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.[88]\\r\\nThe pilot was filmed at Stage 8 of Desilu Cahuenga studios, the same studio where The Dick Van Dyke Show was filmed (this was seen by the crew as a good omen),[89] and was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood.[90] The pilot was first screened to a group of two dozen NBC executives in Burbank, California in early 1989. It didn't yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like The Cosby Show and The Golden Girls. Brandon Tartikoff, was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as \\"Too New York, too Jewish\\". Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as \\"Weak\\", which Littlefield called \\"a dagger to the heart\\".[88] Comments included, \\"You can't get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat\\"; \\"Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character\\"; \\"Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast\\"; and \\"Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?\\"[90] Seinfeld and David didn't see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, \\"We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment.\\"[88]\\r\\nWhen NBC announced its 1989ÿ90 primetime schedule in May 1989, The Seinfeld Chronicles was not included, but supporters of the show didn't give up on it. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama Jake and the Fatman,[88] receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19, meaning that the pilot was watched by 10.9% of American households, and that 19% of all TVs in use at the time were tuned into it.[90] The ratings didn't exhibit regional skew that Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Despite the poor test results, Ludwin cancelled one of the Bob Hope specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order six more episodes of The Seinfeld Chronicles, which formed the rest of the show's first season,[88][91] a move without which Chicago Tribune columnist Phil Rosenthal later stated there would be no Seinfeld.[92] Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history[90]), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order.[88] The show was renamed Seinfeld, but it wouldn't return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it'd be another three years before it became a Top 5 ratings success. Preston Beckman, who was in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, \\"The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits.\\"\\r\\nWhen it was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26. These ratings were high enough to secure a second season.[90] NBC research showed that the show was popular with young male adults, a demographic sought after by advertisers. This gave NBC an incentive to keep broadcasting the show.[93] One DVD reviewer, Britt Gillette, wrote that \\"this initial episode exhibits the flashes of brilliance that made Seinfeld a cultural phenomenon.\\"[94]\\r\\nThere are two high-definition versions of Seinfeld. The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases.[95] Syndicated broadcast stations and the cable network TBS began airing the syndicated version of Seinfeld in HD. Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame, while restoring previously cropped images on the sides, from the 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 frame.[96]\\r\\nElizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of Seinfeld with recourse to the incongruity theory of humor: \\"The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation. For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, comprised of the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic.\\"[97] Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on \\"The Marine Biologist\\", where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on \\"The Red Dot\\", where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine's expense by giving her a marked-down cashmere sweater.\\r\\nNod Miller, of the University of East London, has discussed the self-referential qualities of the show:\\r\\nSeinfeld is suffused with postmodern themes. To begin with, the boundary between reality and fiction is frequently blurred: this is illustrated in the central device of having Jerry Seinfeld play the character Jerry Seinfeld. In the show's fourth season, several episodes revolved around the narrative of Jerry and George (whose character is co-creator Larry David's alter ego) pitching 'a show about nothing' based on the everyday life of a stand-up comedian to NBC. The reaction of the fictional NBC executives, by all accounts, mirrored the initial responses of those who eventually commissioned Seinfeld. The fourth season ends with 'The Pilot', an episode focusing on the casting, taping and screening of the show-within-the-show, Jerry. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.[98]\\r\\nWilliam Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing. Some entries include \\"The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem\\", \\"George's Failed Zest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis\\", \\"Elaine's Moral Character\\", \\"Kramer the 'Seducer'\\", \\"Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao\\", \\"Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre\\", \\"Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me\\", and \\"Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law\\".[99]\\r\\nSeinfeld has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s. It was awarded the Emmy for \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" in 1993, Golden Globe Award for \\"Best TV-Series (Comedy)\\" in 1994 and Screen Actors Guild Award for \\"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\\" in 1995, 1997 and 1998.[113][114][115][116] Apart from these, the show was also nominated for an Emmy award from 1992 to 1998 for \\"Outstanding Comedy series\\", Golden Globe award from 1994 to 1998 for \\"Best TV-Series (Comedy)\\", and Screen Actors Guild Award for \\"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\\" from 1995 to 1998.[117]\\r\\nTV Guide named it the greatest TV show of all time in 2002.[118] and in 2013, they ranked it as the second greatest TV show.[5]\\r\\nA recurring feature of Seinfeld was its inclusion of specific products, especially candy, as plot points. These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., Junior Mints, Twix, Jujyfruits, bite size Three Musketeers, Snickers, Nestl Chunky, Oh Henry!, Drake's Coffee Cake and PEZ), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. Oh Henry! bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., Chuckles, Clark Bar, Twinkies). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.\\r\\nThe show's creators claim that they weren't engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. \\"I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie\\", explained Seinfeld writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in the Hollywood Reporter. \\"At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'\\"[119]\\r\\nMany advertisers capitalized on the popularity of Seinfeld. American Express created a webisode where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated Superman (voiced by Patrick Warburton, who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the Today Sponge created the \\"Spongeworthy\\" game, on their website, inspired by \\"The Sponge\\". An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a Chrysler commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with Lee Iacocca plays on his George's relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for Vodafone which ran in Australia where he dressed and acted exactly like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls.\\r\\nIn addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a Scotch brand called \\"Hennigan's\\" (a portmanteau of \\"Hennessy\\" and \\"Brannigans\\") and a canned meat product called \\"Beef-a-reeno\\" (a parody of \\"Beef-a-roni\\").\\r\\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment released all nine seasons of Seinfeld on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 between 2004 and 2007.[120] On November 6, 2007, Seinfeld: The Complete Series was released on DVD. The complete series set box set includes a 2007 \\"roundtable\\" reunion of the four main cast members and Larry David; only highlights of this were also included in the Season 9 set.\\r\\nOn April 29, 2015, it was officially announced, during Hulu's upfronts presentation in New York, that all nine seasons of Seinfeld would be available for online streaming, via the video service, starting in June 2015.[137][138] The news was first reported by Variety and Deadline, citing the deal at around $130 million to $180 million.[139] On May 20, 2015, Hulu announced that every episode would be available, on June 24, 2015.[140]\\r\\nOn November 8, 2016, the Australian streaming service Stan. announced via Twitter that later in the week all episodes would be available to stream for the first time in Australia.[141] All episodes were available from November 11, 2016 with the remastered versions of all episodes on the service featuring HD and Widescreen enhancements.[142] The widescreen offered was cropped from the original 4:3 format negatives, thus resulting in better visual quality than the previously available DVD version, however the top and bottom portions of the frame were cut out to achieve the widescreen aspect ratio.\\r\\nOn the November 1, 2007, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of shooting one last scene, after they leave jail. He mentioned that he was too busy to do it at the time, but didn't announce what the scene would entail, as its production isn't a certainty.[143]\\r\\nIn commentary from the final season DVD, Seinfeld outlines that he and Jason Alexander spoke about this scene being in Monk's Cafe, with George saying \\"That was brutal\\" in reference to the foursome's stint in prison.[144]\\r\\nLouis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards have all tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Despite acclaim and even respectable ratings, almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season. This gave rise to the term Seinfeld curse: the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's Seinfeld popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the Seinfeld curse are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Watching Ellie, Jason Alexander's Bob Patterson and Listen Up!, and Michael Richards' The Michael Richards Show. Larry David said of the curse, \\"It's so completely idiotic. It's very hard to have a successful sitcom.\\"[145]\\r\\nThis phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of Larry David's HBO program Curb Your Enthusiasm. However, the Emmy award-winning success of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the CBS sitcom The New Adventures of Old Christine led many to believe that she had broken the curse.[146] In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, \\"I'm not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!\\"[147] The show was on the air for five seasons starting March 13, 2006 before its cancellation on May 18, 2010; the series produced enough episodes to air in reruns in syndication for several years, something the other shows didn't achieve.[148] The Saturday Night Live episode guest-hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Louis-Dreyfus went on to win six further Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmys for her acclaimed performance as Vice President Selina Meyer in HBO's comedy series Veep.[149]\\r\\nEarly in March 2009, it was announced that the Seinfeld cast would reunite for season seven of Curb Your Enthusiasm.[150] The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing their real life selves. The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a Seinfeld reunion show as a ploy to get his ex-wife, Cheryl, back. Along with the four main characters, some Seinfeld supporting actors like Wayne Knight, Estelle Harris and Steve Hytner appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show. Though much dialogue in Curb Your Enthusiasm is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the Seinfeld special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by Seinfeld regular Andy Ackerman, making this the first time since Seinfeld went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.\\r\\nJerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Wayne Knight, playing their respective Seinfeld characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of the 2014 Super Bowl on February 2.[151] FOX came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York that year.[151][152] An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee titled \\"The Over-Cheer\\".[151] Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, who produces the series, did not pay for it.[151] Seinfeld has indicated that he thinks the webisode will probably be the last cast reunion, saying, \\"I have a feeling you've seen the final coda on that very unique experience.\\"[153]","input":"When did the first episode of seinfeld air?"},{"output":"three groups of contiguous languages: Northern, Pacific Coast and Southern (or Apachean)","context":"Athabaskan or Athabascan (also Dene, Athapascan, Athapaskan) is a large family of indigenous languages of North America, located in western North America in three groups of contiguous languages: Northern, Pacific Coast and Southern (or Apachean). Kari and Potter 2010:10 place the total territory of the 53 Athabaskan languages at 1,563,000?mi2 or 4,022,000?km2.\\r\\nChipewyan is spoken over the largest area of any North American native language, while Navajo is spoken by the largest number of people of any native language north of Mexico.\\r\\nAlthough the term Athabaskan is prevalent in linguistics and anthropology, there is an increasing trend among scholars to use the terms Den and Den languages, which is how their native speakers identify it. They are applying these terms to the entire language family. For example, following a motion by attendees in 2012, the annual Athabaskan Languages Conference changed its name to the Den Languages Conference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Athabaskan is an anglicized version of a Cree language name for Lake Athabasca (Cree: AѴapaskaw [where] there are reeds one after another) in Canada. Cree is one of the Algonquian languages.[2] The name was assigned by Albert Gallatin in his 1836 (written 1826) classification of the languages of North America. He acknowledged that it was his choice to use this name for the language family and associated peoples, writing:\\r\\nI have designated them by the arbitrary denomination of Athabascas, which derived from the original name of the lake.\\r\\nThe four spellingsAthabaskan, Athabascan, Athapaskan, and Athapascan쨕are in approximately equal use. Particular communities may prefer one spelling over another (Krauss 1987). For example, the Tanana Chiefs Conference and Alaska Native Language Center prefer the spelling Athabascan.[3] Ethnologue uses Athapaskan in naming the language family and individual languages.[4]\\r\\nLinguists conventionally divide the Athabaskan family into three groups, based on geographic distribution:\\r\\nThe 32 Northern Athabaskan languages are spoken throughout the interior of Alaska and the interior of northwestern Canada in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, as well as in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Several Athabaskan languages are official languages in the Northwest Territories, including Chipewyan (D?nes???n), Dogrib or T???ch? Yat?, Gwichin (Kutchin, Loucheux), and Slavey.\\r\\nThe seven or more Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. These include Applegate, Galice, several Rogue River area languages, Upper Coquille, Tolowa, and Upper Umpqua in Oregon; Eel River, Hupa, MattoleÿBear River, and Tolowa in northern California; and possibly Kwalhioqua-Clatskanie in Washington.\\r\\nThe seven Southern Athabaskan languages are isolated by considerable distance from both the Pacific Coast languages and the Northern languages. Reflecting an ancient migration of peoples, they are spoken by Native Americans in the American Southwest and the northwestern part of Mexico. This group comprises the six Southern Athabaskan languages and Navajo.\\r\\nAs a crude approximation, the differences between Athabaskan languages may be compared to differences between Indo-European languages. Thus, Koyukon and Denaina are about as different as French and Spanish, while Koyukon and Gwichin are as different as English and Italian.[5]\\r\\nThe following list gives the Athabaskan languages organized by their geographic location in various North American states and provinces (including some languages that are now extinct). Speakers of several languages, such as Navajo and Gwichin, span the boundaries between different states and provinces. These languages are repeated by location in this list. For alternative names for the languages, see the classifications given later in this article.\\r\\nEyak and Athabaskan together form a genealogical linguistic grouping called AthabaskanÿEyak (AE) ÿ well demonstrated through consistent sound correspondences, extensive shared vocabulary, and cross-linguistically unique homologies in both verb and noun morphology.\\r\\nTlingit is distantly related to the AthabaskanÿEyak group to form the Na-Dene family, also known as AthabaskanÿEyakÿTlingit (AET). With Jeff Leer's 2010 advances, the reconstructions of Na-Dene (or AthabascanÿEyakÿTlingit) consonants, this latter grouping is considered by Alaskan linguists to be a well-demonstrated family. Because both Tlingit and Eyak are fairly remote from the Athabaskan languages in terms of their sound systems, comparison is usually done between them and the reconstructed Proto-Athabaskan language. This resembles both Tlingit and Eyak much more than most of the daughter languages in the Athabaskan family.\\r\\nAlthough Ethnologue still gives the Athabaskan family as a relative of Haida in their definition of the Na-Dene family, linguists who work actively on Athabaskan languages discount this position. The Alaska Native Language Center, for example, takes the position that recent improved data on Haida have served to conclusively disprove the Haida-inclusion hypothesis. Haida has been determined to be unrelated to Athabaskan languages.\\r\\nA symposium in Alaska in February 2008 included papers on the Yeniseian and Na-Den families. Edward Vajda of Western Washington University summarized ten years of research, based on verbal morphology and reconstructions of the proto-languages, indicating that these languages might be related. [7]\\r\\nThe internal structure of the Athabaskan language family is complex, and its exact shape is still a hotly debated issue among experts. The conventional three-way split into Northern, Pacific Coast, and Southern is essentially based on geography and the physical distribution of Athabaskan peoples rather than sound linguistic comparisons. Despite this inadequacy, current comparative Athabaskan literature demonstrates that most Athabaskanists still use the three-way geographic grouping rather than any of the proposed linguistic groupings given below, because none of them has been widely accepted. This situation will presumably change as both documentation and analysis of the languages improves.\\r\\nBesides the traditional geographic grouping described previously, there are a few comparatively based subgroupings of the Athabaskan languages. Below the two most current viewpoints are presented.\\r\\nThe following is an outline of the classification according to Keren Rice, based on those published in Goddard (1996) and Mithun (1999). It represents what is generously called the RiceÿGoddardÿMithun classification (Tuttle & Hargus 2004:73), although it is almost entirely due to Keren Rice.\\r\\nBranches 1ÿ7 are the Northern Athabaskan (areal) grouping. KwalhioquaÿClatskanai (#7) was normally placed inside the Pacific Coast grouping, but a recent consideration by Krauss (2005) does not find it very similar to these languages.\\r\\nA different classification by Jeff Leer is the following, usually called the Leer classification (Tuttle & Hargus 2004:72ÿ74):\\r\\nNeither subgrouping has found any significant support among other Athabaskanists. Details of the Athabaskan family tree should be regarded as tentative. As Tuttle and Hargus put it, we do not consider the points of difference between the two models ... to be decisively settled and in fact expect them to be debated for some time to come. (Tuttle & Hargus 2004:74)\\r\\nThe Northern group is particularly problematic in its internal organization. Due to the failure of the usual criteria of shared innovation and systematic phonetic correspondences to provide well-defined subgroupings, the Athabaskan family ÿ especially the Northern group ÿ has been called a cohesive complex by Michael Krauss (1973, 1982). Therefore, the Stammbaumtheorie or family tree model of genetic classification may be inappropriate. The languages of the Southern branch are much more homogeneous and are the only clearly genealogical subgrouping.\\r\\nDebate continues as to whether the Pacific Coast languages form a valid genealogical grouping, or whether this group may instead have internal branches that are tied to different subgroups in Northern Athabaskan. The position of KwalhioquaÿClatskanai is also debated, since it may fall in either the Pacific Coast group ÿ if that exists ÿ or into the Northern group. The records of Nicola are so poor ÿ Krauss describes them as too few and too wretched (Krauss 2005) ÿ that it is difficult to make any reliable conclusions about it. Nicola may be intermediate between KwalhioquaÿTlatskanai and Chilcotin.\\r\\nSimilarly to Nicola, there is very limited documentation on Tsetsaut. Consequently, it is difficult to place it in the family with much certainty. Athabaskanists have concluded that it is a Northern Athabaskan language consistent with its geographical occurrence, and that it might have some relation to its distant neighbor Tahltan. Tsetsaut, however, shares its primary hydronymic suffix (river, stream) with Sekani, Beaver, and Tsuutina ÿ PA *-?ah ÿ rather than with that of Tahltan, Tagish, Kaska, and North and South Tutchone ÿ PA *-tu? (Kari 1996; Kari, Fall, & Pete 2003:39). The ambiguity surrounding Tsetsaut is why it is placed in its own subgroup in the RiceÿGoddardÿMithun classification.\\r\\nFor detailed lists including languages, dialects, and subdialects, see the respective articles on the three major groups: Northern Athabaskan, Pacific Coast Athabaskan, Southern Athabaskan. For the remainder of this article, the conventional three-way geographic grouping will be followed except as noted.\\r\\nThe Northern Athabaskan languages are the largest group in the Athabaskan family, although this group varies internally about as much as do languages in the entire family. The urheimat of the Athabaskan family is most likely in the Tanana Valley of east-central Alaska. There are many homologies between Proto-Athabaskan vocabulary and patterns reflected in archaeological sites such as Upward Sun, Swan Point and Broken Mammoth (Kari 2010). The Northern Athabaskan group also contains the most linguistically conservative languages, particularly Koyukon, Ahtna, Denaina, and Dakelh/Carrier (Leer 2008).\\r\\nVery little is known about Tsetsaut, and for this reason it is routinely placed in its own tentative subgroup.\\r\\nThe Nicola language is so poorly attested that it is impossible to determine its position within the family. It has been proposed by some to be an isolated branch of Chilcotin.\\r\\nThe KwalhioquaÿClatskanie language is debatably part of the Pacific Coast subgroup, but has marginally more in common with the Northern Athabaskan languages than it does with the Pacific Coast languages (Leer 2005). It thus forms a notional sort of bridge between the Northern Athabaskan languages and the Pacific Coast languages, along with Nicola (Krauss 1979/2004).\\r\\nThe reconstruction of Proto-Athabaskan phonology is still under active debate. This section attempts to summarize the less controversial parts of the Proto-Athabaskan sound system.\\r\\nAs with many linguists working on Native American languages, Athabaskanists tend to use an Americanist phonetic notation system rather than IPA. Although some Athabaskanists prefer IPA symbols today, the weight of tradition is particularly heavy in historical and comparative linguistics, hence the Americanist symbols are still in common use for descriptions of Proto-Athabaskan and in comparisons between members of the family. In the tables in this section, the proto-phonemes are given in their conventional Athabaskanist forms with IPA equivalents following in square brackets.\\r\\nSince transcription practices in Americanist phonetic notation are not formally standardized, there are different symbols in use for the same sounds, a proliferation partly due to changes in typefaces and computing technology. In the following tables, the older symbols are given first with newer symbols following. Not all linguists adopt the newer symbols at once, although there are obvious trends, such as the adoption of belted ? instead of barred ?, and the use of digraphs for affricates which is standard today for the laterals but not fully adopted for the dorsals. In particular, the symbols c, , and ? are rare in most publications today. The use of the combining comma above as in c? has also been completely abandoned in the last few decades in favor of the modifier letter apostrophe as in c?. Republication of older materials may preserve older symbols for accuracy, although they are no longer used, e.g. Krauss 2005, which was previously an unpublished manuscript dating from 1979.\\r\\nIt is crucial to recognize that the symbols conventionally used to represent voiced stops and affricates are actually used in the Athabaskan literature to represent unaspirated stops and affricates in contrast to the aspirated ones. This convention is also found in all Athabaskan orthographies since true voiced stops and affricates are rare in the family, and unknown in the proto-language.\\r\\nThe traditional reconstruction of the Proto-Athabaskan sound system consists of 45 consonants (Cook 1981; Krauss & Golla 1981; Krauss & Leer 1981; Cook & Rice 1989), as detailed in the following table.\\r\\nA peculiar proto-phoneme in Proto-Athabaskan is the sound that Krauss (1976b) represents as *$, and which Leer (2005:284) has represented as *?? though lately he has since returned to *$ (e.g. Leer 2008). This is the phoneme found in Proto-Athabaskan, Proto-AthabaskanÿEyak, and Proto-Na-Dene that occurs in various reflexes of the first person singular pronoun. In Athabaskan languages, it usually has a reflex of /?/, the alveolar fricative, but in Eyak it appears as /x/ and in Tlingit as //. Peculiarly, in Kwalhioqua-Tlatskanai, it seems to have been /x/ in at least some forms of the first-person-subject verb prefix (Krauss 1976b). It does not correspond well with other fricatives, a situation that led Krauss to considering it as unique. This proto-phoneme is not given in the table above, but is always assumed to be somehow a part of the Proto-Athabaskan inventory.\\r\\nA newer reconstruction by Leer (2005:284) constitutes a significant reorganization of the system. Velars are reinterpreted as palatals, labialized postalveolar affricates are reinterpreted as retroflex consonants, and other labialized consonants are removed. In addition, the clear assertion is made that stops and affricates are phonologically the same class, although they may be articulated somewhat differently. Leer also adopted the argument advanced by Keren Rice (1997) that there was no need to distinguish between *y and *??. The resulting system is somewhat simpler than the traditional one, with 8 fewer phonemes.\\r\\nThe asymmetric lack of retroflex fricatives in the Proto-Athabaskan inventory appears as a surprising gap, but Leer argued against them being distinguished from *? and *?: \\"In my reconstruction, PA lacked distinctively reflexed *?? and *?? as opposed to plain *? and *?\\". Although Leer (2005) did not include *? and *h in his list of reconstructed consonants, those two proto-phonemes nevertheless appear in a variety of reconstructions in the same article and hence it can be assumed that they are indeed part of his proto-phoneme inventory.\\r\\nLeer (2005:284) also offered a vowel system consisting of four long or full vowels and three short or reduced vowels which are more centralized.\\r\\nThe following table is adapted from Leer 2005 (p.?286) and shows the vowel correspondences between Proto-Athabaskan and the better documented Athabaskan languages.\\r\\nThe reconstruction of tone is an issue of major importance in Athabaskan language studies, as well as for the wider historical linguistics field. The possibility of a reconstructable tone system was first proposed by Edward Sapir, although it took around a half-century for his ideas to be realized into a coherent system. Michael Krausss unpublished manuscript on Athabaskan tone (1979) circulated for decades before being published (2005), and has become the basis for all discussion of Athabaskan tonology. Krauss gives a detailed history of the work on Athabaskan tonology which is briefly summarized here.\\r\\nThe early work on Athabaskan languages ignored the existence of phonemic tone. Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice was the first linguist to describe tone for an Athabaskan language, specifically for Carrier, in 1891. Sapirs first fieldwork on Athabaskan languages was with Chasta Costa and Kato, both Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages that lack tone. He encountered tone in Tlingit in 1914 when working with Louis Shotridge, a student and consultant of Franz Boas, with whom Sapir described the minimal pair /q?t/ crippled and /qa?t/ sockeye salmon. He then encountered tone in Tsuutina (Sarcee) and gradually became convinced that Proto-Athabaskan must be reconstructed as a tonal language, although he was concerned by apparently contradictory findings in Gwichin, Deg Hitan, and Navajo. His student Fang-Kuei Li, whom Sapir described as a very able Chinaman, had the benefit of speaking Mandarin Chinese and hence being well aware of tone. Sapir and Fang-Kuei Li investigated tone in several other Athabaskan languages, including Mattole, Wailaki, Hupa, D?ne S??in (Chipewyan), and Hare. The problem that disturbed Sapir and others was that tone in Athabaskan languages does correspond, but in an unexpected and difficult to explain way.\\r\\nIt can be seen in the table above that the languages differ in how their tones correspond: the first three have low tone where the next three have high tone, and vice versa, with the last three lacking tone entirely. This issue puzzled linguists for some time. Both Li and Harry Hoijer both harbored suspicions that Proto-Athabaskan lacked tone entirely, but it took until 1964 when Michael Krauss published a paper in the International Journal of American Linguistics where he argued that Proto-Athabaskan instead had glottalization contrasts which developed independently into tones in the daughter languages or in some cases were lost. This argument was strengthened by data from Eyak which had a system of glottal modifications on vowels that corresponded well to Athabaskan tones, and furthermore by Jeff Leers discovery of the Tongass dialect of Tlingit, which had a system closely corresponding that of Eyak.\\r\\nThe oppositions in tonal distribution are explained as an ahistorical division in Athabaskan languages whereby each language becomes either high-marked, low-marked, or unmarked for tone based on the Proto-Athabaskan reconstruction. The following table adapted from Rice & Hargus (2005:9) shows how the syllable codas of Proto-Athabaskan (PA) and the internal reconstruction of Pre-Proto-Athabaskan (PPA) correspond with those of the high-marked and low-marked languages.\\r\\nIn the above table, the symbol v represents a monomoraic reduced vowel, the VV represents a bimoraic full vowel, and the V a monomoraic full vowel in a syllable nucleus whose second mora is .[8] The R represents a sonorant, the S a fricative, the T a stop or affricate, and the  a glottalization of the preceding segment. Note that nearly all languages that developed tone have also lost syllable-final ejectivity, retaining only the glottalized sonorants and bare glottal stops in that position. (Syllable initial ejective stops and affricates are of course retained.)\\r\\nBecause obvious similarities in morphology are prevalent throughout all of the languages in the Athabaskan family, Proto-Athabaskan rejoices in an extensive reconstructed proto-morphology. All Athabaskan languages are morphologically complex and are commonly described as polysynthetic, thus it comes as no surprise that the proto-language is also morphologically complex.\\r\\nKeren Rice (2000) offers a Pan-Athabaskan verb template that characterizes the complexity of verb morphology in the proto-language and the daughter languages.\\r\\nThe actual verb template of Proto-Athabaskan has not been reconstructed yet, as noted by Vajda (2010:38). Nonetheless, Rices generalization of the verb template based on various languages in the family is a reasonable approximation of what the structure of the Proto-Athabaskan verb might look like.\\r\\nRices is probably the newest attempt at a Pan-Athabaskan template, but it is not the only one. Kibrik (1995) and Hoijer (1971) also proposed templates which generalized across a number of Athabaskan languages. Hoijers proposal is missing several elements which were described in detail later, but Kibriks is not terribly different from Rices.\\r\\nKibrik only gives the zones rather than individual positions where the distinction matters. In addition, Kibrik did not give the domains and boundaries which have been added here for comparison.\\r\\nA major distinction between the Kibrik and Rice versions is in the terminology, with Kibriks Standard Average Athabaskan maintaining much of the traditional Athabaskanist terminology ÿ still widely used ÿ but Rice changing in favor of aspectual descriptions found in wider semantic and typological literature. The terminology in comparison:\\r\\nKari (1989) offers a rigorous foundation for the position class system that makes up the verb template in Athabaskan languages. He defines a few terms and resurrects others which have since become standard in Athabaskanist literature.\\r\\nKari (1989) and elsewhere uses + to indicate morpheme boundaries. This convention has been adopted by some Athabaskanists, but many others use the more common ÿ instead. Another innovation from Kari is the use of angle brackets to mark epenthetic segments, a convention which is not often used even by Kari himself.\\r\\nThe classifier is a verb prefix that occurs in all Athabaskan languages as well as the Tlingit and Eyak languages. It is, as Leer (1990:77) puts it, the hallmark of Na-Dene languages. The classifier is found in no other language family, although may be present in the Yeniseian family per Vajda (2010). It is an obligatory prefix such that verbs do not exist without the classifier. Its function varies little from language to language, essentially serving as an indicator of (middle) voice and valence for the verb.\\r\\nThe name classifier is confusing to non-Athabaskanists since it implies a classificatory function that is not obvious. Franz Boas first described it for Tlingit, saying it is fairly clear that the primary function of these elements is a classificatory one (Boas 1917:28), a not inaccurate statement given that it does enter into the classificatory verb system. Previously Edward Sapir had noted it in his seminal essay on the Na-Dene family, calling it a third modal element (Sapir 1915:540). He described it as indicating such notions as transitive, intransitive, and passive (id.), thus having voice and valency related functions. Once it was realized that the Tlingit and Athabaskan morphemes were functionally similar Boass name for the Tlingit form was extended to the Athabaskan family. Unfortunately the classifier has only the vague remains of classificatory function in most Athabaskan languages, so in this family the name is opaque.\\r\\nBecause of the confusion that occurs from the use of the term classifier, there have been a number of proposals for replacement terms. Andrej Kibrik (1993, 1996, 2001) has used the term transitivity indicator with the gloss abbreviation TI, Keren Rice (2000, 2009)[citation needed] has used voice/valence prefix abbreviated V/V, and for Tlingit Constance Naish and Gillian Story (1973:368ÿ378) used extensor. None of these alternatives has gained acceptance in the Athabaskan community, and Jeff Leer describes this situation:\\r\\nA better term would be something like valentizers, since their principal function is to indicate the valence of the verb [...] However, since the name classifier is one of the few grammatical labels sanctioned by common use among Athabaskanists, it is probably not worth the trouble to try to change it.\\r\\nJeff Leer (1990:93) offers an early reconstruction of the Proto-Athabaskan classifier. It is a portmanteau morpheme with two dimensions that are both phonological and functional. The one dimension is the series, which surfaces as the presence or absence of a lateral fricative. The other dimension is the D-effect, surfacing as the presence or absence of either vocalization or an alveolar stop.\\r\\nLeer (2008:22) gives a newer, more complex reconstruction, which takes into account some rare correspondences with the Eyak yi- prefix. This Eyak form corresponds to a Proto-Athabaskan *n??- that is mostly lost.","input":"How many athabaskan language groups exist in alaska?"},{"output":"Zoroastrians","context":"","input":"What do you call a follower of zoroastrianism?"},{"output":"sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning","context":"Mohenjo-daro (Sindhi: ???? ?? ????, Urdu: ???? ?? ?????, IPA: [mu??n? d?o? d???o?], Sindhi for Mound of the Dead Men;[2] English: /mo??h?n.d?o? ?d?.ro?/) is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built around 2500 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley civilization, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980.[3] The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMohenjo-daro, the modern name for the site, has been variously interpreted as \\"Mound of the Dead Men\\" in Sindhi, and as \\"Mound of Mohan\\" (where Mohan is Krishna).[2][5] The city's original name is unknown. Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma (\\"the city [-rma] of the cockerel [kukkuta]\\").[6] Cock-fighting may have had ritual and religious significance for the city, with domesticated chickens bred there for sacred purposes, rather than as a food source. Mohenjo-daro may also have been a point of diffusion for the eventual worldwide domestication of chickens.[7]\\r\\nMohenjo-daro is located west of the Indus River in Larkana District, Sindh, Pakistan, in a central position between the Indus River and the Ghaggar-Hakra River. It is sited on a Pleistocene ridge in the middle of the flood plain of the Indus River Valley, around 28 kilometres (17?mi) from the town of Larkana.[8] The ridge was prominent during the time of the Indus Valley Civilization, allowing the city to stand above the surrounding flood, but subsequent flooding has since buried most of the ridge in silt deposits. The Indus still flows east of the site, but the Ghaggar-Hakra riverbed on the western side is now dry.[9]\\r\\nMohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BCE.[10] It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization,[11] which developed around 3,000 BCE from the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian border, south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an outpost in Bactria, with major urban centers at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi. Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning.[12] When the Indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 BCE, Mohenjo-daro was abandoned.[10][13]\\r\\nThe ruins of the city remained undocumented for around 3,700 years until R. D. Banerji, an officer of the Archaeological Survey of India, visited the site in 1919ÿ20, identifying the Buddhist stupa (150ÿ500 CE) known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site's antiquity. This led to large-scale excavations of Mohenjo-daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924ÿ25, and John Marshall in 1925ÿ26.[14] In the 1930s, major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall, D. K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay. Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Ahmad Hasan Dani and Mortimer Wheeler. The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by Dr. George F. Dales. After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures, and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects. However, in the 1980s, German and Italian survey groups led by Dr. Michael Jansen and Dr. Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archeological techniques, such as architectural documentation, surface surveys, and localized probing, to gather further information about Mohenjo-daro.[3] A dry core drilling conducted in 2015 by Pakistan's National Fund for Mohenjo-daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area.[15]\\r\\nMohenjo-daro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid plan.[16] Most were built of fired and mortared brick; some incorporated sun-dried mud-brick and wooden superstructures. The covered area of Mohenjo-daro is estimated at 300 hectares.[17] The Oxford Handbook of Cities in World History offers a \\"weak\\" estimate of a peak population of around 40,000.[18]\\r\\nThe sheer size of the city, and its provision of public buildings and facilities, suggests a high level of social organization.[19] The city is divided into two parts, the so-called Citadel and the Lower City. The Citadel ÿ a mud-brick mound around 12 metres (39?ft) high ÿ is known to have supported public baths, a large residential structure designed to house about 5,000 citizens, and two large assembly halls. The city had a central marketplace, with a large central well. Individual households or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells. Waste water was channeled to covered drains that lined the major streets. Some houses, presumably those of more prestigious inhabitants, include rooms that appear to have been set aside for bathing, and one building had an underground furnace (known as a hypocaust), possibly for heated bathing. Most houses had inner courtyards, with doors that opened onto side-lanes. Some buildings had two stories.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1950, Sir Mortimer Wheeler identified one large building in Mohenjo-daro as a \\"Great Granary\\". Certain wall-divisions in its massive wooden superstructure appeared to be grain storage-bays, complete with air-ducts to dry the grain. According to Wheeler, carts would have brought grain from the countryside and unloaded them directly into the bays. However, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer noted the complete lack of evidence for grain at the \\"granary\\", which, he argued, might therefore be better termed a \\"Great Hall\\" of uncertain function.[13] Close to the \\"Great Granary\\" is a large and elaborate public bath, sometimes called the Great Bath. From a colonnaded courtyard, steps lead down to the brick-built pool, which was waterproofed by a lining of bitumen. The pool measures 12 metres (39?ft) long, 7 metres (23?ft) wide and 2.4 metres (7.9?ft) deep. It may have been used for religious purification. Other large buildings include a \\"Pillared Hall\\", thought to be an assembly hall of some kind, and the so-called \\"College Hall\\", a complex of buildings comprising 78 rooms, thought to have been a priestly residence.[citation needed]\\r\\nMohenjo-daro had no series of city walls, but was fortified with guard towers to the west of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is obvious from the identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there was some kind of political or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative center remains unclear.\\r\\nThe city also had large platforms perhaps intended as defense against flooding.[19] According to a theory first advanced by Wheeler, the city could have been flooded and silted over, perhaps six times, and later rebuilt in the same location.[21]\\r\\nNumerous objects found in excavation include seated and standing figures, copper and stone tools, carved seals, balance-scales and weights, gold and jasper jewellery, and children's toys.[22] Many important objects from Mohenjo-daro are conserved at the National Museum of India in Delhi and the National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi. In 1939, a representative collection of artefacts excavated at the site was transferred to the British Museum by the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India.[23]\\r\\nA bronze statuette dubbed the \\"Dancing Girl\\", 10.5 centimetres (4.1?in) high[24] and about 4,500 years old, was found in 'HR area' of Mohenjo-daro in 1926.[24] In 1973, British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler described the item as his favorite statuette:\\r\\n\\"She's about fifteen years old I should think, not more, but she stands there with bangles all the way up her arm and nothing else on. A girl perfectly, for the moment, perfectly confident of herself and the world. There's nothing like her, I think, in the world.\\"\\r\\nJohn Marshall, another archeologist at Mohenjo-daro, described the figure as \\"a young girl, her hand on her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet.\\"[25] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, \\"We may not be certain that she was a dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it\\". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.[24]\\r\\nIn 1927, a seated male soapstone figure was found in a building with unusually ornamental brickwork and a wall-niche. Though there is no evidence that priests or monarchs ruled Mohenjo-daro, archaeologists dubbed this dignified figure a \\"Priest-King.\\" The sculpture is 17.5 centimetres (6.9?in) tall, and shows a neatly bearded man with pierced earlobes and a fillet around his head, possibly all that is left of a once-elaborate hairstyle or head-dress; his hair is combed back. He wears an armband, and a cloak with drilled trefoil, single circle and double circle motifs, which show traces of red. His eyes might have originally been inlaid.[26]\\r\\nA seal discovered at the site bears the image of a seated, cross-legged and possibly ithyphallic figure surrounded by animals. The figure has been interpreted by some scholars as a yogi, and by others as a three-headed \\"proto-Shiva\\" as \\"Lord of Animals\\".\\r\\nSir Mortimer Wheeler was especially fascinated with this artifact, which he believed to be at least 4,500 years old. The necklace has an S-shaped clasp with seven strands, each over 4?ft long, of bronze-metal bead-like nuggets which connect each arm of the \\"S\\" in filigree. Each strand has between 220 and 230 of the many-faceted nuggets, and there are about 1,600 nuggets in total. The necklace weighs about 250 grams in total, and is presently held in a private collection in India.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn initial agreement to fund restoration was agreed through the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris on 27 May 1980. Contributions were made by a number of other countries to the project:\\r\\nPreservation work for Mohenjo-daro was suspended in December 1996 after funding from the Pakistani government and international organizations stopped. Site conservation work resumed in April 1997, using funds made available by the UNESCO. The 20-year funding plan provided $10 million to protect the site and standing structures from flooding. In 2011, responsibility for the preservation of the site was transferred to the government of Sindh.[27]\\r\\nCurrently the site is threatened by groundwater salinity and improper restoration. Many walls have already collapsed, while others are crumbling from the ground up. In 2012, Pakistani archaeologists warned that, without improved conservation measures, the site could disappear by 2030.[4][28]\\r\\nThe Mohenjo-daro site was further threatened in January 2014, when Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan People's Party chose the site for Sindh Festival's inauguration ceremony. This would have exposed the site to mechanical operations, including excavation and drilling. Farzand Masih, head of the Department of Archaeology at Punjab University warned that such activity was banned under the Antiquity Act, saying \\"You cannot even hammer a nail at an archaeological site.\\" On 31 January 2014, a case was filed in the Sindh High Court to bar the Sindh government from continuing with the event.[29][30]The festival was held by PPP at the historic site, despite all the protest by both national and international historians and educators.","input":"Why is mohenjo daro considered one of the most advanced cities of its time?"},{"output":"over 100 million records worldwide","context":"Prince's albums discography consists of thirty-nine studio albums (including five soundtrack albums), three live albums, seven compilation albums, seventeen video albums, and twelve extended plays.\\r\\nPrince's music career began when he signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1977 at 18 years of age. In 1978, he released his debut album, For You. He followed the release with Prince (1979), Dirty Mind (1980), and Controversy (1981), three albums that were certified platinum and shifted from For You's disco/soul route and instead blended New Wave, rock, pop, R&B, and funk, building up his success.\\r\\nHis 1982 album 1999, credited for being an enormous influence on the next few decades of dance, electro, house, and techno music,[1] sold over six million copies worldwide and became the fifth best-selling album of 1983.\\r\\nThe next album, Purple Rain, the first of three credited to Prince and The Revolution, was the 1984 soundtrack to his film-debut of the same name. In a runaway phenomenon of success, it sold over 22 million copies around the world and at one point, Prince had the number-one song, album, and film in the United States, a feat matching The Beatles' 1964 achievement with A Hard Day's Night. Soon tiring of the project's enormous success and consequent over-exposure, he and the band recorded throughout touring and planned a change of image and musical direction by means of a quick follow-up. 1985's Around the World in a Day released within a year of its predecessor and days after the lucrative Purple Rain tour was curtailed, had no lead single nor advance promotion. It inaugurated his own Paisley Park record label, and eschewing Purple Rain 's rock and metal elements, headed off into psychedelic influences and instrumentation.\\r\\nPrince and The Revolution continued multi-platinum success with the soundtrack to his second movie Under the Cherry Moon, 1986's Parade. It showed further expansion of his musical palette, in ongoing collaboration with band members Wendy Melvoin, Lisa Coleman and composer Clare Fischer. The film and album brought into play Broadway-style orchestration and French-influenced chanson arrangements but, like its predecessors, it also included tracks written, performed and produced entirely solo by Prince.\\r\\nFollowing disputes about musical direction and a new style of presentation with an expanded 'soul-revue' flavor, Prince disbanded The Revolution at the end of the tour.\\r\\nHe resumed a solo career with 1987's Sign o' the Times, an experimental double album, which topped several critic end-of-year polls and was Grammy nominated for Album of the Year. The album's projected tour would largely be cancelled as Prince concentrated on developing the acclaimed concert film of the same name, filming in Europe and at his new Paisley Park facility in Chanhassen.\\r\\nAn untitled follow-up (eventually known as The Black Album), promotional copies of which were distributed before it was cancelled, became the most bootlegged album in the history of the music business to date. After a period in which he'd seemed more accessible and grounded, it also restored earlier enigma.\\r\\n1988's Lovesexy (his first UK number-one record) built further on his mystique while recycling one of the Black Album tracks. During its subsequent tour, under some financial pressure, he suddenly became involved with production for a highly anticipated forthcoming Warner Bros. film production directed by Tim Burton, writing and producing songs for its soundtrack. His Batman album, inspired by the movie, ended his decade by selling 11 million copies worldwide as one of two soundtracks to Batman, the biggest-grossing movie in cinema history to that date.\\r\\nPrince entered the 1990s with the soundtrack to his third movie, Graffiti Bridge. Its moderate success was dwarfed by his 1991 album Diamonds and Pearls which, mixing elements of new jack swing, R&B, jazz-soul, and hip hop and introducing his new band The New Power Generation, spawned several huge hit singles. In its wake, Prince signed what was touted as the biggest deal in music history, worth a reported $100m. However, after his 1992 follow-up, the Love Symbol Album, only scraped the five million copies he needed to advantage himself under the deal, he began to become dissatisfied with his record company, fearing they hadn't adequately promoted it, perhaps to disadvantage his side of the deal. Warner countered with requests for him to slow down on delivery of new projects and extend their term of promotion, a request denied by Prince. It was the beginning of a dispute which mushroomed rapidly.\\r\\nBy 1993, Prince had changed his name to an un-pronounceable symbol in order to escape the terms of his contract as the Warner-owned product, 'Prince'. He began demanding faster release by Warner of more projects than they were prepared to promote. In a growing effort to eject himself from his contract, his demands increased further to include ownership of his master recordings and he notoriously began to refer to himself as a 'Slave' to the company, wearing this word on his face in public and in negotiation with the label with resultant public embarrassment for both Warner's public image and his own. He also began to pursue erratic and unconventional promotional methods for his projects, whether under aliases or as part of projects by his band, now being planned under the auspices of a new label, NPG Records which Prince increasingly operated as if an independent venture using Warner as distributor.\\r\\nIn return for co-operating with Warner's The Hits/The B-Sides compilation albums, Prince, under his new name, was granted the opportunity to trial-release independently of Warner on his NPG imprint using an external distributor and label. The one-off experiment, his single \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\\" should have demonstrated that he needed the clout of Warner Bros. for continued success but the single instead became an international smash, his first UK number one single, and wrangles between the parties continued with Warner Bros. gradually coming round to the idea of ending their arrangement.\\r\\nTo this end, Warner released several 'Prince' albums in quick succession, including Come and the first official release of his funk 'bootleg' The Black Album in 1994. The rock-influenced The Gold Experience had been planned by Prince for release under his new name in competition with Warner's 'Prince' products but it was delayed by the label until 1995, losing the momentum of its hit single. By 1996, his sales were at a fraction of what they had been prior to the dispute and the final new album he delivered to the label, 1996's Chaos and Disorder, saw his lowest chart performance since 1980.\\r\\nPrince then began an independent career, licensing to record companies on limited deals or self-distributing via a succession of online operations. The first project, Emancipation was a 3-LP set licensed to EMI later in 1996. He continued with a bootleg-style collection of outtakes, Crystal Ball, which sold initially via his website in 1998. Now taking 100% of retail minus costs, Prince found even reduced sales to be much more profitable than at his commercial peak with Purple Rain under his prior percentage deal with Warner. As news of his achievement began to circulate in the changing music industry, Prince's reputation and influence began to recover as his prior struggles were vindicated. His innovation was later rewarded when he received a Webby award, the first recognition of his stance against major record companies as prescient of changes to come later in the industry as a whole and of his own online retailing as visionary and pioneering.\\r\\nIn the meantime, Prince was not advantaged by being ahead of the times. The poppy Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic in 1999, under a one-off deal with Arista Records, failed to deliver an anticipated return to former mainstream chart success. In 2001, while Warner released another successful compilation The Very Best of Prince and now using his birth name again, put out the critically successful jazz-influenced album The Rainbow Children but it struggled to achieve more than cursory media attention and saw poor sales. A solo piano album One Night Alone, sold again via his online operation, gave its name under slight variation to his first live set, the box set One Nite Alone...Live, which saw the big hits of his past redeveloped in the jazz mode of The Rainbow Children alongside many of its tracks in live form.\\r\\nAdapting to low-sales profitability and developing his hardcore fanbase, now in close contact with his online business Prince, during the early part of the new century, was releasing much more low-key albums via his websites developing a prescient subscription-model for user music purchases.\\r\\nHe was also optimising and downsizing his touring setup and taking much closer involvement with its administration and management which involved minimal contractual involvements and more spontaneous campaigning on promotion and live appearances. A major mainstream 'comeback' soon followed with 2004's Musicology tour, whose album garnered five Grammy nominations and, availing of a loophole (closed behind him), in chart regulations, embedded album sales within ticket sales for the tour which were among the strongest of that year. The result that the album peaked within the Billboard Top 3.\\r\\nThese cutting-edge promotional tactics were extremely effective in restoring Prince rapidly to the commercial high ground, and 3121 (2006), became his first album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. The follow-up, Planet Earth (2007), licensed to record companies for the world was suddenly given away free as a cover-mount on a British newspaper, a very profitable exercise for Prince, particularly as in addition to providing an income from the paper equivalent to high sales, it also served to launch and promote a record-breaking single-venue booking in London, his 21 Nights residency at the Millennium Dome. Its follow-on live album Indigo Nights (2008), a collection of aftershow performances at the venue, was marketed within an expensive coffee-table book.\\r\\nThe three-disc 2009 set Lotusflow3r / MPLSound sold very well via the Target retailer in the US again seeing the inside of the top three in the Billboard 200. A further British newspaper cover-mount deal distributed 20Ten in 2010 although the exercise had reduced impact on the second outing and critical reception was poor. It was with the solo album Art Official Ageand his new band 3rdeyegirl's debut Plectrumelectrum in 2014, that Prince finally returned to critical favour and headlines following the dynamic and spontaneous HitnRun tour which took London's media by storm and gave its name to the band's next album Hit n Run Phase One. First released exclusively on the new Tidal streaming service on September 7, 2015[2][3][4] before being released on CD on September 15, 2015 by NPG Records.[5][5][6] His final album before his death, Hit n Run Phase Two, was released on December 11, 2015, also through Tidal. In the weeks following his death, 19 different Prince albums charted on the Billboard 200 all at the same time, and he became the first and only artist ever to have 5 albums in the Billboard top 10 simultaneously.[7]\\r\\nPrince has sold over 100 million records worldwide,[8] including 48.9 million certified units in the United States, and over 10 million records in the United Kingdom. Prince has been ranked as the 21st most successful act of all time,[9] the 26th most successful chart artist worldwide,[10] including 27 overall number-one entries,[11] and being the most successful chart act of the 1980s,[12] and tenth most successful chart act of the 1990s.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this section albums are listed that only have been made available for download on the internet.","input":"How many albums did prince sell in his lifetime?"},{"output":"Case Keenum","context":"The Minnesota Vikings are a professional American football team based in Minneapolis. They are members of the North Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). A franchise was granted to Minneapolis businessmen Bill Boyer, H. P. Skoglund and Max Winter in 1959 as a member of the American Football League (AFL). The ownership forfeited their AFL membership in January 1960 and received the National Football League's 14th franchise on January 28, 1960 that started play in 1961.[1]\\r\\nThe Vikings have had 36 starting quarterbacks in the history of their franchise; they have never had more than three starting quarterbacks in one season.[a] The Vikings' past starting quarterbacks include Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Fran Tarkenton, Brett Favre and Warren Moon.[2] The team's first starting quarterback was George Shaw; he was replaced by Tarkenton in the franchise's first game, and the future Hall of Famer retained the starting role for most of the remainder of the season. As of the 2017 season, Minnesota's starting quarterback is Case Keenum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vikings' starting quarterback for the first game of their inaugural season against the Chicago Bears was George Shaw.[3] However, he was replaced by Fran Tarkenton early on, who passed for four touchdowns in the game and rushed for one more. Tarkenton went on to start in 10 of the Vikings' 14 regular season matches that year.[4] He played for the Vikings until 1967, when he was traded to the New York Giants,[5] and Joe Kapp took his place as the Vikings' starting quarterback .[6] Kapp led the Vikings to their first playoff appearance in 1968,[7] but he was traded to the Boston Patriots in 1970 and Gary Cuozzo stepped up to replace him.[6][8] Cuozzo remained in the position for two seasons, moving to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1972.[8]\\r\\nTarkenton returned for another seven-year spell as the Vikings' starting quarterback in 1972, continuing until his retirement in 1978,[5] at which point Tommy Kramer was promoted from the second string in his second season with the franchise.[9] Kramer was injured for most of the 1983 season, so Steve Dils served as the starting quarterback for most of the season,[10] before Kramer reclaimed the position in 1984.[9] For the 1987 season, Kramer shared quarterback duties with Wade Wilson, before Wilson took over on a permanent basis from 1988.[11] Wilson was replaced by the emerging Rich Gannon in 1990,[12] but Gannon was released after the 1992 season and veteran Jim McMahon took over for the 1993 season until the arrival of Warren Moon in 1994.[13]\\r\\nMoon retained the starting quarterback spot for two seasons,[14] but suffered a broken collarbone halfway through his third season with the Vikings and was replaced by Brad Johnson for the remainder of the season.[15] The Vikings had three starting quarterbacks in the following three seasons?ÿ Johnson (1997),[15] Randall Cunningham (1998)[16] and Jeff George (1999)[17]?ÿ before Daunte Culpepper began a six-year spell in his second year in the NFL in 2000.[18] He suffered a serious knee injury during the 2005 season, and Johnson took over in the position again, having re-signed the previous summer after seven years away from the franchise.[15] Culpepper then joined the Miami Dolphins in 2006,[18] giving Johnson another full year as starting quarterback, [15] only to be replaced by sophomore Tarvaris Jackson in 2007.[19] The 2008 season commenced with Jackson starting at quarterback,[19] but he was replaced after two games by Gus Frerotte, who was returning to the Vikings from the St. Louis Rams after having been traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2005.[20] Jackson regained the job for the final three games and led the Vikings to their first divisional title since 2000, and their first NFC North title.[19]\\r\\nIn 2009, the Vikings recruited veteran quarterback Brett Favre out of retirement to be their new starting quarterback.[21] In Week 13 of the 2010 season, Favre suffered a chest injury that ended his NFL-record streak of consecutive starts at 297 (321 including postseason games), and Tarvaris Jackson reclaimed the starting spot for Week 14. However, Jackson was injured himself in Week 15, giving rookie Joe Webb a chance to stake a claim for the position. He was unable to hold onto the position as Donovan McNabb was signed as a free agent to replace Favre, who retired at the end of the 2010 season. After going 1ÿ5 through the first six games of 2011, though, McNabb was replaced by first-round draft pick Christian Ponder, who retained the starting position for the remainder of the season and for the whole of 2012. However, he was plagued by indifferent form and the Vikings signed Matt Cassel ÿ recently released by the Kansas City Chiefs. When Ponder suffered an injury early in the 2013 season, Cassel was given his first start for the Vikings in week 4 in the NFL International Series game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Wembley Stadium, London. He started the following game, but was replaced in week 7 by Josh Freeman, recently signed after his release by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, he was injured during the game and did not make another start for the Vikings, allowing Ponder to reclaim the starting role. Cassel then returned as the starter in week 14, and retained the role for the rest of the season and into 2014. After three games, he was placed on injured reserve and first-round draft pick Teddy Bridgewater took over for the week 4 game against the Atlanta Falcons. Bridgewater himself was injured late in the game, allowing Ponder the chance to come back in for the following week, but the rookie soon returned and has held the starting berth until suffering a knee injury in practice during the 2016 preseason. Shaun Hill started the season opener and Sam Bradford took over in week 2.\\r\\nSeven Vikings quarterbacks have made at least one start in their rookie season: Tarkenton in 1961, Vander Kelen in 1963, Kramer in 1977, Jackson in 2006, Webb in 2010, Ponder in 2011 and Bridgewater in 2014.\\r\\nHaving been the franchise's starting quarterback for 13 seasons (longer than any other Vikings player), Fran Tarkenton holds the record for the most starts in a Vikings jersey, and those for the most wins and ties.[93] He is also the franchise's leading passer in terms of numbers of attempts, completions, total yards gained and passing touchdowns, although Brett Favre has the best pass completion percentage.[93] However, Tarkenton has also thrown the most interceptions.[93] The record for the longest completed pass by a Vikings starting quarterback is held by Gus Frerotte, who threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian in a home game against the Chicago Bears in the 2008 season.[93][94]\\r\\nTarkenton is also the franchise leader for rushing attempts and rushing yards as a quarterback, but it is Daunte Culpepper ÿ with 72 fewer rushing yards on 10 fewer attempts than Tarkenton ÿ who has the most rushing touchdowns.[95] Joe Webb holds the record for the longest rush with a 65-yard run in Minnesota's 34ÿ28 road loss to the Detroit Lions in 2011.[95][96]","input":"Who was the starting quarterback for the vikings?"},{"output":"Yahoo!","context":"Yahoo! was started at Stanford University. It was founded in January 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, who were Electrical Engineering graduate students when they created a website named \\"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\\". The Guide was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In April 1994, Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web was renamed \\"Yahoo!\\".[1][2] The yahoo.com domain was created on January 18, 1995.[3]\\r\\nYahoo! grew rapidly throughout the 1990s and diversified into a web portal, followed by numerous high-profile acquisitions. The company's stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble and closed at an all-time high of US$118.75 in 2000;[4] however, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached an all-time low of US$8.11 in 2001.[5] Yahoo! formally rejected an acquisition bid from the Microsoft Corporation in 2008.[6] In early 2012, the largest layoff in Yahoo!'s history was completed and 2,000 employees (14 percent of the workforce) lost their jobs.[7]\\r\\nCarol Bartz replaced co-founder Jerry Yang as CEO in January 2009,[8] but was fired by the board of directors in September 2011; Tim Morse was appointed as interim CEO following Bartz's departure.[9] Former PayPal president Scott Thompson became CEO in January 2012 and after he resigned was replaced by Ross Levinsohn as the company's interim CEO on May 13, 2012. On July 16, former Google executive Marissa Mayer, became the CEO of the company.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the April 1994 renaming of Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web to Yahoo!, Yang and Filo said that \\"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\\" was a suitable backronym for this name, but they insisted they had selected the name because they liked the word's general definition, as in Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift: \\"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.\\" Its URL was akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo.\\r\\nWhile the yahoo.com domain was created in January 1995,[3] by the end of 1994 Yahoo! had already received one million hits. Yang and Filo realized their website had massive business potential, and on March 2, 1995, Yahoo! was incorporated.[11] Yang and Filo sought out the advice of entrepreneur Randy Adams for a recommendation of a venture capital firm and Adams introduced them to Michael Moritz.[12] On April 5, 1995, Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital provided Yahoo! with two rounds of venture capital, raising approximately $3 million.[13][14] On April 12, 1996, Yahoo! had its initial public offering, raising $33.8 million by selling 2.6 million shares at the opening bid of $13 each.\\r\\nThe word \\"Yahoo\\" had previously been trademarked for barbecue sauce, knives (by EBSCO Industries) and human propelled watercraft (by Old Town Canoe Co.). Therefore, in order to get control of the trademark, Yang and Filo added the exclamation mark to the name.[15] However, the exclamation mark is often incorrectly omitted when referring to Yahoo!.\\r\\nSrinija Srinivasan, an alumna of Stanford University, was hired as Yahoo!'s fifth employee as \\"Ontological Yahoo!\\" to assist Yang and Filo with organizing the content on the internet.[16][17]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, Yahoo!, MSN, Lycos, Excite and other web portals were growing rapidly. Web portal providers rushed to acquire companies to expand their range of services, generally with the goal of increasing the time each user stays within the portal.\\r\\nOn March 8, 1997, Yahoo! acquired online communications company Four11. Four11's webmail service, Rocketmail, became Yahoo! Mail. Yahoo! also acquired ClassicGames.com and turned it into Yahoo! Games. Yahoo! then acquired direct marketing company Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc. on October 12, 1998.[18] In January 1999, Yahoo! acquired web hosting provider GeoCities. Another company Yahoo! took over was eGroups, which became Yahoo! Groups in June 2000. On March 8, 1998, Yahoo! launched Yahoo! Pager,[19] an instant messaging service that was renamed Yahoo! Messenger a year later.\\r\\nWhen acquiring companies, Yahoo! often changed the relevant terms of service. For example, they claimed intellectual property rights for content on their servers, unlike the previous policies of the companies they acquired. As a result, many of the acquisitions were controversial and unpopular with users of the existing services.[citation needed]\\r\\nYahoo! stock doubled in price in the last month of 1999.[20] On January 3, 2000, at the height of the dot-com boom, Yahoo! stock closed at an all-time high of $118.75 a share. Sixteen days later, shares in Yahoo! Japan became the first stock in Japanese history to trade at over 100,000,000, reaching a price of 101.4 million yen ($962,140 at that time).[21]\\r\\nOn February 7, 2000, yahoo.com was brought to a halt for a few hours, as the victim of a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS).[22][23][24] On the next day, its shares rose about $16, or 4.5 percent as the failure was blamed on hackers rather than on an internal glitch, unlike a fault with eBay earlier that year.\\r\\nDuring the dot-com boom, the cable news network CNBC reported that Yahoo! and eBay were discussing a 50/50 merger.[25][26] Although the merger never materialized, the two companies decided to form a marketing/advertising alliance six years later in 2006.[27]\\r\\nOn June 26, 2000, Yahoo! and Google signed an agreement which would tap the Google engine to power searches made on yahoo.com.[28]\\r\\nYahoo! was one of the few surviving companies after the dot-com bubble burst. Nevertheless, on September 26, 2001, Yahoo! stock closed at an all-time low of $8.11.\\r\\nYahoo! formed partnerships with telecommunications and Internet providers to create content-rich broadband services to compete with AOL. For example, on June 3, 2002, SBC and Yahoo! launched a national co-branded dialup service.[29][30] In July 2003, BT Openworld announced an alliance with Yahoo! [31][32] On August 23, 2005, Yahoo! and Verizon launched an integrated DSL service.[33]\\r\\nIn late 2002, Yahoo! began to bolster its search services by acquiring other search engines. In December 2002, Yahoo! acquired Inktomi. In February 2005, Yahoo! acquired Konfabulator and rebranded it Yahoo! Widgets,[34] a desktop application, and in July 2003, it acquired Overture Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries AltaVista and AlltheWeb. On February 18, 2004, Yahoo! dropped Google-powered results and returned to using its own technology to provide search results.[35]\\r\\nIn March 2004, Yahoo! launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo! search engine after payment.[36] This scheme was lucrative, but proved unpopular both with website marketers (who were reluctant to pay), and the public (who were unhappy about the paid-for listings being indistinguishable from other search results).[37] As of October 2006, Paid Inclusion ceased to guarantee any commercial listing and only helped the paid inclusion customers, by crawling their site more often and by providing some statistics on the searches that led to the page and some additional smart links (provided by customers as feeds) below the actual url.\\r\\nIn 2004, in response to Google's release of Gmail, Yahoo! upgraded the storage of all free Yahoo! Mail accounts from 4 MB to 1 GB, and all Yahoo! Mail Plus accounts to 2 GB. On July 9, 2004, Yahoo! acquired e-mail provider Oddpost to add an Ajax interface to Yahoo! Mail Beta.[38] Google also released Google Talk, a voice over IP and instant messaging service, on August 24, 2005. On October 13, 2005, Yahoo! and Microsoft announced that Yahoo! Messenger and MSN Messenger would become interoperable. In 2007, Yahoo! took out the storage meters, thus allowing users unlimited storage.[39]\\r\\nYahoo! continued acquiring companies to expand its range of services, particularly Web 2.0 services. Yahoo! Launch became Yahoo! Music in February 2005. On March 20, 2005, Yahoo! purchased photo sharing service Flickr.[40] That same month, the company launched its blogging and social networking service Yahoo! 360. In June 2005, Yahoo! acquired blo.gs, a service based on RSS feed aggregation. Yahoo! then bought online social event calendar Upcoming.org, in October 2005. Yahoo! acquired social bookmark site del.icio.us in December 2005 and then playlist sharing community webjay in January 2009.\\r\\nYahoo! Next is an incubation ground for future Yahoo! technologies currently in their beta testing phase, similar to Google Labs. It contains forums for Yahoo! users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo! technologies.\\r\\nIn early 2006, Yahoo! offered users the chance to beta test a new version of the Yahoo! homepage. However, it currently only supports Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. Users of other browsers, such as Opera, have criticized Yahoo! for this move. Yahoo! says they intend to support additional browsers in the future.\\r\\nOn August 27, 2007, Yahoo! released a new version of Yahoo! Mail. It added Yahoo! Messenger integration (which included Windows Live Messenger due to the networks' federation) and free text messages (not necessarily free to the receiver) to mobile phones in the U.S., Canada, India, and the Philippines.[41]\\r\\nOn January 29, 2008, Yahoo! announced that the company was laying off 1,000 employees, as the company had suffered severely in its inability to effectively compete with industry search leader Google. The cuts represented 7 percent of the company's workforce of 14,300.[42]\\r\\nIn February 2008, Yahoo! acquired Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Maven Networks, a supplier of internet video players and video advertising tools, for approximately $160 million.\\r\\nYahoo! announced on November 17, 2008, that Yang would be stepping down as CEO.[43]\\r\\nOn December 10, 2008, Yahoo! began laying off 1,520 employees around the world as the company managed its way through the global economic downturn[44]\\r\\nMicrosoft and Yahoo! pursued merger discussions in 2005, 2006, and 2007, that were all ultimately unsuccessful. At the time, analysts were skeptical about the wisdom of a business combination by these two firms.[45][46]\\r\\nOn February 1, 2008, after its friendly takeover offer was rebuffed by Yahoo!, Microsoft made an unsolicited takeover bid to buy Yahoo! for $44.6 billion in cash and stock.[47][48] Days later, Yahoo! considered alternatives to the merger with Microsoft, including a merger with Internet giant Google[49] or a potential transaction with News Corp.[50] However, on February 11, 2008, Yahoo! decided to reject Microsoft's offer as \\"substantially undervaluing\\" Yahoo!'s brand, audience, investments, and growth prospects.[51]\\r\\nOn February 22, two Detroit-based pension companies sued Yahoo! and its board of directors for allegedly breaching their duty to shareholders by opposing Microsoft's takeover bid and pursuing \\"value destructive\\" third-party deals.[52] In early March, Google CEO Eric Schmidt went on record saying that he was concerned that a potential Microsoft-Yahoo! merger might hurt the internet by compromising its openness.[53] The value of Microsoft's cash and stock offer declined with Microsoft's stock price, falling to $42.2 billion by April 4.[54] On April 5, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer sent a letter to Yahoo!'s board of directors stating that if within three weeks they had not accepted the deal, Microsoft would approach shareholders directly in hopes of electing a new board and moving forward with merger talks (a hostile takeover).[55] In response, Yahoo! stated on April 7 that they were not against a merger, but that they wanted a better offer. In addition, they stated that Microsoft's \\"aggressive\\" approach was worsening their relationship and the chances of a \\"friendly\\" merger.[56] Later the same day, Yahoo! stated that the original $44.6 billion offer was not acceptable.[56] Following this, there was considerable discussion of having Time Warner's AOL and Yahoo! merge, instead of the originally proposed Microsoft deal.[57]\\r\\nOn May 3, 2008, Microsoft withdrew the offer. During a meeting between Ballmer and Yang, Microsoft had offered to raise its offer by $5 billion to $33 per share, while Yahoo! demanded $37 per share. One of Ballmer's lieutenants suggested that Yang would implement a poison pill to make the takeover as difficult as possible, saying \\"They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place.\\"[58][59]\\r\\nAnalysts said that Yahoo!'s shares, which closed at $28.67 per share on May 2, were likely to drop below $25 per share and perhaps as low as $20 per share on May 5, which would put significant pressure on Yang to engineer a turnaround of the company. Some suggested that institutional investors would file lawsuits against Yahoo!'s board of directors for not acting in shareholder interest by refusing Microsoft's offer.[60][61]\\r\\nOn May 5, 2008, following Microsoft's withdrawal, Yahoo!'s stock plunged some 15% lower to $23.02 per share in Monday trading and trimmed about $6 billion off of its market capitalization.[62]\\r\\nOn June 12, 2008, Yahoo! announced that it had ended all talks with Microsoft about purchasing either part of the business (the search advertising business) or all of the company. Talks had taken place the previous weekend (June 8), during which Microsoft allegedly told Yahoo! that it was no longer interested in a purchase of the entire company at the price offered earlier ÿ $33 per share. Also, on June 12, Yahoo! announced a non-exclusive search advertising alliance with Google.[63] Upon this announcement, many executives and senior employees announced their plans to leave the company as it appeared they had lost confidence in Yahoo!'s strategies. According to market analysts, these pending departures impacted Wall Street's perception of the company.[64]\\r\\nOn July 7, 2008, Microsoft said it would reconsider proposing another bid for Yahoo! if the company's nine directors were ousted at the annual meeting scheduled to be held on August 1, 2008. Microsoft believed it would be able to better negotiate with a new board.[65]\\r\\nBillionaire investor Carl Icahn, calling the current board irrational in its approach to talks with Microsoft, launched a proxy fight to replace Yahoo!'s board. On July 21, 2008, Yahoo! settled with Carl Icahn, agreeing to appoint him and two allies to an expanded board.\\r\\nOn November 20, 2008, almost 10 months after Microsoft's initial offer of $33 per share, Yahoo!'s stock (YHOO) dropped to a 52-week low, trading at only $8.94 per share.[66]\\r\\nOn November 30, 2008, Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo!'s search business for $20 billion.[67]\\r\\nOn July 29, 2009, it was announced in a 10-year deal that Microsoft would have full access to Yahoo!'s search engine to be used in future Microsoft projects for its search engine, Bing.[68] Under the deal, Microsoft was not required to pay any cash up front to Yahoo!. The day after the deal was announced, Yahoo!'s share price declined more than 10% to $15.14 per share, about 60% lower than Microsoft's takeover bid a year earlier.\\r\\nOn January 13, 2009, Yahoo! appointed Carol Bartz, former executive chairman of Autodesk, as its new chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors.[69] Yahoo! tried to change its direction after chief executive Carol Bartz replaced co-founder Jerry Yang.[8]\\r\\nIn July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! agreed to a deal that would see Yahoo!'s websites use both Microsoft's search technology and search advertising.[70] Yahoo! in turn would become the sales team for banner advertising for both companies.[70] While Microsoft would provide algorithmic search results, Yahoo! would control the presentation and personalization of results for searches on its pages.[70]\\r\\nOn July 21, 2009, Yahoo! launched a new version of its front page, called Metro. The new page allowed users to customize it through the prominent \\"My Favorites\\" panel on the left side and integrate third-party web services and launch them within one page. Such third-party applications include pages of Netflix, E-trade, Facebook, and other sites.[71]\\r\\nOn October 28, 2009, Bartz told PCWorld that she struggled with the question of what Yahoo! is when she took over as CEO in January 2009. After talking to many users in about 10 countries, she said, Yahoo! executives concluded that users consider it their \\"home on the Internet.\\"[72]\\r\\nIn September 2011, Bartz sent an email to Yahoo! employees saying she was removed from her position at Yahoo! by the company's chairman Roy Bostock via a phone call.[73] CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.[74][75]\\r\\nOn January 4, 2012, Scott Thompson, former President of PayPal, was named the new chief executive officer.[76]\\r\\nIn early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as the new CEO, many rumors spread about large layoffs looming. Kara Swisher who covers Yahoo at All Things Digital reported that Yahoo's Chief Product Officer Blake Irving Resigned,[77] Andrei Broder, who was VP of computational advertising and chief scientist of the Advertising Product Group, as well as Jianchang (JC) Mao, who headed advertising sciences left the company. This followed the departures of Yahoo! Labs head Prabhakar Raghavan who left for Google, and Raghu Ramakrishnan, who went to Microsoft.[78]\\r\\nOn April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of 14,100 workers employed by Yahoo. Yahoo! said it will save around $375 million annually after the layoffs are completed at end of 2012.[79]\\r\\nOn March 14, Yahoo! filed a lawsuit against Facebook over the alleged infringement of 10 patents.[80][81][82] Facebook responded by counter suing Yahoo!.[83][84][85]\\r\\nIn an email memo sent to employees in April 2012, Scott Thomson re-iterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He defined customers as both users and advertisers. He also completely re-organized the company. The reorganization took effect on May 1, 2012 and included operations in three major groups for Yahoo!  Consumer, Regions and Technology.\\r\\nThe Consumer group has three groups: Media, Connections, and Commerce. The customers of this group are the users of Yahoo!.\\r\\nThe Regions group operates three regions: ? Americas, APAC, and EMEA. The customers of this group are the advertisers of Yahoo!.\\r\\nThe Technology group includes Core Platforms, and Central Technology. It provides technology and support to the other two major groups.\\r\\nThe Corporate group (Finance, Legal, and HR) remains unchanged and continues to support the new groups.[86][87][88][89][90][91]\\r\\nOn May 3, 2012, news broke out that Thompson's biography at Yahoo was incorrect. The CEO's biography stated that he held a dual accounting and computer science degree from Stonehill College, whereas investigation revealed that Thompson's degree was solely in accounting, and not in Computer Science. The revelation came from Dan Loeb, founder of Third Point LLC, which held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, who had been trying to gain seats on the board of directors of Yahoo![92][93][94]\\r\\nIn response to the crisis, Yahoo!'s board of directors formed a three-member committee to review Thompson's academic credentials and the vetting process that preceded his selection as CEO. The review committee's chairman is Alfred Amoroso, who joined Yahoo!'s board in February 2012. The other directors on the panel are John Hayes and Thomas McInerney, who both joined in April 2012. The committee retained Terry Bird as independent counsel.[95]\\r\\nOn May 13, 2012, Scott Thompson was replaced by Ross Levinsohn as the company's interim CEO.[96] In June 2012, Yahoo! hired former Google director, Michael G. Barrett as its Chief Revenue Officer.[97][98]\\r\\nOn July 16, 2012, former Google executive and Walmart corporate director Marissa Mayer was named as Yahoo! CEO and President, and youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company.[99]\\r\\nOn May 19, 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo's board had approved an all-cash deal to purchase the six-year-old blogging website Tumblr. The announcement reportedly signifies a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquire start-up Internet companies that generate low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The Wall Street Journal stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy the company's need for \\"a thriving social-networking and communications hub.\\" Yahoo will pay US$1.1 billion for Tumblr, and the company's CEO and founder David Karp will remain a large shareholder.[100]\\r\\nThe revamp of the Yahoo-owned photography service Flickr was launched in Times Square, New York, U.S. on May 20, 2013 in an event that was attended by the city's mayor and a large contingency of journalists. Eleven billboards in Times Square advertised the website's new tagline \\"biggr, spectaculr, wherevr.\\" as part of the launch and Yahoo stated that it will provide Flickr users with a free terabyte of storage. The official announcement of the Tumblr acquisition was also included in the May 20 event.[101]\\r\\nThe media reported on Yahoo!'s interest in the video streaming site Hulu on May 26, 2013. Under Mayer's leadership, Yahoo!'s bid is worth between US$600 and $800 million, as a variety of options that consist of different circumstances were put forward by the company.[102] As of May 28, 2013, Yahoo!'s videos attract 45 million unique visitors a month, while Hulu has 24 million visitorsthe combination of the two audiences can place Yahoo! in the second-most popular position after Google and its subsidiary YouTube.[103]\\r\\nOn August 2, 2013 Yahoo Inc announced the acquisition of social web browser concern RockMelt. With the acquisition, RockMelt team, including the concern's CEO Eric Vishria and CTO Tim Howes will be the part of Yahoo team. As a result, all the RockMelt apps and existing web services will go off from August 31.[104]\\r\\nOn August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo! announced that it will be introducing the final version of the new logo on 5 September 2013 at 4:00?a.m. UTC. To mark the occasion, the company launched a \\"30 days of change\\" campaign that involved releasing a variation of the logo on each of the 30 days leading up to the revelation date.[105][106]\\r\\nData collated by comScore during July 2013 revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo! websites during the month in comparison to Google websitesthe occasion was the first time that Yahoo! outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not incorporate visit statistics for the Yahoo!-owned Tumblr website or mobile phone usage.[107]\\r\\nOn February 11, 2014, Yahoo! has acquired a social diary company named Wander.[108]\\r\\nOn February 13, 2014, Yahoo! acquired Distill, a technical recruiting company.[109]\\r\\nOn September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach in which hackers stole information associated with at least 500 million user accounts in late 2014.[110] According to the BBC, this was the largest technical breach reported to date.[111] Specific details of material taken include names, email addresses, telephone numbers, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers, dates of birth, and encrypted passwords.[112] The breach used manufactured web cookies to falsify login credentials, allowing hackers to gain access to any account without a password.[113][114][115] On December 14, 2016 a separate data breach, occurring earlier around August 2013 was reported. This breach affected over 1 billion user accounts and is again considered the largest discovered in the history of the Internet.[116]\\r\\nOn January 9, 2017, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer announces she will step down from Yahoo's board of directors if its sale to Verizon goes through. She also announced that when that deal closed Yahoo! will rename itself to Altaba.[117][118][119][120][121]","input":"What did jerry yang and david filo develop?"},{"output":"the end of 2014","context":"A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fuelled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fuelling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], there are 3 hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai, the Hyundai ix35 FCEV, and the Honda Clarity. Several other companies are working to develop hydrogen cars. As of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from natural gas. It can be produced using renewable sources, but that is an expensive process.[3] Integrated wind-to-hydrogen (power-to-gas) plants, using electrolysis of water, are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with hydrogen production using natural gas.[4] The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high carbon emissions intensity when produced from natural gas, capital cost burden, low energy content per unit volume, production and compression of hydrogen, and the large investment in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles.[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAutomobiles, buses, forklifts, trains, PHB bicycles, canal boats, cargo bikes, golf carts, motorcycles, wheelchairs, ships, airplanes, submarines, and rockets can already run on hydrogen, in various forms. NASA used hydrogen to launch Space Shuttles into space. A working toy model car runs on solar power, using a regenerative fuel cell to store energy in the form of hydrogen and oxygen gas. It can then convert the fuel back into water to release the solar energy.[8] Since the advent of hydraulic fracturing the key concern for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is consumer and public policy confusion concerning the adoption of natural gas powered hydrogen vehicles with heavy hidden emissions to the detriment of environmentally friendly transportation.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA land-speed record for a hydrogen-powered vehicle of 286.476 miles per hour (461.038?km/h) was set by Ohio State University's Buckeye Bullet 2, which achieved a \\"flying-mile\\" speed of 280.007 miles per hour (450.628?km/h) at the Bonneville Salt Flats in August 2008. A record of 207.297 miles per hour (333.612?km/h) was set by a prototype Ford Fusion Hydrogen 999 Fuel Cell Race Car at the Bonneville Salt Flats, in August 2007, using a large compressed oxygen tank to increase power.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], there are 3 hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai, the Hyundai ix35 FCEV, and the Honda Clarity.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nToyota launched its first production fuel cell vehicle (FCV), the Mirai, in Japan at the end of 2014 and began sales in California, mainly the Los Angeles area, in 2015.[11] The car has a range of 312?mi (502?km) and takes about five minutes to refill its hydrogen tank. The initial sale price in Japan was about 7 million yen ($69,000).[12] Former European Parliament President Pat Cox estimated that Toyota would initially lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold.[13] Many automobile companies have introduced demonstration models in limited numbers (see List of fuel cell vehicles and List of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles).[14][15] One disadvantage of hydrogen compared to other automobile fuels is its low density.[16][17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 BMW leased hydrogen technology from Toyota, and a group formed by Ford Motor Company, Daimler AG, and Nissan announced a collaboration on hydrogen technology development.[19] By 2017, however, Daimler had abandoned hydrogen vehicle development,[20] and most of the automobile companies developing hydrogen cars had switched their focus to battery electric vehicles.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFuel-cell buses (as opposed to hydrogen fueled buses) are being trialed by several manufacturers in different locations, for example, Ursus Lublin. The Fuel Cell Bus Club is a global fuel cell bus testing collaboration.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world's first hydrogen fuel cell-powered tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. The chief engineer of the CSR subsidiary CSR Sifang Co Ltd., Liang Jianying, said that the company is studying how to reduce the running costs of the tram.[22] Tracks for the new vehicle have been built in seven Chinese cities.

Other manufacturers as Vectrix are working on hydrogen scooters.[24] Finally, hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-hybrid scooters are being made such as the Suzuki Burgman fuel-cell scooter.[25] and the FHybrid.[26] The Burgman received \\"whole vehicle type\\" approval in the EU.[27] The Taiwanese company APFCT conducted a live street test with 80 fuel-cell scooters for Taiwan's Bureau of Energy.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAutostudi S.r.l's H-Due[29] is a hydrogen-powered quad, capable of transporting 1-3 passengers.  A concept for a hydrogen-powered tractor has been proposed.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies such as Boeing, Lange Aviation, and the German Aerospace Center pursue hydrogen as fuel for manned and unmanned airplanes. In February 2008 Boeing tested a manned flight of a small aircraft powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. Unmanned hydrogen planes have also been tested.[31] For large passenger airplanes, The Times reported that \\"Boeing said that hydrogen fuel cells were unlikely to power the engines of large passenger jet airplanes but could be used as backup or auxiliary power units onboard.\\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2010, Boeing unveiled its hydrogen-powered Phantom Eye UAV, powered by two Ford internal-combustion engines that have been converted to run on hydrogen.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain, the Reaction Engines A2 has been proposed to use the thermodynamic properties of liquid hydrogen to achieve very high speed, long distance (antipodal) flight by burning it in a precooled jet engine.\\r\\n\\r\\nA HICE forklift or HICE lift truck is a hydrogen fueled, internal combustion engine-powered industrial forklift truck used for lifting and transporting materials.  The first production HICE forklift truck based on the Linde X39 Diesel was presented at an exposition in Hannover on May 27, 2008. It used a 2.0 litre, 43?kW (58?hp) diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and direct injection.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fuel cell forklift (also called a fuel cell lift truck) is a fuel cell powered industrial forklift truck. In 2013 there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in material handling in the US.[36] The global market was estimated at 1 million fuel cell powered forklifts per year for 2014ÿ2016.[37] Fleets are being operated by companies around the world.[38] Pike Research stated in 2011 that fuel-cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost companies in Europe and the US do not use petroleum powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts.[37][40] Fuel-cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery powered forklifts as they can be refueled in 3 minutes. They can be used in refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The fuel cell units are often designed as drop-in replacements.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany large rockets use liquid hydrogen as fuel, with liquid oxygen as an oxidizer (LH2/LOX). An advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high effective exhaust velocity compared to kerosene/LOX or UDMH/NTO engines. According to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, a rocket with higher exhaust velocity uses less propellant to accelerate. Also the energy density of hydrogen is greater than any other fuel.[43] LH2/LOX also yields the greatest efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed, of any known rocket propellant.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nA disadvantage of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly.  Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due to the constant hydrogen boil-off, the rocket must be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for ICBMs and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the delta-v of a hydrogen stage is typically not much different from that of a dense fuelled stage, but the weight of a hydrogen stage is much less, which makes it particularly effective for upper stages, since they are carried by the lower stages. For first stages, dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage, due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nLH2/LOX were also used in the Space Shuttle to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems.[46] The byproduct of the fuel cell is water, which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016 Nikola Motor Company introduced a hydrogen-powered Class 8 heavy truck powered by a 320 kWh EV battery. Nikola plans two versions of the hydrogen powered truck, long haul Nikola One and day cab Nikola Two.[47] United Parcel Service began testing of a hydrogen powered delivery vehicle in 2017.[48] US Hybrid, Toyota, and Kenworth have also announced plans to test Class 8 drayage hydrogen fuel cell trucks.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen internal combustion engine cars are different from hydrogen fuel cell cars. The hydrogen internal combustion car is a slightly modified version of the traditional gasoline internal combustion engine car. These hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do; the main difference is the exhaust product. Gasoline combustion results in carbon dioxide and water vapor, while the only exhaust product of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1807 Francois Isaac de Rivaz designed the first hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine.[50] In 1965, Roger Billings, then a high school student, converted a Model A to run on hydrogen.[51] In 1970 Paul Dieges patented a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen US 3844262?.\\r\\n\\r\\nMazda has developed Wankel engines burning hydrogen.[citation needed] The advantage of using an internal combustion engine, like Wankel and piston engines, is the lower cost of retooling for production.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHICE forklift trucks have been demonstrated[52] based on converted diesel internal combustion engines with direct injection.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen fuel cells are relatively expensive to produce, as their designs require rare substances such as platinum as a catalyst,[53] In 2014, Toyota said it would introduce its Toyota Mirai in Japan for less than $70,000 in 2015.[12][54] Former European Parliament President Pat Cox estimates that Toyota will initially lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problems in early fuel-cell designs at low temperatures concerning range and cold start capabilities have been addressed so that they \\"cannot be seen as show-stoppers anymore\\".[55] Users in 2014 said that their fuel cell vehicles perform flawlessly in temperatures below zero, even with the heaters blasting, without significantly reducing range.[56] Studies using neutron radiography on unassisted cold-start indicate ice formation in the cathode,[57] three stages in cold start[58] and Nafion ionic conductivity.[59] A parameter, defined as coulomb of charge, was also defined to measure cold start capability.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service life of fuel cells is comparable to that of other vehicles.[61]  PEM service life is 7,300 hours under cycling conditions.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen does not come as a pre-existing source of energy like fossil fuels but is first produced and then stored as a carrier,[63] much like a battery.  A suggested benefit of large-scale deployment of hydrogen vehicles is that it could lead to decreased emissions of greenhouse gasses and ozone precursors.[64] However, as of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from methane. It can be produced using renewable sources, but that is an expensive process.[3][65] Integrated wind-to-hydrogen (power to gas) plants, using electrolysis of water, are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with traditional energy sources.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Ford Motor Company, \\"when FCVs are run on hydrogen reformed from natural gas using this process, they do not provide significant environmental benefits on a well-to-wheels basis (due to GHG emissions from the natural gas reformation process).\\"[67] While methods of hydrogen production that do not use fossil fuel would be more sustainable,[68] currently renewable energy represents only a small percentage of energy generated, and power produced from renewable sources can be used in electric vehicles and for non-vehicle applications.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe challenges facing the use of hydrogen in vehicles include production, storage, transport, and distribution. The well-to-wheel efficiency for hydrogen is less than 25%.[7][70][71][72] More recent analyses confirm this.[73][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe molecular hydrogen needed as an onboard fuel for hydrogen vehicles can be obtained through many thermochemical methods utilizing natural gas, coal (by a process known as coal gasification), liquefied petroleum gas, biomass (biomass gasification), by a process called thermolysis, or as a microbial waste product called biohydrogen or Biological hydrogen production. 95% of hydrogen is produced using natural gas,[75] and 85% of hydrogen produced is used to remove sulfur from gasoline. Hydrogen can also be produced from water by electrolysis at working efficiencies in the 50ÿ60% range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65ÿ70% for the larger plants.[76] Hydrogen can also be made by chemical reduction using chemical hydrides or aluminum.[77]  Current technologies for manufacturing hydrogen use energy in various forms, totaling between 25 and 50 percent of the higher heating value of the hydrogen fuel, used to produce, compress or liquefy, and transmit the hydrogen by pipeline or truck.,[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironmental consequences of the production of hydrogen from fossil energy resources include the emission of greenhouse gasses, a consequence that would also result from the on-board reforming of methanol into hydrogen.[70] Analyses comparing the environmental consequences of hydrogen production and use in fuel-cell vehicles to the refining of petroleum and combustion in conventional automobile engines do not agree on whether a net reduction of ozone and greenhouse gasses would result.[7][64] Hydrogen production using renewable energy resources would not create such emissions, but the scale of renewable energy production would need to be expanded to be used in producing hydrogen for a significant part of transportation needs.[78] As of 2016, 14.9 percent of U.S. electricity was produced from renewable sources.[79] In a few countries, renewable sources are being used more widely to produce energy and hydrogen. For example, Iceland is using geothermal power to produce hydrogen,[80] and Denmark is using wind.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen has a very low volumetric energy density at ambient conditions, equal to about one-third that of methane. Even when the fuel is stored as liquid hydrogen in a cryogenic tank or in a compressed hydrogen storage tank, the volumetric energy density (megajoules per liter) is small relative to that of gasoline.[16][17][18][53] Hydrogen has three times higher specific energy by mass compared to gasoline (143 MJ/kg versus 46.9 MJ/kg).  In 2011, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory and University of Alabama, working with the U.S. Department of Energy, found a single-stage method for recharging ammonia borane, a hydrogen storage compound.[83][84] In 2018, researchers at CSIRO in Australia powered a Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo with hydrogen separated from ammonia using a membrane technology. Ammonia is easier to transport safely in tankers than pure hydrogen.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hydrogen infrastructure consists mainly of industrial hydrogen pipeline transport and hydrogen-equipped filling stations like those found on a hydrogen highway. Hydrogen stations which are not situated near a hydrogen pipeline can obtain supply via hydrogen tanks, compressed hydrogen tube trailers, liquid hydrogen tank trucks or dedicated onsite production.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to GM, 70% of the U.S. population lives near a hydrogen-generating facility but has little access to hydrogen, despite its wide availability for commercial use.[86] The distribution of hydrogen fuel for vehicles throughout the U.S. would require new hydrogen stations that would cost, by some estimates approximately 20 billion dollars[87] and 4.6 billion in the EU.[88]  Other estimates place the cost in the United States as high as half trillion dollars.[7][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], there were 23 publicly accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the USA, 20 of which were located in California.[90][91] By May 2017, there were 91 hydrogen fueling stations in Japan.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen codes and standards, as well as codes and technical standards for hydrogen safety and the storage of hydrogen, have been identified as an institutional barrier to deploying hydrogen technologies and developing a hydrogen economy. To enable the commercialization of hydrogen in consumer products, new codes and standards must be developed and adopted by federal, state and local governments.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, George W. Bush announced an initiative to promote hydrogen powered vehicles.[94] In 2009, President Obama and his Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu stripped the funding of fuel cell technology due to their belief that the technology was still decades away. Under heavy criticism, the funding was partially restored.[95][96] In 2014 the Obama administration announced they want to speed up production and development of hydrogen powered vehicles.  The Department of Energy planned to spread a $7.2 million investment among the states of Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee to support projects that fuel vehicles and support power systems. The Center for Transportation and The Environment, Fed Ex Express, Air Products and Chemicals, and Sprint have invested in the development of fuel cells. Fuel cells could also be used in handling equipment such as forklifts as well as telecommunications infrastructure.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nSenator Byron L. Dorgan stated in 2013: The Energy and Water Appropriations bill makes investments in our nations efforts to develop safe, homegrown energy sources that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil. And, because ongoing research and development is necessary to develop game-changing technologies, this bill also restores funding for Hydrogen energy research. In June 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy gave 9 million dollars in grants to speed up technology development, 4.5 million for advanced fuel cell membranes, $3 million to 3M corporation to work on membranes with improved durability and performance, and 1.5 million to the Colorado School of Mines for work on simpler and more affordable fuel cell membranes.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japan, hydrogen is mainly to be sourced from outside Japan.[63][99]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorway plans a series of hydrogen refueling stations along the main roads.[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics claim the time frame for overcoming the technical and economic challenges to implementing wide-scale use of hydrogen cars is likely to last for at least several decades, and hydrogen vehicles may never become broadly available.[69][102]  They claim that the focus on the use of the hydrogen car is a dangerous detour from more readily available solutions to reducing the use of fossil fuels in vehicles.[103]  In May 2008, Wired News reported that \\"experts say it will be 40 years or more before hydrogen has any meaningful impact on gasoline consumption or global warming, and we can't afford to wait that long.  In the meantime, fuel cells are diverting resources from more immediate solutions.\\"[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritiques of hydrogen vehicles are presented in the 2006 documentary, Who Killed the Electric Car?.  According to former U.S. Department of Energy official Joseph Romm, \\"A hydrogen car is one of the least efficient, most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases.\\" Asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available, Romm replied: \\"Not in our lifetime, and very possibly never.\\"[105]  The Los Angeles Times wrote, in 2009, \\"Hydrogen fuel-cell technology won't work in cars. ... Any way you look at it, hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars.\\"[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economist magazine, in 2008, quoted Robert Zubrin, the author of Energy Victory, as saying: \\"Hydrogen is 'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel'\\".[107]  The magazine noted the withdrawal of California from earlier goals: \\"In [2008] the California Air Resources Board, an agency of California's state government and a bellwether for state governments across America, changed its requirement for the number of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to be built and sold in California between 2012 and 2014. The revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles.\\"[107] The magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation, which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today's gasoline cars. On the other hand, if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, \\"it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.\\"[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2009 study at UC Davis, published in the Journal of Power Sources, similarly found that, over their lifetimes, hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.[108] This agrees with a 2014 analysis.[7] The Washington Post asked in 2009, \\"[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries\\"?[75] The Motley Fool stated in 2013 that \\"there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production.\\"[109]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVolkswagen's Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that \\"no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity.\\" He elaborated: \\"Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy\\", but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen \\"with low efficiencies\\" where \\"you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy\\". You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. \\"And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss\\". Krebs continued: \\"in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent.\\"[110] The Business Insider commented: \\r\\nPure hydrogen can be industrially derived, but it takes energy. If that energy does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure. Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before FCEVs [fuel cell electric vehicles] become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are \\"still very, very expensive\\".[111]\\r\\nIn 2014, Joseph Romm devoted three articles to updating his critiques of hydrogen vehicles. He stated that fuel cell vehicles still have not overcome the following issues: high cost of the vehicles, high fueling cost, and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure. \\"It would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades.\\"[112] Moreover, he wrote, \\"FCVs aren't green\\" because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced, as 95% of it is, using the steam reforming process. He concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet \\"either now or in the future.\\"[113] GreenTech Media's analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014.[114] In 2015, Clean Technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles[115] as did Car Throttle.[116] Another Clean Technica writer concluded that \\"while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage (especially seasonal storage), it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles.\\"[117] A 2016 study in the November issue of the journal Energy by scientists at Stanford University and the Technical University of Munich concluded that, even assuming local hydrogen production, \\"investing in all-electric battery vehicles is a more economical choice for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, primarily due to their lower cost and significantly higher energy efficiency.\\"[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2017 analysis published in Green Car Reports concluded that the best hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles consume \\"more than three times more electricity per mile than an electric vehicle ... generate more greenhouse-gas emissions than other powertrain technologies ... [and have] very high fuel costs. ... Considering all the obstacles and requirements for new infrastructure (estimated to cost as much as $400 billion), fuel-cell vehicles seem likely to be a niche technology at best, with little impact on U.S. oil consumption.[92] The US Department of Energy agrees, for fuel produced by grid electricity via electrolysis, but not for most other pathways for generation.[119] Argonne National Laboratory developed a model of these emission pathways, to communicate the impact of potential fuel cell vehicle advantages and disadvantages.[120] In 2017, Michael Barnard, writing in Forbes, listed the continuing disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell cars and concluded that \\"by about 2008, it was very clear that hydrogen was and would be inferior to battery technology as a storage of energy for vehicles. [B]y 2025 the last hold-outs should likely be retiring their fuel cell dreams.\\"[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen vehicles compete with various proposed alternatives to the modern fossil fuel powered vehicle infrastructure.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs, are hybrid vehicles that can be plugged into the electric grid and contain an electric motor and also an internal combustion engine. The PHEV concept augments standard hybrid electric vehicles with the ability to recharge their batteries from an external source, enabling increased use of the vehicle's electric motors while reducing their reliance on internal combustion engines. The infrastructure required to charge PHEVs is already in place,[122] and transmission of power from grid to car is about 93% efficient.[123] This, however, is not the only energy loss in transferring power from grid to wheels. AC/DC conversion must take place from the grids AC supply to the PHEV's DC. This is roughly 98% efficient.[124] The battery then must be charged. As of 2007, the Lithium iron phosphate battery was between 80-90% efficient in charging/discharging.[125] The battery needs to be cooled; the GM Volt's battery has 4 coolers and two radiators.[126] As of 2009, \\"the total well-to-wheels efficiency with which a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might utilize renewable electricity is roughly 20% (although that number could rise to 25% or a little higher with the kind of multiple technology breakthroughs required to enable a hydrogen economy). The well-to-wheels efficiency of charging an onboard battery and then discharging it to run an electric motor in a PHEV or EV, however, is 80% (and could be higher in the future)four times more efficient than current hydrogen fuel cell vehicle pathways.\\"[72]  A 2006 article in Scientific American argued that PHEVs, rather than hydrogen vehicles, would become standard in the automobile industry.[127][128]  A December 2009 study at UC Davis found that, over their lifetimes, PHEVs will emit less carbon than current vehicles, while hydrogen cars will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nInternal combustion engine-based compressed natural gas(CNG), HCNG or LNG vehicles (Natural gas vehicles or NGVs) use methane (Natural gas or Biogas) directly as a fuel source. Natural gas has a higher energy density than hydrogen gas. NGVs using biogas are nearly carbon neutral.[129] Unlike hydrogen vehicles, CNG vehicles have been available for many years, and there is sufficient infrastructure to provide both commercial and home refueling stations. Worldwide, there were 14.8 million natural gas vehicles by the end of 2011.[130] The other use for natural gas is in steam reforming which is the common way to produce hydrogen gas for use in electric cars with fuel cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2008 Technology Review article stated, \\"Electric carsand plug-in hybrid carshave an enormous advantage over hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in utilizing low-carbon electricity.  That is because of the inherent inefficiency of the entire hydrogen fueling process, from generating the hydrogen with that electricity to transporting this diffuse gas long distances, getting the hydrogen in the car, and then running it through a fuel cellall for the purpose of converting the hydrogen back into electricity to drive the same exact electric motor you'll find in an electric car.\\"[131]  Thermodynamically, each additional step in the conversion process decreases the overall efficiency of the process.[132][133]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2013 comparison of hydrogen and battery electric vehicles agreed with the 25% figure from Ulf Bossel in 2006 and stated that the cost of an electric vehicle battery \\"is rapidly coming down, and the gap will widen further\\", while there is little \\"existing infrastructure to transport, store and deliver hydrogen to vehicles and would cost billions of dollars to put into place, everyone's household power sockets are \\"electric vehicle refueling\\" station and the \\"cost of electricity (depending on the source) is at least 75% cheaper than hydrogen.\\"[134] In 2013 the National Academy of Sciences[135] and DOE stated that even under optimistic conditions by 2030 the price for the battery is not expected to go below $17,000 ($200ÿ$250/kWh) on 300 miles of range.[136] In 2013 Matthew Mench, from the University of Tennessee stated: \\"If we are sitting around waiting for a battery breakthrough that will give us four times the range than we have now, we are going to be waiting for a long time\\".[137] Navigant Research, (formerly Pike research), on the other hand, forecasts that lithium-ion costs, which are tipping the scales at about $500 per kilowatt hour now, could fall to $300 by 2015 and to $180 by 2020.[138] In 2013 Takeshi Uchiyamada, a designer of the Toyota Prius stated: \\"Because of its shortcomings ÿ driving range, cost and recharging time ÿ the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars\\".[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany electric car designs offer limited driving range causing range anxiety. For example, the 2013 Nissan Leaf has a range of 75?mi (121?km),[140] the 2014 Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive has an estimated range of 115?mi (185?km)[141] and the Tesla Model S has a range of up to 335?mi (539?km).[142] However, most US commutes are 30ÿ40 miles (48ÿ64?km) per day round trip[143] and in Europe, most commutes are around 20 kilometres (12?mi) round-trip[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, The New York Times stated that there are only 10 publicly accessible hydrogen-filling stations in the U.S., eight of which are in Southern California, and that BEVs' cost-per-mile expense in 2013 is one-third as much as hydrogen cars when comparing electricity from the grid and hydrogen at a filling station. The Times commented: \\"By the time Toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan, there will be about half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the United States ÿ and tens of thousands of E.V. charging stations.\\"[5] In 2013 John Swanton of the California Air Resources Board, who sees them as complementary technologies, stated that EVs have the jump on fuel-cell autos, which \\"are like electric vehicles were 10 years ago. EVs are for real consumers, no strings attached. With EVs you have a lot of infrastructure in place.[145] The Business Insider, in 2013 commented that if the energy to produce hydrogen \\"does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before FCEVs become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are \\"still very, very expensive\\", even compared to battery-powered EVs.[111]","input":"When was the hydrogen fuel cell car invented?"},{"output":"September 2008","context":"The federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was the placing into conservatorship of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) by the U.S. Treasury in September 2008.

The two GSEs had outstanding more than US$5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt; the debt portion alone was $1.6 trillion.[6] The conservatorship action has been described as \\"one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades\\",[7] and one that \\"could turn into the biggest and costliest government bailout ever of private companies\\".[8]\\r\\nWith a growing sense of crisis in U.S. financial markets, the conservatorship action and commitment by the U.S. government to backstop the two GSEs with up to US$200 billion in additional capital turned out to be the first significant event in a tumultuous month among U.S.-based investment banking, financial institutions and federal regulatory bodies.[according to whom?] By September 15, 2008, the 158-year-old Lehman Brothers holding company filed for bankruptcy with intent to liquidate its assets, leaving its financially sound subsidiaries operational and outside of the bankruptcy filing. The collapse was the largest investment bank failure since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990.[9][10] The 94-year-old Merrill Lynch accepted a purchase offer by Bank of America for approximately US$50 billion, a big drop from a year-earlier market valuation of about US$100 billion. A credit rating downgrade of the large insurer American International Group (AIG) led to a September 16, 2008 rescue agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank for a US$85 billion secured loan facility, in exchange for warrants for 79.9% of the equity of AIG.[11][12][13][14]\\r\\nThe GSE business model has outperformed any other real estate business throughout its existence.

Losses were disproportionately worse during the crisis years, 2008 through 2011, when Fannie's average annual loss rate was 52 basis points. Freddie Mac's results are comparable.\\r\\nBy way of contrast, during 1991ÿ2007, commercial banks' average annual loss rate on single-family mortgages was about 15 basis points.[16] During 2008ÿ2011, annual losses were 184 basis points.\\r\\nThe FHFA study[17] compares, on an apples-to-apples basis, GSEs loan originations with those for private label securitizations. The study segments loans four ways, by adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)-versus-fixed-rate, as well as by vintage, by FICO score and by loan-to-value ratio. In almost every one of 1800 different comparisons covering years 2001 through 2008, GSE loan performance was exponentially better.[clarification needed] On average, GSE fixed-rate loans performed four times better, and GSE ARMs performed five times better.\\r\\nHowever, other critics in D.C.[who?] claim that the GSE business model faces inherent conflicts due to its combination of government mission and private ownership. The GSEs were given monopoly privileges against which private enterprise could not compete. Both GSEs had a line of credit with the US Treasury Department, and both GSEs were exempt from state and local income tax on corporate earnings. The GSEs were the only two Fortune 500 companies exempt from regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of implicit government backing, Fannie Mae discount notes became the second-largest short-term notes issued (second only to Treasury bills).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank, argues that \\"the government mission required them to keep mortgage interest rates low and to increase their support for affordable housing. Their shareholder ownership, however, required them to fight increases in their capital requirements and regulation that would raise their costs and reduce their risk-taking and profitability. But there were two other partiesCongress and the taxpayersthat also had a stake in the choices that Fannie and Freddie made. Congress got some benefits in the form of political support from the GSEs' ability to hold down mortgage rates, but it garnered even more political benefits from GSE support for affordable housing.\\"[18] However, such claims were at odds with the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Bush Administration sought to create a new agency, replacing the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 1992 in the wake of the savings and loan crisis, and over concern similar lending problems would develop, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight was created as part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.[19] While Senate and House leaders voiced their intention to bring about the needed legislation, no reform bills materialized. A Senate reform bill introduced by Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ) (S.1656[20]) never made it out of the 21-member (10 D, 11 R) Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.[21] At the time, some members of the 108th congress expressed faith in the solvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA), for example, described them as \\"not facing any kind of financial crisis\\".[22]\\r\\nIn 2005, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act,[23] sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and co-sponsored by Senators Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), John McCain (R-AZ) and John Sununu (R-NH),[24] would have increased government oversight of loans given by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Like the 2003 bill, it also died in the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, this time in the 109th Congress. A full and accurate record of the congressional attempts to regulate the housing GSEs is given in the Congressional Record prepared in 2005.[25][26]\\r\\nThe Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008passed by the United States Congress on July 24, 2008 with bipartisan support and signed into law by President George W. Bush on July 30, 2008  enabled expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the newly established FHFA, and gave the U.S. Treasury the authority to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The law raised the Treasury's debt ceiling by US$800 billion, to a total of US$10.7 trillion, in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Banks.[27][28][29]\\r\\nThe September 7 conservatorship was termed by The Economist as the \\"second\\" bailout of the GSEs.[30] Prior to the enactment of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, on July 13, 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced an effort to backstop the GSEs based on prior statutory authority, in coordination with the Federal Reserve Bank. That announcement occurred after a week in which the market values of shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell almost by half (from a previously diminished value of approximately half of year-earlier market highs).[31] That plan contained three measures: an increase in the line of credit available to the GSEs from the Treasury, to provide liquidity; the right for the Treasury to purchase equity in the GSEs, to provide capital; and a consultative role for the Federal Reserve in a reformed GSE regulatory system.[32] On the same day, the Federal Reserve announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would have the right to lend to the GSEs as necessary.[33]\\r\\nThe agreement the Treasury made with both GSEs specifies that in exchange for future support and capital investments of up to US$100 billion in each GSE, at the inception of the conservatorship, each GSE shall issue to the Treasury US$1?billion of senior preferred stock, with a 10% coupon, without cost to the Treasury.[6][34] Also, each GSE contracted to issue common stock warrants representing an ownership stake of 79.9%, at an exercise price of one-thousandth of a U.S. cent ($0.00001) per share, and with a warrant duration of twenty years.[35]\\r\\nThe conservator, FHFA signed the agreements on behalf of the GSEs.[35] The 100 billion amount for each GSE was chosen to indicate the level of commitment that the U.S. Treasury is willing to make to keep the financial operations and financial conditions solvent and sustainable for both GSEs. The agreements were designed to protect the senior and subordinated debt and the mortgage backed securities of the GSEs. The GSEs' common stock and existing preferred shareholders will bear any losses ahead of the government. Among other conditions of the agreement, each GSEs retained mortgage and mortgage backed securities portfolio shall not exceed $850 billion as of December 31, 2009, and shall decline by 10% per year until it reaches $250 billion.[36]\\r\\nIn the September 6, 2008 conservatorship announcement, Lockhart indicated the following items in the plan of action for the Federal Housing Finance Agency conservatorship:[2]\\r\\nIn addition to the government conservatorship, which CBO estimates will increase the federal government's net liabilities by $238 billion, several government agencies have taken steps to increase liquidity within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Among these steps includes:[38]\\r\\nThe on- or off-balance sheet obligations of the two GSEs, which are \\"independent\\" corporations rather than federal agencies, are just over $5 trillion, a significant amount when compared to the $9.5 trillion of officially reported United States public debt at the time of the takeover.[39] The September 6, 2008 conservatorship and the subsequent planned Treasury infusion of capital support the senior liabilities, subordinated indebtedness, and mortgage guarantees of the two firms. Some observers see this as an effective nationalization of the companies that ultimately places taxpayers at risk for all their liabilities.[40] The federal government follows specialized accounting standards set by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. The net exposure to taxpayers is difficult to determine at the time of the takeover and depends on several factors, such as declines in housing prices and losses on mortgage assets in the future.[41] The Congressional Budget Office director Peter R. Orszag announced on September 9, 2008 that the CBO intended to incorporate the assets and liabilities of the two companies into their federal budget planning, due to the degree of government control over the entities.[6][42] The White House Budget Director Jim Nussle, on September 12, 2008 indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the GSE debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the conservator intervention.[42]\\r\\nBloomberg reported that according to CMA Datavision of London that \\"five-year credit-default swap contracts on U.S. government debt increased 3.5 basis points on September 9, 2008 to a record 18, up from 6 basis points in April,\\" in reaction to concerns about the potential rise in U.S. debt from bailouts.[6]\\r\\nOn May 8, 2013, Representatives Scott Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, if it were passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[43] The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.[43] The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.[44] These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.[45]\\r\\nMany commercial banks in the United States own Freddie and Fannie preferred shares. Those shares have had their dividends suspended, and are junior to the senior preferred stock issued to the Treasury in the restructuring of the two companies. The market value of the preferred shares plunged after the restructuring announcement and suspension of dividends. Banks were required to write down the value of Freddie and Fannie preferred stock held in their portfolios, compounding capitalization concerns for certain U.S. banks.[46] Gateway bank agreed to be bought out by Hampton Roads Bankshares Inc. to make up for a writedown of $40 million on its stock in Fannie and Freddie, which put it below regulatory requirements to be considered adequately capitalized.[47]\\r\\nIn the credit default swap (CDS) market, the standard contracts typically used between parties to a swap define the action of placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship to be equivalent to bankruptcy, because of the change in management control. In CDS parlance, this is termed a credit event, and that triggers the settling of outstanding contracts for the derivatives, which are used to hedge or speculate on the potential risk that a company will default on its bonds. The two GSEs have approximately US$1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding, and since the market in credit default swaps is not public, there is no central reporting mechanism to verify how many credit default swaps are linked to those bonds. One estimate floated is US$500 billion, and that the entire CDS market has a notional value in the vicinity of US$62 trillion.[48][49] Settlement on the contracts, will likely be the largest in the market's decade-long history.[49] Credit-default swaps on Fannie and Freddie have been among the most actively traded the several months leading up to the conservatorship. \\"Thirteen 'major' dealers of credit-default swaps agreed 'unanimously' that the rescue constitutes a credit event triggering payment or delivery of the companies' bonds,\\" according to a memo circulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) after the conservatorship announcement.[50] The day after the conservatorship announcement, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which sets industry standardized contracts for financial derivatives and swaps, announced it was working on a protocol on how to evaluate and settle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit default swaps.[51] Most of these swaps were settled on October 6, 2008.[52]\\r\\nParadoxically (in relation to typical experiences when a company issuing bonds has a \\"credit event\\"), the value of the two GSEs bonds rose to the vicinity of par value after the conservatorship. This means, that some owners of swaps that were hedging against the risk of a bond default, may be worse off, since the value of the bonds may be higher than when they purchased the swap. Cash auctions are reported to be scheduled for October 2008 to settle CDS contracts in relation to the GSEs.[48][53]\\r\\nThe immediate reactions in the finance markets on Monday September 8, the day following the seizure, appeared to indicate satisfaction with at least the short-term implications of the Treasury's intervention. Governor of the Bank of Japan Masaaki Shirakawa stated \\"We expect the action would lead to stabilize the U.S. [mortgage-backed securities] market, financial market and the international financial market.\\" Governor of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan stated \\"From my point of view this is positive\\".[54]\\r\\nThe effects on the subprime mortgage crisis have led the government to support the soundness of the obligations and guarantees on securities issued by Fannie and Freddie to obtain funds. Those funds are in turn used to purchase mortgages from originating banks. The continuing soundness of GSE obligations enhances market liquidity (loanable funds) in the following ways:[55]\\r\\nOver 98% of Fannie's loans were paying timely during 2008.[58] Both Fannie and Freddie had positive net worth as of the date of the takeover, meaning the value of their assets exceeded their liabilities. However, Fannie's total assets to capital (leverage ratio) was about 20:1, while Freddie's was about 70:1.[59][60] These numbers increase significantly if one includes all the mortgage-backed assets they guaranteed. These ratios are considerably higher than investment banks, which leverage around 30:1.[61][62]\\r\\nHowever, there was concern[according to whom?] that the GSEs' liquidity was insufficient to handle growing delinquency rates, such that although viable in September 2008, the scale of loss in the future would be sufficient that insolvency would occur and that knowledge of this future failure would induce immediate or near-immediate failure due to buyers refusing to buy debt. Both GSEs roll over large amounts of debt on a quarterly basis and failure to sell debt would lead to failure due to lack of liquidity. A slower form of failure would be the issuing of debt at high cost (to compensate buyers for risk), which would greatly diminish the earning power of both GSEs, rendering them unable to earn the money they would need to handle expected future losses. Both GSEs counted large amounts of deferred tax assets towards their regulatory capital, which were considered by some[who?] to be of \\"low quality\\" and not truly available capital. The deferred tax assets would only have value if the companies were profitable and could use the assets to offset future taxes. Both companies had experienced significant losses and were likely to face more over the next year or longer.[63]\\r\\nIn testimony before a House Financial Services Committee subcommittee on June 3, 2009, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director James B. Lockhart III presented his report, The Present Condition and Future Status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[64] Highlights of the report include the Treasury Department's commitment to fund up to $200 billion in capital for each enterprise is expected be sufficient; the enterprises own or guarantee 56% of the single family mortgages in this country, or $5.4 trillion of the total $11.9 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt; their combined share of mortgages originated in the first quarter of 2009 was 73%; private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLS) are a major driver of Enterprise losses; both Enterprises are heavily involved in planning and implementing the Making Home Affordable and the Home Affordable Refinance programs. The report notes:\\r\\nAs of March 31, 2009, seriously delinquent loans accounted for 2.3% of single-family mortgages owned or guaranteed for Freddie Mac and 3.2% for Fannie Mae. While those are historically high levels, they compare favorably to industry averages of 4.7% for all prime loans, 7.2% for all single-family mortgages, 24.9% for all subprime mortgages, and 36.5% for subprime adjustable rate mortgages\\r\\nThe report provides background on the origins of PLS and the risk they present. PLS loans represent 15% of mortgages but 50% of serious delinquencies. In contrast, at year-end 2008, the loans the enterprises held or guaranteed represented 56% of the U.S. single-family mortgages outstanding, but 20% of serious delinquencies. The credit quality of investments in PLS has proven to be much worse than the initial AAA credit ratings of those securities would have suggested. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the true economic value of PLS will continue to raise safety and soundness concerns.\\r\\nThe report notes the for-profit structure of the GSEs worked counter to prudent risk management as competition reduced both market share and profits, thus eroding the GSEs credit requirements. To maintain profitability, each Enterprise increased purchases of PLS backed by alternative mortgages and of high-risk whole loans. And while many had criticized the OFHEO and sought to replace it:\\r\\nPurchases of PLS ultimately proved disastrous for the Enterprises. Credit and market-value losses would have been even larger had the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), one of FHFAs predecessor agencies, not increased the Enterprises capital requirement by 30% and capped their asset portfolios because of accounting and control problems.\\r\\nThe George W. Bush administration was prevented from taking official action due to Senate Bill 190 of the 109 Congress never being allowed a full Senate vote, even though it was passed out of committee on a 13-9 vote along party lines (13 Republicans voted \\"Yes\\" and 9 Democrats voted \\"No\\"),[65] doing so would have prevented Congress' home ownership goals being realized.\\r\\nOn June 16, 2010, it was announced that the two GSEs would have their shares delisted from the NYSE.[66]\\r\\nAn article from August 2012 in Bloomberg noted that the companies \\"have drawn $190 billion in aid and paid $46 billion in dividends since being taken over by U.S. regulators in 2008\\".[67]\\r\\nCBS News reported on August 6, 2015, that Fannie Mae alone has paid a total of $142.5 billion in dividends since receiving a bailout of $116 billion in 2008.[68]\\r\\nOn September 24, 2012, a judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit that contended that Freddie Mac made misleading statements about its exposure to risky loans in the run-up to the company's federal takeover.[69]\\r\\nOn August 10, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency asked investors for ideas on renting homes owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration.[70]","input":"When did freddie mac and fannie mae fail?"},{"output":"5ÿ20%","context":"Vinegar is a liquid consisting of about 5ÿ20% acetic acid (CH3COOH), water, and other trace chemicals, which may include flavorings. The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria.[1] Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, or in pickling. As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a great variety of industrial, medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household cleaner) are still commonly practiced today.\\r\\nCommercial vinegar is produced either by a fast or a slow fermentation process. In general, slow methods are used in traditional vinegars where fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of a few months or up to a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a non-toxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria. Fast methods add mother of vinegar (bacterial culture) to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced in between 20 hours to three days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversion of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and oxygen (O2) to acetic acid (CH3COOH) takes place by the following reaction:[2]\\r\\nThe word vinegar arrived in Middle English from Old French vyn egre, which in turn derives from Latin vinum (wine) + acer (sour).[3]\\r\\nVinegar has been made and used by people for thousands of years.[4] Traces of it have been found in Egyptian urns from around 3000 BC.[citation needed]\\r\\nSource materials for making vinegar are varied, including different fruits, grains, alcoholic beverages or other fermentable materials.\\r\\nFruit vinegars are made from fruit wines, usually without any additional flavoring. Common flavors of fruit vinegar include apple, blackcurrant, raspberry, quince, and tomato. Typically, the flavors of the original fruits remain in the final product. Most fruit vinegars are produced in Europe, where there is a growing market for high-price vinegars made solely from specific fruits (as opposed to non-fruit vinegars that are infused with fruits or fruit flavors).[5] Several varieties, however, also are produced in Asia. Persimmon vinegar, called gam sikcho, is popular in South Korea. Jujube vinegar, called zaocu or hongzaocu, and wolfberry vinegar are produced in China.\\r\\nApple cider vinegar is made from cider or apple must, and has a brownish-gold color. It is sometimes sold unfiltered and unpasteurized with the mother of vinegar present, as a natural product. It can be diluted with fruit juice or water or sweetened (usually with honey) for consumption.[6]\\r\\nA byproduct of commercial kiwifruit growing is a large amount of waste in the form of misshapen or otherwise-rejected fruit (which may constitute up to 30 percent of the crop) and kiwifruit pomace, the presscake residue left after kiwifruit juice manufacture. One of the uses for this waste is the production of kiwifruit vinegar, produced commercially in New Zealand [7] since at least the early 1990s, and in China in 2008.[8]\\r\\nCoconut vinegar, made from fermented coconut water or sap, is used extensively in Southeast Asian cuisine (notably the Philippines), as well as in some cuisines of India and Sri Lanka, especially Goan cuisine. A cloudy white liquid, it has a particularly sharp, acidic taste with a slightly yeasty note. Vinegar made from dates is a traditional product of the Middle East.[9][10]\\r\\nPomegranate vinegar (Hebrew: ???? ???????) is used widely in Israel as a dress for salad but also in meat stew and in dips.[11] Vinegar made from raisins, called khall ?inab (Arabic: ?? ???? \\"grape vinegar\\") is used in cuisines of the Middle East, and is produced there. It is cloudy and medium brown in color, with a mild flavor.\\r\\nPalm vinegar, made from the fermented sap from flower clusters of the nipa palm (also called attap palm), is used most often in the Philippines, where it is produced, and where it is called sukang paombong. It has a citrusy flavor note to it[12] and imparts a distinctly musky aroma.\\r\\nBalsamic vinegar is an aromatic aged vinegar produced in the Modena and Reggio Emilia provinces of Italy. The original productTraditional Balsamic Vinegaris made from the concentrated juice, or must, of white Trebbiano grapes. It is very dark brown, rich, sweet, and complex, with the finest grades being aged in successive casks made variously of oak, mulberry, chestnut, cherry, juniper, and ash wood. Originally a costly product available to only the Italian upper classes, traditional balsamic vinegar is marked \\"tradizionale\\" or \\"DOC\\" to denote its Protected Designation of Origin status, and is aged for 12 to 25 years. A cheaper non-DOC commercial form described as \\"aceto balsamico di Modena\\" (balsamic vinegar of Modena)[13] became widely known and available around the world in the late 20th century, typically made with concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar, then coloured and slightly sweetened with caramel and sugar.\\r\\nRegardless of how it is produced, balsamic vinegar must be made from a grape product. It contains no balsam fruit. A high acidity level is somewhat hidden by the sweetness of the other ingredients, making it very mellow.\\r\\nVinegar made from sugarcane juice is most popular in the Philippines, in particular in the northern Ilocos Region (where it is called Sukang Iloko), although it also is produced in France and the United States. It ranges from dark yellow to golden brown in color, and has a mellow flavor, similar in some respects to rice vinegar, though with a somewhat \\"fresher\\" taste. Because it contains no residual sugar, it is no sweeter than any other vinegar. In the Philippines it often is labeled as sukang maasim (Tagalog for \\"sour vinegar\\").\\r\\nCane vinegars from Ilocos are made in two different ways. One way is to simply place sugar cane juice in large jars; it becomes sour by the direct action of bacteria on the sugar. The other way is through fermentation to produce a local wine known as basi. Low-quality basi is then allowed to undergo acetic acid fermentation that converts alcohol into acetic acid. Contaminated basi also becomes vinegar.\\r\\nA white variation has become quite popular in Brazil in recent years, where it is the cheapest type of vinegar sold. It is now common for other types of vinegar (made from wine, rice and apple cider) to be sold mixed with cane vinegar to lower the cost.[citation needed]\\r\\nSugarcane sirka is made from sugarcane juice in Punjab, India. During summer people put cane juice in earthenware pots with iron nails. The fermentation takes place due to the action of wild yeast. The cane juice is converted to vinegar having a blackish color. The sirka is used to preserve pickles and for flavoring curries.\\r\\nChinese black vinegar is an aged product made from rice, wheat, millet, sorghum, or a combination thereof. It has an inky black color and a complex, malty flavor. There is no fixed recipe, so some Chinese black vinegars may contain added sugar, spices, or caramel color. The most popular variety, Zhenjiang vinegar, originates in the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province, eastern China.[14] Shanxi mature vinegar is another popular type of Chinese vinegar that is made exclusively from sorghum and other grains. Nowadays in Shanxi province, there are still some traditional vinegar workshops producing handmade vinegar which is aged for at least five years with a high acidity. Only the vinegar made in Taiyuan and some counties in Jinzhong and aged for at least three years is considered authentic Shanxi mature vinegar according to the latest national standard. A somewhat lighter form of black vinegar, made from rice, is produced in Japan, where it is called kurozu.\\r\\nRice vinegar is most popular in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia. It is available in \\"white\\" (light yellow), red, and black varieties. The Japanese prefer a light rice vinegar for the preparation of sushi rice and salad dressings. Red rice vinegar traditionally is colored with red yeast rice. Black rice vinegar (made with black glutinous rice) is most popular in China, and it is also widely used in other East Asian countries. White rice vinegar has a mild acidity with a somewhat \\"flat\\" and uncomplex flavor. Some varieties of rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned with spices or other added flavorings.\\r\\nMalt vinegar made from ale, also called alegar[15], is made by malting barley, causing the starch in the grain to turn to maltose. Then an ale is brewed from the maltose and allowed to turn into vinegar, which is then aged.[15] It is typically light-brown in color. In the United Kingdom and Canada, malt vinegar (along with salt) is a traditional seasoning for fish and chips. Some fish and chip shops replace it with non-brewed condiment.\\r\\nAccording to Canadian regulations, malt vinegar is defined as a vinegar that includes undistilled malt that has not yet undergone acetous fermentation. It must be dextro-rotary and cannot contain less than 1.8 grams of solids and 0.2 grams of ash per 100 millilitres at 20 degrees Celsius. It may contain additional cereals or caramel.[16]\\r\\nThe term spirit vinegar is sometimes reserved for the stronger variety (5% to 21% acetic acid) made from sugar cane or from chemically produced acetic acid.[17] To be called \\"Spirit Vinegar\\", the product must come from an agricultural source and must be made by \\"double fermentation\\". The first fermentation is sugar to alcohol and the second alcohol to acetic acid. Product made from chemically produced acetic acid cannot be called \\"vinegar\\". In the UK the term allowed is \\"Non-brewed condiment\\".\\r\\nSherry vinegar is linked to the production of sherry wines of Jerez. Dark mahogany in color, it is made exclusively from the acetic fermentation of wines. It is concentrated and has generous aromas, including a note of wood, ideal for vinaigrettes and flavoring various foods. Wine vinegar is made from red or white wine, and is the most commonly used vinegar in Southern and Central Europe, Cyprus and Israel. As with wine, there is a considerable range in quality. Better-quality wine vinegars are matured in wood for up to two years, and exhibit a complex, mellow flavor. Wine vinegar tends to have a lower acidity than white or cider vinegars. More expensive wine vinegars are made from individual varieties of wine, such as champagne, sherry, or pinot gris.\\r\\nThe term \\"distilled vinegar\\" as used in the United States (called \\"spirit vinegar\\" in the UK, \\"white vinegar\\" in Canada[18]) is something of a misnomer because it is not produced by distillation but by fermentation of distilled alcohol. The fermentate is diluted to produce a colorless solution of 5% to 8% acetic acid in water, with a pH of about 2.6. This is variously known as distilled spirit, \\"virgin\\" vinegar,[19] or white vinegar, and is used in cooking, baking, meat preservation, and pickling, as well as for medicinal, laboratory, and cleaning purposes.[17] The most common starting material in some regions, because of its low cost, is malt,[20] or in the United States, corn. It is sometimes derived from petroleum.[21] Distilled vinegar in the UK is produced by the distillation of malt to give a clear vinegar which maintains some of the malt flavour.[20] Distilled vinegar is used predominantly for cooking, although in Scotland it is used as an alternative to brown or light malt vinegar. White distilled vinegar can also be used for cleaning, and some is actually sold specifically for this purpose.\\r\\nKombucha vinegar is made from kombucha, a symbiotic culture of yeast and bacteria. The bacteria produce a complex array of bacteria. Kombucha vinegar primarily is used to make a vinaigrette, and is flavored by adding strawberries, blackberries, mint, or blueberries at the beginning of fermentation.\\r\\nVinegar is commonly used in food preparation, in particular in pickling processes, vinaigrettes, and other salad dressings. It is an ingredient in sauces such as hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Vinegar is sometimes used while making chutneys. It is often used as a condiment. Marinades often contain vinegar. In terms of its shelf life, vinegar's acidic nature allows it to last indefinitely without the use of refrigeration.[22]\\r\\nSeveral beverages are made using vinegar, for instance Posca. The ancient Greek oxymel is a drink made from vinegar and honey, and sekanjabin is a traditional Persian drink similar to oxymel. Other preparations, known colloquially as \\"shrubs\\", range from simply mixing sugar water or honey water with small amounts of fruity vinegar, to making syrup by laying fruit or mint in vinegar essence for several days, then sieving off solid parts, and adding considerable amounts of sugar. Some prefer to boil the shrub as a final step. These recipes have lost much of their popularity with the rise of carbonated beverages, such as soft drinks.\\r\\nEsophageal injury by apple cider vinegar has been reported, and, because vinegar products sold for medicinal purposes are neither regulated nor standardized, they may vary widely in content and acidity.[23]\\r\\nMany folk medicine treatments have been ascribed to vinegar over millennia, and in many different cultures, although no medical uses are verified by high-quality clinical research.[24] Some folk medicine uses have side effects that represent health risks.[25] Vinegar (as dilute acetic acid) may be useful in cleaning skin wounds.[26]\\r\\nSmall amounts of vinegar (2 to 4 tablespoons) may reduce post-meal levels of blood glucose and insulin in people with and without diabetes.[24][27][28] Some preliminary research indicates that taking vinegar with food increases satiety and reduces the amount of food consumed, producing a loss in body weight, although this effect remains unconfirmed as of 2018.[24]\\r\\nVinegar contains numerous flavonoids, phenolic acids, and aldehydes,[29] which vary in content depending on the source material used to make the vinegar, such as orange peel or various fruit juice concentrates.[30][31]\\r\\nApplying vinegar to common jellyfish stings deactivates the nematocysts, although not as effectively as hot water.[32] This does not apply to the Portuguese man o' war, which, although generally considered to be a jellyfish, is not; vinegar applied to Portuguese man o' war stings can cause their nematocysts to discharge venom, making the pain worse.[33] Vinegar is not effective against lice.[34]\\r\\nWhite vinegar is often used as a household cleaning agent.[35] Because it is acidic, it can dissolve mineral deposits from glass, coffee makers, and other smooth surfaces.[36] For most uses, dilution with water is recommended for safety and to avoid damaging the surfaces being cleaned. Vinegar is an excellent solvent for cleaning epoxy resin and hardener, even after the epoxy has begun to harden. Malt vinegar sprinkled onto crumpled newspaper is a traditional, and still-popular, method of cleaning grease-smeared windows and mirrors in the United Kingdom.[37] Vinegar can be used for polishing brass or bronze. Vinegar is widely known as an effective cleaner of stainless steel and glass.\\r\\nVinegar is effective in removing clogs from drains, polishing silver, copper and brass as well as ungluing sticker-type price tags.[38]\\r\\n20% acetic acid vinegar can be used as an herbicide.[39] Acetic acid is not absorbed into root systems; the vinegar will only kill the top growth and perennial plants may reshoot.[40]\\r\\nMost commercial vinegar solutions available to consumers for household use do not exceed 5%. Solutions above 10% require careful handling, as they are corrosive and damaging to the skin.[41]\\r\\nWhen a bottle of vinegar is opened, mother of vinegar may develop. It is considered harmless and can be removed by filtering.[42]\\r\\nVinegar eels (Turbatrix aceti), a form of nematode, may occur in some forms of vinegar unless the vinegar is kept covered. These feed on the mother of vinegar and can occur in naturally fermenting vinegar.[43]\\r\\nSome countries prohibit the selling of vinegar over a certain percentage acidity. As an example, the government of Canada limits the acetic acid of vinegars to between 4.1% and 12.3%.[44]\\r\\nAccording to legend, in France during the Black Plague, four thieves were able to rob houses of plague victims without being infected themselves. When finally caught, the judge offered to grant the men their freedom, on the condition that they revealed how they managed to stay healthy. They claimed that a medicine woman sold them a potion made of garlic soaked in soured red wine (vinegar). Variants of the recipe, called Four Thieves Vinegar, have been passed down for hundreds of years and are a staple of New Orleans hoodoo practices.[45][46]\\r\\nA solution of vinegar can be used for water slide decal application as used on scale models and musical instruments, among other things. One part white distilled vinegar (5% acidity) diluted with two parts of distilled or filtered water creates a suitable solution for the application of water-slide decals to hard surfaces. The solution is very similar to the commercial products, often described as \\"decal softener\\", sold by hobby shops. The slight acidity of the solution softens the decal and enhances its flexibility, permitting the decal to cling to contours more efficiently.\\r\\nWhen baking soda and vinegar are combined, the bicarbonate ion of the baking soda reacts to form carbonic acid, which decomposes into carbon dioxide and water.[47]\\r\\n Media related to Vinegar at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the percentage of acetic acid in vinegar?"},{"output":"between weeks 4 and 8","context":"An oogonium (plural oogonia) is a small diploid cell which on maturation forms a primordial follicle in a female fetus or the female (haploid or diploid) gametangium of certain thallophytes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOogonia are formed in large numbers by mitosis early in fetal development from primordial germ cells. In humans they start to develop between weeks 4 and 8 and are present in the fetus between weeks 5 and 30.\\r\\nNormal oogonia in human ovaries are spherical or ovoid in shape and are found amongst neighboring somatic cells and oocytes at different phases of development. Oogonia can be distinguished from neighboring somatic cells, under an electron microscope, by observing their nuclei. Oogonial nuclei contain randomly dispersed fibrillar and granular material whereas the somatic cells have a more condensed nucleus that creates a darker outline under the microscope. Oogonial nuclei also contain dense prominent nucleoli. The chromosomal material in the nucleus of mitotically dividing oogonia shows as a dense mass surrounded by vesicles or double membranes.[1]\\r\\nThe cytoplasm of oogonia appears similar to that of the surrounding somatic cells and similarly contains large round mitochondria with lateral cristae. The Endoplasmic Reticulum (E.R.) of oogonia, however, is very underdeveloped and is made up of several small vesicles. Some of these small vesicles contain cisternae with ribosomes and are found located near the golgi apparatus.[1]\\r\\nOogonia that are undergoing degeneration appear slightly different under the electron microscope. In these oogonia, the chromosomes clump together into an indistinguishable mass within the nucleus and the mitochondria and E.R. appear to be swollen and disrupted. Degenerating oogonia are usually found partially or wholly engulfed in neighboring somatic cells, identifying phagocytosis as the mode of elimination.[1]\\r\\nIn the blastocyst of the mammalian embryo, primordial germ cells arise from proximal epiblasts under the influence of extra-embryonic signals. These germ cells then travel, via amoeboid movement, to the genital ridge and eventually into the undifferentiated gonads of the fetus.[2] During the 4th or 5th week of development, the gonads begin to differentiate. In the absence of the Y chromosome, the gonads will differentiate into ovaries. As the ovaries differentiate, ingrowths called cortical cords develop. This is where the primordial germ cells collect.[3][4]\\r\\nDuring the 6th to 8th week of female (XX) embryonic development, the primordial germ cells grow and begin to differentiate into oogonia. Oogonia proliferate via mitosis during the 9th to 22nd week of embryonic development. There can be up to 600,000 oogonia by the 8th week of development and up to 7,000,000 by the 5th month.[3]\\r\\nEventually, the oogonia will either degenerate or further differentiate into primary oocytes through asymmetric division. Asymmetric division is a process of mitosis in which one oogonium divides unequally to produce one daughter cell that will eventually become an oocyte through the process of oogenesis, and one daughter cell that is an identical oogonium to the parent cell. This occurs during the 15th week to the 7th month of embryonic development.[2] Most oogonia have either degenerated or differentiated into primary oocytes by birth.[3][5]\\r\\nPrimary oocytes will undergo oogenesis in which they enter meiosis. However, primary oocytes are arrested in prophase 1 of the first meiosis and remain in that arrested stage until puberty begins in the female adult.[6] This is in contrast to male primordial germ cells which are arrested in the spermatogonial stage at birth and do not enter into spermatogenesis and meiosis to produce primary spermatocytes until puberty in the adult male.[3]\\r\\nThe regulation and differentiation of germ cells into primary gametocytes ultimately depends on the sex of the embryo and the differentiation of the gonads. In female mice, the protein RPSO1 is responsible for the differentiation of female (XX) gonads into ovaries. RSPO1 activates the -catenin signaling pathway by up-regulating Wnt4 which is an essential step in ovary differentiation. Research has shown that ovaries lacking Rspo1 or Wnt4 will exhibit sex reversal of the gonads, the formation of ovotestes and the differentiation of somatic sertoli cells, which aid in the development of sperm.[4]\\r\\nAfter female (XX) germ cells collect in the undifferentiated gonads, the up-regulation of Stra8 is required for germ cell differentiation into an oogonium and eventually enter meiosis. One major factor that contributes to the up-regulation of Stra8, is the initiation of the -Catenin signaling pathway via RSPO1, which is also responsible for ovary differentiation. Since RSPO1 is produced in somatic cells, this protein acts on germ cells in a paracrine mode. Rspo1, however, is not the only factor in Stra8 regulation. Many other factors are under scrutiny and this process is still being evaluated.[4]\\r\\nBecause it is theorized that oogonia either degenerate or differentiate into primary oocytes which enter oogenesis and are halted in prophase I of the first meiosis post partum, it is concluded that adult mammalian females lack a population of germ cells that are able to renew or regenerate. But instead, have a large population of primary oocytes that are arrested in the first meiosis until puberty.[2] At puberty, one primary oocyte will complete meiosis to eventually form an ovum during each menstrual cycle. Because there is an absence of regenerating germ cells and oogonia in the human, the number of primary oocytes dwindles after each menstrual cycle until menopause, when the female no longer has a population of primary oocytes.[2]\\r\\nRecent research, however, has identified that renewable oogonia may be present in the lining of the female ovaries of humans, primates and mice.[2][7][8] It is thought that these germ cell might be necessary for the upkeep of the reproductive follicles and oocyte development, well into adulthood. It has also been discovered, that some stem cells may migrate from the bone marrow to the ovaries as a source of extra-genial germ cells. These mitotically active germ cells found in mammalian adults were identified by tracking several markers that were common in oocytes. These potential renewable germs cells were identified as positive for these essential oocyte markers.[2]\\r\\nThe discovery of these active germ cells and oogonia in the adult female could be very useful in the advancement of fertility research and treatment of infertility.[2][8] Germ cells have been extracted, isolated and grown successfully in vitro.[8] These germ cells have been used to restore fertility in mice by promoting follicle generation and upkeep in previously infertile mice. There is also research being done on possible germ line regeneration in primates. Mitotically active human female germ cells could be very beneficial to a new method of embryonic stem cell development that involves a nuclear transfer into a zygote. Using these functional oogonia may help to create patient-specific stem cells lines using this method.[2]\\r\\nIn phycology and mycology, oogonium refers to a female gametangium if the union of the male (motile or non-motile) and the female gamete takes place within this structure.[9][10]\\r\\nIn Oomycota and some other organisms, the female oogonia, and the male equivalent antheridia, are a result of sexual sporulation, i.e. the development of structures within which meiosis will occur. The haploid nuclei (gametes) are formed by meiosis within the antheridia and oogonia, and when fertilization occurs, a diploid oospore is produced which will eventually germinate into the diploid somatic stage of the thallophyte life cycle.[11]\\r\\nIn many algae (e.g., Chara), the main plant is haploid; oogonia and antheridia form and produce haploid gametes. The only diploid part of the life cycle is the spore (fertilized egg cell), which undergoes meiosis to form haploid cells that develop into new plants. This is a haplontic life cycle (with zygotic meiosis).\\r\\nThe oogonia of certain Thallophyte species are usually round or ovoid, with contents are divided into several uninucleate oospheres. This is in contrast to the male antheridia which are elongate and contain several nuclei.[11]\\r\\nIn heterothallic species, the oogonia and antheridia are located on hyphal branches of different thallophyte colonies. Oogonia of this species can only be fertilized by antheridia from another colony and ensures that self-fertilization is impossible. In contrast, homothallic species display the oogonia and antheridia on either the same hyphal branch or on separate hyphal branches but within the same colony.[11]\\r\\nIn a common mode of fertilization found in certain species of Thallophytes, the antheridia will bind with the oogonia. The antheridia will then form fertilization tubes connecting the antheridial cytoplasm with each oosphere within the oogonia. A haploid nucleus (gamete) from the antheridium will then be transferred through the fertilization tube into the oosphere, and fuse with the oospheres haploid nucleus forming a diploid oospore. The oospore is then ready to germinate and develop into an adult diploid somatic stage.[11]","input":"When are oogonium cells produced in a female?"},{"output":"2 August 1940","context":"\\"񶶳־ Ѿ־ҿ\\"\\r\\n(\\"Moldova Sovietic?\\")\\r\\nMoldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (shortly: Moldavian SSR, abbr.: MSSR; Romanian: Republica Sovietic?

The republic was formed on 2 August 1940 from parts of Bessarabia, a region annexed from Romania on 28 June of that year, and parts of the MASSR, an autonomous republic within the Ukrainian SSR.\\r\\nAfter the Declaration of Sovereignty on 23 June 1990 and until 23 May 1991 it was officially known as the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova. From 23 May 1991 until the declaration of independence on 27 August 1991, it was renamed the Republic of Moldova whilst remaining a constituent republic of the USSR.\\r\\nGeographically, the Moldavian SSR was bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the failure of the Tatarbunar Uprising, the Soviets set up an autonomous Moldavian ASSR on October 12, 1924 within the Ukrainian SSR on part of the territory between the Dniester and Bug rivers, as a way to prop up the propaganda effort and help a potential Communist revolution in Romania.[1]\\r\\nOn August 24, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression treaty, called the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet \\"spheres of influence\\".[2] The secret protocol placed the Romanian province of Bessarabia in the Soviet \\"sphere of influence.\\"[2] Thereafter, both the Soviet Union and Germany invaded their respective portions of Poland,[3] while the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in June 1940,[4][5] and waged war upon Finland (1939ÿ1940).\\r\\nOn June 26, four days after France sued for an armistice with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Romania, demanding the latter to cede Bessarabia and Bukovina.[6] After the Soviets agreed with Germany that they would limit their claims in Bukovina, which was outside the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols, to northern Bukovina, Germany urged Romania to accept the ultimatum, which Romania did two days later.[7] The Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was thereafter created following the entrance of Soviet troops on June 28, 1940.\\r\\nThe old Moldavian ASSR was dismantled and the Moldavian SSR was organized on August 2, 1940 from six full counties and small parts of three other counties of Bessarabia, and the six westernmost rayons of the Moldavian ASSR (about 40% of its territory).[8] 90% of the territory of MSSR was northeast of the river Dniester, which was the border between the USSR and Romania prior to 1940, and 10% southwest. Smaller northern and southern parts of the territories occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940 (the current Chernivtsi Oblast and Budjak), which were more heterogeneous ethnically, were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR, although their population also included 337,000 Moldovans.[8] As such, the strategically important Black Sea coast and Danube frontage were given to the Ukrainian SSR, considered more reliable than the Moldavian SSR, which could have been claimed by Romania.[9]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1941, Romania joined Hitler's Axis in the invasion of the Soviet Union, recovering Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, as well as occupying the territory to the east of the Dniester it dubbed \\"Transnistria\\". By the end of World War II the Soviet Union had reconquered all of the lost territories, reestablishing Soviet authority there.\\r\\nMany Bessarabians who fled to Romania before the advancing Red Army were eventually caught by Soviet security forces; a high percentage of these were shot or deported, blamed as collaborators of Romania and Nazi Germany.[10] On June 22, 1941, during the first day of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, 10 people were killed in R?zeni by Soviet authorities and buried in a mass grave.[11] In July 1941 after Operation Barbarossa, a commemorative plaque was installed in R?zeni: \\"Aici odihnesc robii lui Dumnezeu Diomid, Niculai, D?nila, Nichita, Alexandru, Jurian, Alexandru, Ilie, doi necunoscu?i. Omora?i mi?ele?te de bol?evici comuni?ti. 12.VII.1941\\".[12] A memorial was opened in 2009.\\r\\nThe Soviet authorities targeted several socio-economic groups due to their economic situation, political views, or ties to the former regime. They were deported to or resettled in Siberia and northern Kazakhstan; some were imprisoned or executed. According to a report by the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania, no less than 86,604 people were arrested and deported in 1940-1941 alone. Modern Russian historians put forward an estimative number of 90,000 for the same period.[13] NKVD/MGB also struck at anti-Soviet groups, which were most active in 1944-1952. Anti-Soviet organizations such as Democratic Agrarian Party, Freedom Party, Democratic Union of Freedom, Arca?ii lui ?tefan, Vasile Lupu High School Group, Vocea Basarabiei were severely reprimanded and their leaders were persecuted.[14]\\r\\nA de-kulakisation campaign was directed towards the rich Moldavian peasant families, which were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia as well. For instance, in just two days, July 6 and July 7, 1949, over 11,342 Moldavian families were deported by the order of the Minister of State Security, Iosif Mordovets under a plan named \\"Operation South\\".[10]\\r\\nReligious persecutions during the Soviet occupation targeted numerous priests.[15] After the Soviet occupation, the religious life underwent a persecution similar to the one in Russia between the two World Wars.\\r\\nOther deportation campaigns were directed towards the ethnic Germans (whose number decreased from over 81,000 in 1930 to under 4,000 in 1959 due to voluntary wartime migration and forced removal as collaborators after the war) and religious minorities (700 families, especially Jehovah's Witnesses, were deported to Siberia in April 1951 under the plan \\"Operation North\\").[10]\\r\\nCollectivisation was implemented between 1949 and 1950, although earlier attempts were made since 1946. During this time, a large-scale famine occurred: some sources give a minimum of 115,000 peasants who died of famine and related diseases between December 1946 and August 1947. According to Charles King, there is ample evidence that it was provoked by Soviet requisitioning of large amounts of agricultural products and directed towards the largest ethnic group living in the countryside, the Moldovans. Contributing factors were the recent war, the draught of 1946, and collectivisation.[10]\\r\\nWith the regime of Nikita Khrushchev replacing that of Joseph Stalin, the survivors of Gulag camps and of the deportees were gradually allowed to return to the Moldavian SSR. The political thaw ended the unchecked power of the NKVD/MGB, and the centrally planned economy gave rise to development in the areas such as education, technology and science, health care, and industry (except in the fields that were considered politically sensitive, such as genetics or history).\\r\\nBetween 1969 and 1971, a clandestine National Patriotic Front was established by several young intellectuals in Chi?in?u, totaling over 100 members, vowing to fight for the establishment of a Moldavian Democratic Republic, its secession from the Soviet Union and union with Romania. In December 1971, following an informative note from Ion St?nescu, the President of the Council of State Security of the Romanian Socialist Republic, to Yuri Andropov, the chief of KGB, three of the leaders of the National Patriotic Front, Alexandru Usatiuc-Bulg?r, Gheorghe Ghimpu and Valeriu Graur, as well as a fourth person, Alexandru ?oltoianu, the leader of a similar clandestine movement in northern Bukovina, were arrested and later sentenced to long prison terms.[16]\\r\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Moldavia received substantial investment from the budget of the USSR to develop industrial, scientific facilities, as well as housing. In 1971, the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a decision \\"About the measures for further development of Kishinev (Chi?in?u) city\\" that secured more than one billion rubles of investment from the USSR budget[17] Subsequent decisions directed enormous wealth and brought highly qualified specialists from all over the USSR to develop the Soviet republic. Such an allocation of USSR assets was partially influenced by the fact that Leonid Brezhnev, the effective ruler of the USSR from 1964 to 1982, was the Communist Party First Secretary in the Moldavian SSR in 1950-1952.[citation needed] These alocations stopped in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the nation became independent.\\r\\nAlthough Brezhnev and other CPM first secretaries were largely successful in suppressing Moldavian nationalism, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's administration facilitated the revival of the movement in the region. His policies of glasnost and perestroika created conditions in which national feelings could be openly expressed and in which the Soviet republics could consider reforms independently from the central government.\\r\\nThe MSSR's drive towards independence from the USSR was marked by civil strife as conservative activists in the east (especially in Tiraspol), as well as Communist party activists in Chi?in?u worked to keep the MSSR within the Soviet Union. The main success of the national movement in 1988-1989 was the adoption on August 31, 1989 by the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR of the Moldavian language as official, declaration in the preambule of a Moldavian-Romanian linguistic unity, and the return of the language to the pre-Soviet Latin alphabet.[18] In 1990, when it became clear that Moldavia was eventually going to secede, a group of pro-USSR activists in Gagauzia and Transnistria proclaimed independence in order to remain within the USSR. The Gagauz Republic was eventually peacefully incorporated into Moldavia as an autonomous territory, but relations with Transnistria soured. Its sovereignty was declared on June 23, 1990 on its territory\\r\\nOn March 17, 1991, Moldova, alongside with the Baltic states, Armenia and Georgia boycotted the union-wide preservation vote with 98.72% in favor without any official sanction.\\r\\nOn May 23, 1991, the Moldavian parliament changed the name of the republic to the Republic of Moldova. Gagauzia declared independence on August 19, 1991.\\r\\nMoldova then seceded from the Soviet Union and became a sovereign, independent state on August 27, 1991, after the failed coup in Moscow. After that period, on August 22, 1991 at 12:15 pm Kishinev time, the statue of Vladimir Lenin was toppled by protesters in the Moldavian capital.\\r\\nIndependence was quickly followed by civil war in the east of the country (Transnistria), where the central government in Chi?in?u battled with separatists, who were supported by pro-Soviet forces and by different forces from Russia. The conflict left the breakaway regime (Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic) in control of Transnistria - a situation that persists today. The Soviet Union ceased to exist on December 26, 1991 and Moldova became an independent state.\\r\\nIn the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty, the Soviet Union and Romania reaffirmed each other's borders, recognizing Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and the Herza region as territory of the respective Soviet republics.[19]\\r\\nThroughout the Cold War, the issue of Bessarabia remained largely dormant in Romania. In the 1950s, research on history and of Bessarabia was a banned subject in Romania, as the Romanian Communist Party tried to emphasise the links between the Romanians and Russians, the annexation being considered just a proof of Soviet Union's internationalism.[20]\\r\\nStarting with the 1960s, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Nicolae Ceau?escu began a policy of distancing from the Soviet Union, but the debate over Bessarabia was discussed only in scholarship fields such as historiography and linguistics, not at a political level.[21]\\r\\nAs the Soviet-Romanian relations reached an all-time low in the mid-1960s, Soviet scholars published historical papers on the \\"Struggle of Unification of Bessarabia with the Soviet motherland\\" (Artiom Lazarev) and the \\"Development of the Moldavian language\\" (Nicolae Corl??eanu). On the other side, the Romanian Academy published some notes by Karl Marx which talk about the \\"injustice\\" of the 1812 annexation of Bessarabia and Nicolae Ceau?escu in a 1965 speech quoted a letter by Friedrich Engels in which he criticized the Russian annexation, while in another 1966 speech, he denounced the pre-World War II calls of the Romanian Communist Party for the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and Bukovina.[22]\\r\\nThe issue was brought to light whenever the relationships with the Soviets were waning, but never became a serious subject of high-level negotiations in itself. As late as November 1989, as Russian support decreased, Ceau?escu brought up the Bessarabian question once again and denounced the Soviet invasion during the 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party.[23]\\r\\nOn June 22, 1976, ?tefan Andrei underscored to President Gerald Ford, at the White House, that, while it harbored no territorial claims and recognized \\"the Moldavian Socialist Republic as an integral part of the USSR, it cannot accept the idea that Moldavians are not Romanians.\\"[24]\\r\\nOn 1ÿ2 August 1976, Nicolae Ceau?escu, Elena Ceau?escu, Nicu Ceau?escu, ?tefan Andrei, Ambassador Gheorghe Badrus were the first high-level Romanian visitors to the Moldavian SSR since World War II. On 1 August, they came from Ia?i and the First Secretary Ivan Bodiul, Kiril Iliashenko?(ro), N. Mereni?cev escorted them from the border, and on leaving for the Crimea at the Chi?in?u International Airport on 2 August. The move was widely interpreted as a sign of improved relations.[25] During a meeting, Brezhnev insisted that Ceau?escu himself had the opportunity to see that the Moldavians existed as a separate people with a separate language during his 1976 visit. \\"Yes,\\" Ceau?escu replied, \\"I did, but they spoke with me in Romanian.\\"[26]\\r\\nIn December 1976, Bodiul and his wife Claudia arrived for a return visit of five days at Ceau?escu's invitation. Bodiul's visit was a \\"first\\" in the history of postwar bilateral relations. At one of his meetings in Bucharest, Bodiul said that \\"the good relationship was initiated by Ceau?escu's visit to Soviet Moldavia, which led to the expansion of contacts and exchanges in all fields.\\r\\nA visit was paid from 14 to 16 June 1979, to the Moldavian SSR by a Romanian Communist Party delegation headed by Ion Iliescu, Political Executive Committee alternate member and Ia?i County Party Committee First Secretary.[27]\\r\\nAfter the fall of communism in Romania, on April 5, 1991, its president Ion Iliescu, and the president of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev signed a political treaty which among other things recognized the Soviet-Romanian border. However, Parliament of Romania refused to ratify it.[28] Romania and Russia eventually signed and ratified a treaty in 2003, after the independence of Moldova and Ukraine.[29]\\r\\nThe Moldavian Communist Party was a component of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party was the sole legal political organization. It had supreme power in the land, as all state and public organizations were its subordinates.\\r\\nUntil the 1978 Constitution of the Moldavian SSR (15 April 1978), the republic had four cities directly subordinated to the republican government: Chi?in?u, B?l?i, Bender, and Tiraspol. By the new constitution, the following cities were added to this category: Orhei, R?bni?a, Soroca, and Ungheni.[34] The former 4 cities, and 40 raions were the first-tier administrative units of the land.\\r\\nAlthough it was the most densely populated republic of the USSR, the Moldavian SSR was meant to be a rural country specialized in agriculture. Kyrgyzstan was the only Soviet Republic to hold a larger percentage of rural population.[35]\\r\\nWhile holding just 0.2% of the Soviet territory, it accounted for 10% of the canned food production, 4.2% of its vegetables, 12.3% of its fruits and 8.2% of its wine production.[35]\\r\\nAt the same time, most of the Moldavian industry was built in Transnistria. While accounting for roughly 15% of the population of Moldavian SSR, Transnistria was responsible for 40% of its GDP and for 90% of electricity production.[36]\\r\\nMajor factories included the R?bni?a steel mill, Dub?sari and Moldavskaia power station and the factories near Tiraspol, producing refrigerators, clothing and alcohol.[35]\\r\\nThe political elite of the Moldavian SSR was one of the most loyal among the Soviet Republics.[37]\\r\\nSome towns and villages were renamed after various Communist leaders.\\r\\nBeginning with the early 1950s, the government gradually abandoned the language standard based on the central Bessarabian speech, established as official during the Moldavian ASSR, in favour of the Romanian standard. Hence, Mihai Eminescu and Vasile Alecsandri were again allowed, and the standard written language became the same as Romanian, except that it was written with Cyrillic script. However access to Romanian authors born outside the medieval Principality of Moldavia was restricted, as was the case with works by authors such as Eminescu, Mihail Kog?lniceanu, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Constantin Stere that promoted a Romanian national sentiment. However, contacts with Romania were not severed and, after 1956, people were slowly allowed to visit or receive relatives in Romania. Furthermore, Romanian press became accessible, and cross-border Romanian TV and radio programmes could be easily received. Nevertheless, the Soviet-Romanian border along the Prut river, separating Bessarabia from Romania, was closed for the general public.\\r\\nIn 1940, at the beginning of the Soviet occupation, the Capitoline Wolf, Chi?in?u was destroyed.\\r\\nThe little nationalism which existed in the Moldavian elite manifested itself in poems and articles in literary journals, before their authors being purged in campaigns against \\"anti-Soviet feelings\\" and \\"local nationalism\\" organized by Bodiul and Grossu.[37]\\r\\nThe official stance of the Soviet government was that Moldavian culture was distinct from Romanian culture, but they had a more coherent policy than the previous one from the Moldavian ASSR.[38] There were no more attempts in creating a Moldavian language that is different from Romanian, the literary Romanian written with the Cyrillic alphabet being accepted as the linguistic standard for Moldavia, the only difference being in some technical terms borrowed from Russian.[39]\\r\\nMoldavians were encouraged to adopt the Russian language, which was required for any leadership job (Russian was intended to be the language of interethnic communication in the Soviet Union). In the early years, political and academic positions were given to members of non-Moldavian ethnic groups (only 14% of the Moldavian SSR's political leaders were ethnic Moldavians in 1946), although this changed as time went on.\\r\\nLiterary critics stressed the Russian influence on Moldavian literature and ignored the parts shared with Romanian literature[citation needed].\\r\\nIn the aftermath of World War II, many Russians and Ukrainians, along with a smaller number of other ethnic groups, migrated from the rest of the USSR to Moldavia in order to help rebuild the heavily war-damaged economy. They were mostly factory and construction workers who settled in major urban areas, as well as military personnel stationed in the region. From a socio-economic point of view, this group was quite diverse: in addition to industrial and construction workers, as well as retired officers and soldiers of the Soviet army, it also included engineers, technicians, a handful of scientists, but mostly unqualified workers.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccess of native Bessarabians to positions in administration and economy was limited, as they were considered untrustworthy. The first local to become minister in the Moldavian SSR was only in the 1960s as minister of health. The antagonism between \\"natives\\", and \\"newcomers\\" persisted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union and was clear during the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist events in 1988-1992.[citation needed] The immigration affected mostly the cities of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, as well as the countryside of Budjak where the Bessarabian Germans previously were, but also the cities of Transnistria. All of these saw the proportion of ethnic Moldavians slowly drop throughout the Soviet rule.\\r\\nNote: \\"-\\" means the official census data does not identify that group in that year, i.e. counts it within other groups, not that the group is not present.\\r\\nThe Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Moldova will study and analyze the 1940-1991 period of the communist regime, as well as the period between 1917-1940 for the Autonomous Republic within the Ukrainian SSR.","input":"When did moldova become part of the ussr?"},{"output":"Jawaharlal Nehru","context":"The Prime Minister of India is the chief executive of the Government of India.

Serving until his death in May 1964, Nehru remains India's longest-serving prime minister. He was succeeded by fellow Congressman Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose 19-month term also ended in death. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, succeeded Shastri in 1966 to become the country's first woman premier. Eleven years later, she was voted out of power in favour of the Janata Party, whose leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister. After he resigned in 1979, his former deputy Charan Singh briefly held office until Indira Gandhi was voted back six months later. Indira Gandhi's second stint as Prime Minister ended five years later on the morning of 31 October 1984, when she was gunned down by her own bodyguards. That evening, her son Rajiv Gandhi was sworn-in as India's youngest premier, and the third from his family. Thus far, members of NehruÿGandhi dynasty have been Prime Minister for a total of 37 years and 303 days.[3]\\r\\nRajiv's five-year term ended with his former cabinet colleague, V. P. Singh of the Janata Dal, forming the year-long National Front coalition government in 1989. A six-month interlude under Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar followed, after which the Congress party returned to power, forming the government under P. V. Narasimha Rao in June 1991. Rao's five-year term was succeeded by four short-lived governmentsthe Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal Bihari Vajpayee for 13 days in 1996, a year each under United Front prime ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral, and Vajpayee again for 19 months in 1998ÿ99. After Vajpayee was sworn-in for the third time, in 1999, he managed to lead his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to a full five-year term, the first non-Congressman to do so. Vajpayee was succeeded by Congressman Manmohan Singh, the first Sikh premier, whose United Progressive Alliance government was in office for 10 years between 2004 and 2014.\\r\\nThe incumbent Prime Minister of India is Narendra Modi who has headed the BJP-led NDA government since 26 May 2014 which is India's first non-Congress single party majority government.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRajendra Prasad\\r\\nPrime Minister (Re-elected)\\r\\n(acting President)\\r\\nPratibha Patil","input":"Who is india's longest serving prime minister?"},{"output":"streaming media","context":"","input":"What product or market does netflix deal with?"},{"output":"biblical narrative of the escape of the Israelites, led by Moses, from the pursuing Egyptians","context":"The Crossing of the Red Sea (Hebrew: ????? ?? ??? Kriat Yam Suph - Crossing of the Red Sea or Sea of Reeds [1]) is part of the biblical narrative of the escape of the Israelites, led by Moses, from the pursuing Egyptians in the Book of Exodus 13:17-14:29. This story is also mentioned in the Quran in Surah 26: Al-Shu'ara' (The Poets) in verses 60-67.[1]\\r\\nAccording to the Exodus account, Moses held out his staff and the Red Sea was parted by God. The Israelites walked on the exposed dry ground and crossed the sea, followed by the Egyptian army. Moses again moved his staff once the Israelites had crossed and the sea closed again, drowning the whole Egyptian army.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGod chooses Moses to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and into the land of Canaan, which God has promised to them. The Egyptian pharaoh, who previously said the opposite, agrees to let them go, and they travel from Ramesses to Succoth and then to Etham on the edge of the desert, led by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. There God tells Moses to turn back and camp by the sea at Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon.\\r\\nGod causes the pharaoh to pursue the Israelites with chariots, and he overtakes them at Pi-hahiroth. When the Israelites see the Egyptian army they are afraid, but the pillar of fire and the cloud separates the Israelites and the Egyptians. At God's command Moses holds his staff out over the water, and throughout the night a strong east wind divides the sea,[2] and the Israelites pass through with a wall of water on either side. The Egyptians pursue, but at daybreak God clogs their chariot-wheels and throws them into a panic, and with the return of the water the pharaoh and his entire army are destroyed (see Psalm 136:15). When the Israelites see the power of God they put their faith in God and in Moses, and sing a song of praise to the Lord for the crossing of the sea and the destruction of their enemies. (This song, at Exodus 15, is called the Song of the Sea).\\r\\nThe narrative contains at least three and possibly four layers. In the first layer (the oldest), God blows the sea back with a strong east wind, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry land; in the second, Moses stretches out his hand and the waters part in two walls; in the third, God clogs the chariot wheels of the Egyptians and they flee (in this version the Egyptians do not even enter the water); and in the fourth, the Song of the Sea, God casts the Egyptians into tehomat, the mythical abyss.[3]\\r\\nThe Israelites' first journey is from Ramesses to Succoth. Ramesses is generally identified with modern Qantir, the site of the 19th dynasty capital Per-Ramesses, and Succoth with Tell el-Maskhuta in Wadi Tumilat, the biblical Land of Goshen.[4] From Sukkoth the Israelites travel to Etham \\"on the edge of the desert,\\" then turn back to Pi-hahiroth, located between Migdol and the sea and directly opposite Baal Zephon. None of these have been identified with certainty. One theory with a wide following is that they refer collectively to the region of Lake Timsah, a salt lake north of the Gulf of Suez, and the nearest large body of water after Wadi Tumilat.[5] Lake Timsah was connected to Pithom in Gesem at various times by a canal, and a late 1st millennium text refers to Migdol Baal Zephon as a fort on the canal.[6]\\r\\nThe Hebrew term for the place of the crossing is \\"Yam Suph\\". Although this has traditionally been thought to refer to the salt water inlet located between Africa and the Arabian peninsula, known in English as the Red Sea, this is a mistranslation from the Greek Septuagint, and Hebrew suph never means \\"red\\" but rather \\"reeds\\".[7] (While it is not relevant to the identification of the body of water, suph also puns on the Hebrew suphah (\\"storm\\") and soph (\\"end\\"), referring to the events of the Exodus).[8]\\r\\nGeneral scholarly opinion is that the Exodus story combines a number of traditions, one of them at the \\"Reed Sea\\" (Lake Timsah, with the Egyptians defeated when the wheels of their chariots become clogged) and another at the far deeper Red Sea, allowing the more dramatic telling of events.[6]\\r\\nReeds tolerant of salt water flourish in the shallow string of lakes extending from Suez north to the Mediterranean Sea. Kenneth Kitchen and James Hoffmeier state that these reedy lakes and marshes along the isthmus of Suez are acceptable locations for yam suf.[9][10] The ancient yam suf is not confined to the modern Red Sea. Hoffmeier equates yam suf with the Egyptian term pa-tjufy (also written p3 twfy) from the Ramsside period, which refers to lakes in the eastern Nile delta.[11] He also describes references to p3 twfy in the context of the Island of Amun, thought to be modern Tell el-Balamun.[12] Tell el-Balamun was the most northerly city of Pharaonic Egypt about 29?km southwest of Damietta, located at 31.2586 North, 31.5714 East.[13][14]\\r\\nNo archaeological evidence has been found that confirms the crossing of the Red Sea ever took place. Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian archaeologist and formerly Egypt's Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, said of the Exodus and Passover story, the Israelite's biblical flight from Egypt and the 40 years of wandering the desert in search of the Promised Land, \\"Really, its a myth... Sometimes as archaeologists we have to say that never happened because there is no historical evidence.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe theme of Moses crossing the Red Sea was taken up by the panegyrists of Constantine the Great and applied to the battle of the Milvian Bridge (312). The theme enjoyed a vogue during the fourth century on carved sarcophagi: at least twenty-nine have survived in full or in fragments.[16] Eusebius of Caesarea cast Maxentius, drowned in the Tiber, in the role of Pharaoh, both in his Ecclesiastical History and in his eulogistic Life of Constantine.[17]","input":"What is the parting of the red sea?"},{"output":"21,678","context":"Gallup (Navajo: Na?nzhoozh) is a city in McKinley County, New Mexico, United States, with a population of 21,678 as of the 2010 census.

During World War II, the city fought successfully to prevent 800 Japanese American residents of Japanese descent from being placed in wartime internment, the only New Mexico city to do so.[4] [5]\\r\\nGallup is known as the \\"Heart of Indian Country\\" because it is on the edge of the Navajo reservation and is home to members of many other tribes as well.[6]\\r\\nU.S. Route 66 passes through Gallup, and the town's name is mentioned in the lyrics of the song of the same name (\\"You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, NM\\"). In 2003, the U.S. and New Mexico Departments of Transportation renumbered US Highway 666, the city's other major highway, as Route 491. Former Governor Bill Richardson pushed for (and got) the number changed because \\"666\\" is associated with Satan and Devil worship, and thus it was considered \\"cursed\\" or a \\"Beast\\" to some locals. The situation was exacerbated by the high death toll on the highway, which was largely a result of high rates of drivers under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and budget shortfalls among both the New Mexico Department of Transportation and state and local law enforcement agencies.[7]\\r\\nGallup has a modestly lively night time culture downtown, Indian dances during summertime nights, art crawls, small museums including a Navajo Code Talk museum.[8] Gallup commissioned a number of murals highlighting local culture and contributions dot downtown.[9][10]\\r\\nBeing the largest city between Flagstaff and Albuquerque, Gallup claims many notable buildings, places, events and people.[11] The historic El Rancho Hotel & Motel has hosted a numerous array of movie stars including John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Humphrey Bogart, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford, Kirk Douglas, Doris Day, Gregory Peck, and Burt Lancaster. The rugged terrain surrounding Gallup was popular with Hollywood filmmakers during the 1940s and 50s for the on-location shooting of Westerns. Actors and film crews would stay at that hotel during filming. Films made in Gallup include Billy the Kid (1930), Pursued (1947), The Sea of Grass (1947), Four Faces West (1948), Only the Valiant (1951), Ace in the Hole (1951), Escape from Fort Bravo (1953), A Distant Trumpet (1964), and The Hallelujah Trail (1965).\\r\\nGallup is sometimes called the \\"Indian Capital of the World\\", for its location in the heart of Native American lands, and the presence of Navajo, Zuni, Hopi, and other tribes. 1/3 of the city's population has Native American roots.

As a result of these mine closures, Gallup has a large socioeconomic poor population. The median income for a household in the city was $34,868, and the median income for a family was $39,197. Males had a median income of $33,380 versus $24,441 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,789.

For this reason the alternative terms of Precontact Americas, Pre-Colonial Americas or Prehistoric Americas are also in use. In areas of Latin America the term usually used is Pre-Hispanic.\\r\\nMany pre-Columbian civilizations established hallmarks which included permanent settlements, cities, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, major earthworks, and complex societal hierarchies. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European colonies and the arrival of enslaved Africans (c. late 16thÿearly 17th centuries),[1] and are known only through archaeological investigations and oral history. Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya civilization, had their own written records. Because many Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as heretical, men like Diego de Landa destroyed many texts in pyres, even while seeking to preserve native histories. Only a few hidden documents have survived in their original languages, while others were transcribed or dictated into Spanish, giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.\\r\\nIndigenous American cultures continue to evolve after the pre-Columbian era. Many of these peoples and their descendants continue traditional practices while evolving and adapting new cultural practices and technologies into their lives.\\r\\nBefore the development of archaeology in the 19th century, historians of the pre-Columbian period mainly interpreted the records of the European conquerors and the accounts of early European travelers and antiquaries. It was not until the nineteenth century that the work of men such as John Lloyd Stephens, Eduard Seler and Alfred P. Maudslay, and of institutions such as the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University, led to the reconsideration and criticism of the European sources. Now, the scholarly study of pre-Columbian cultures is most often based on scientific and multidisciplinary methodologies.[2]\\r\\nAsian nomads are thought to have entered the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge (Beringia), now the Bering Strait and possibly along the coast. Genetic evidence found in Amerindians' maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) supports the theory of multiple genetic populations migrating from Asia.[3][4] Over the course of millennia, Paleo-Indians spread throughout North and South America. Exactly when the first group of people migrated into the Americas is the subject of much debate. One of the earliest identifiable cultures was the Clovis culture, with sites dating from some 13,000 years ago. However, older sites dating back to 20,000 years ago have been claimed. Some genetic studies estimate the colonization of the Americas dates from between 40,000 and 13,000 years ago.[5] The chronology of migration models is currently divided into two general approaches. The first is the short chronology theory with the first movement beyond Alaska into the New World occurring no earlier than 14,000ÿ17,000 years ago, followed by successive waves of immigrants.[6][7][8][9] The second belief is the long chronology theory, which proposes that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date, possibly 50,000ÿ40,000 years ago or earlier.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nArtifacts have been found in both North and South America which have been dated to 14,000 years ago,[14] and accordingly humans have been proposed to have reached Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America by this time. In that case, the Eskimo peoples would have arrived separately and at a much later date, probably no more than 2,000 years ago, moving across the ice from Siberia into Alaska.\\r\\nThe North American climate was unstable as the ice age receded. It finally stabilized by about 10,000 years ago; climatic conditions were then very similar to today's.[15] Within this time frame, roughly pertaining to the Archaic Period, numerous archaeological cultures have been identified.\\r\\nThe unstable climate led to widespread migration, with early Paleo-Indians soon spreading throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct tribes.[16] The Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers, likely characterized by small, mobile bands consisting of approximately 20 to 50 members of an extended family. These groups moved from place to place as preferred resources were depleted and new supplies were sought.[17] During much of the Paleo-Indian period, bands are thought to have subsisted primarily through hunting now-extinct giant land animals such as mastodon and ancient bison.[18] Paleo-Indian groups carried a variety of tools. These included distinctive projectile points and knives, as well as less distinctive implements used for butchering and hide processing.\\r\\nThe vastness of the North American continent, and the variety of its climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landforms, led ancient peoples to coalesce into many distinct linguistic and cultural groups.[19] This is reflected in the oral histories of the indigenous peoples, described by a wide range of traditional creation stories which often say that a given people have been living in a certain territory since the creation of the world.\\r\\nOver the course of thousands of years, paleo-Indian people domesticated, bred and cultivated a number of plant species. These species were very nutritious, and they now constitute 50ÿ60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.[20] In general, Arctic, Subarctic, and coastal peoples continued to live as hunters and gatherers, while agriculture was adopted in more temperate and sheltered regions. But wherever it was adopted, plant cultivation permitted a dramatic rise in population.[15]\\r\\nAfter the migration or migrations, it was several thousand years before the first complex societies arose, the earliest emerging about seven to eight thousand years ago.[citation needed] As early as 6500 BCE, people in the Lower Mississippi Valley at the Monte Sano site were building complex earthwork mounds, probably for religious purposes. This is the earliest dated of numerous mound complexes found in present-day Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida. Since the late twentieth century, archeologists have explored and dated these sites. They have found that they were built by hunter-gatherer societies, whose people occupied the sites on a seasonal basis, and who had not yet developed ceramics. Watson Brake, a large complex of eleven platform mounds, was constructed beginning in 3400 BCE and added to over 500 years. This has changed earlier assumptions that complex construction arose only after societies had adopted agriculture, become sedentary, often developed stratified hierarchy, and generally also developed ceramics. These ancient people had organized to build complex mound projects from a different basis.\\r\\nUntil the accurate dating of Watson Brake and similar sites, the oldest mound complex was thought to be Poverty Point, also located in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Built about 1500 BCE, it is the centerpiece of a culture extending over 100 sites on both sides of the Mississippi. The Poverty Point site has earthworks in the form of six concentric half-circles, divided by radial aisles, together with some mounds. The entire complex is nearly a mile across.\\r\\nMound building was continued by succeeding cultures, who built numerous sites in the middle Mississippi and Ohio River valleys as well, adding effigy mounds, conical and ridge mounds and other shapes.\\r\\nThe Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 BCE to 1000 CE in the eastern part of North America. The term \\"Woodland\\" was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites between the Archaic period and the Mississippian cultures. The Adena culture and the ensuing Hopewell tradition during this period built monumental earthwork architecture and established continent-spanning trade and exchange networks.\\r\\nThis period is considered a developmental stage without any massive changes in a short period, but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools, leather working, textile manufacture, tool production, cultivation, and shelter construction. Some Woodland peoples continued to use spears and atlatls until the end of the period, when they were replaced by bows and arrows.\\r\\nThe Mississippian culture was spread across the Southeast and Midwest from the Atlantic coast to the edge of the plains, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Upper Midwest, although most intensively in the area along the Mississippi River and Ohio River. One of the distinguishing features of this culture was the construction of complexes of large earthen mounds and grand plazas, continuing the moundbuilding traditions of earlier cultures. They grew maize and other crops intensively, participated in an extensive trade network and had a complex stratified society. The Mississippians first appeared around 1000 CE, following and developing out of the less agriculturally intensive and less centralized Woodland period. The largest urban site of this people, Cahokialocated near modern East St. Louis, Illinoismay have reached a population of over 20,000. Other chiefdoms were constructed throughout the Southeast, and its trade networks reached to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia was the most populous city in North America. (Larger cities did exist in Mesoamerica and South America.) Monk's Mound, the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World. The culture reached its peak in about 1200ÿ1400 CE, and in most places, it seems to have been in decline before the arrival of Europeans.\\r\\nMany Mississippian peoples were encountered by the expedition of Hernando de Soto in the 1540s, mostly with disastrous results for both sides. Unlike the Spanish expeditions in Mesoamerica, who conquered vast empires with relatively few men, the de Soto expedition wandered the American Southeast for four years, becoming more bedraggled, losing more men and equipment, and eventually arriving in Mexico as a fraction of its original size. The local people fared much worse though, as the fatalities of diseases introduced by the expedition devastated the populations and produced much social disruption. By the time Europeans returned a hundred years later, nearly all of the Mississippian groups had vanished, and vast swaths of their territory were virtually uninhabited.[21]\\r\\nWhen the Europeans arrived, indigenous peoples of North America had a wide range of lifeways from sedentary, agrarian societies to semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. Many formed new tribes or confederations in response to European colonization. These are often classified by cultural regions, loosely based on geography. These can include the following:\\r\\nNumerous pre-Columbian societies were sedentary, such as the Pueblo peoples, Mandan, Hidatsa and others, and some established large settlements, even cities, such as Cahokia, in what is now Illinois. The Iroquois League of Nations or \\"People of the Long House\\" was a politically advanced, democratic society, which is thought by some historians to have influenced the United States Constitution,[22][23] with the Senate passing a resolution to this effect in 1988.[24] Other historians have contested this interpretation and believe the impact was minimal, or did not exist, pointing to numerous differences between the two systems and the ample precedents for the constitution in European political thought.[25][26][27]\\r\\nMesoamerica is the region extending from central Mexico south to the northwestern border of Costa Rica that gave rise to a group of stratified, culturally related agrarian civilizations spanning an approximately 3,000-year period before the visits to the New World by Christopher Columbus. Mesoamerican is the adjective generally used to refer to that group of pre-Columbian cultures. This refers to an environmental area occupied by an assortment of ancient cultures that shared religious beliefs, art, architecture, and technology in the Americas for more than three thousand years.\\r\\nBetween 2000 and 300 BCE, complex cultures began to form in Mesoamerica. Some matured into advanced pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Olmec, Teotihuacan, Maya, Zapotec, Mixtec, Huastec, Purepecha, Toltec, and Mexica/Aztecs. The Mexica civilization is also known as the Aztec Triple Alliance, since they were three smaller kingdoms loosely united together.[28]\\r\\nThese indigenous civilizations are credited with many inventions: building pyramid-temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, writing, highly accurate calendars, fine arts, intensive agriculture, engineering, an abacus calculator, and complex theology. They also invented the wheel, but it was used solely as a toy. In addition, they used native copper, silver and gold for metalworking.\\r\\nArchaic inscriptions on rocks and rock walls all over northern Mexico (especially in the state of Nuevo Le܇n) demonstrate an early propensity for counting. Their number system was base 20 and included zero. These early count-markings were associated with astronomical events and underscore the influence that astronomical activities had upon Mesoamerican people before the arrival of Europeans. Many of the later Mesoamerican civilizations carefully built their cities and ceremonial centers according to specific astronomical events.\\r\\nThe biggest Mesoamerican cities, such as Teotihuacan, Tenochtitlan, and Cholula, were among the largest in the world. These cities grew as centers of commerce, ideas, ceremonies, and theology, and they radiated influence outwards onto neighboring cultures in central Mexico.\\r\\nWhile many city-states, kingdoms, and empires competed with one another for power and prestige, Mesoamerica can be said to have had five major civilizations: the Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Toltec, the Mexica and the Maya. These civilizations (with the exception of the politically fragmented Maya) extended their reach across Mesoamericaand beyondlike no others. They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and theology. Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these civilizations over the span of 4,000 years. Many made war with them, but almost all peoples found themselves within one of their spheres of influence.\\r\\nRegional communications in ancient Mesoamerica have been the subject of considerable research. There is evidence of trade routes starting as far north as the Mexico Central Plateau, and going down to the Pacific coast. These trade routes and cultural contacts then went on as far as Central America. These networks operated with various interruptions from pre-Olmec times and up to the Late Classical Period (600ÿ900 CE).\\r\\nThe earliest known civilization is the Olmec. This civilization established the cultural blueprint by which all succeeding indigenous civilizations would follow in Mexico. Pre-Olmec civilization began with the production of pottery in abundance, around 2300 BCE in the Grijalva River delta. Between 1600 and 1500 BCE, the Olmec civilization had begun, with the consolidation of power at their capital, a site today known as San Lorenzo Tenochtitln near the coast in southeast Veracruz.[29] The Olmec influence extended across Mexico, into Central America, and along the Gulf of Mexico. They transformed many peoples' thinking toward a new way of government, pyramid-temples, writing, astronomy, art, mathematics, economics, and religion. Their achievements paved the way for the Maya civilization and the civilizations in central Mexico.\\r\\nThe decline of the Olmec resulted in a power vacuum in Mexico. Emerging from that vacuum was Teotihuacan, first settled in 300 BCE. By 150 CE, Teotihuacan had risen to become the first true metropolis of what is now called North America. Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order never before seen in Mexico. Its influence stretched across Mexico into Central America, founding new dynasties in the Maya cities of Tikal, Copan, and Kaminaljuy~. Teotihuacan's influence over the Maya civilization cannot be overstated: it transformed political power, artistic depictions, and the nature of economics. Within the city of Teotihuacan was a diverse and cosmopolitan population. Most of the regional ethnicities of Mexico were represented in the city, such as Zapotecs from the Oaxaca region. They lived in apartment communities where they worked their trades and contributed to the city's economic and cultural prowess. Teotihuacan's economic pull impacted areas in northern Mexico as well. It was a city whose monumental architecture reflected a monumental new era in Mexican civilization, declining in political power about 650 CEbut lasting in cultural influence for the better part of a millennium, to around 950 CE.\\r\\nContemporary with Teotihuacan's greatness was that of the Maya civilization. The period between 250 CE and 650 CE was a time of intense flourishing of Maya civilized accomplishments. While the many Maya city-states never achieved political unity on the order of the central Mexican civilizations, they exerted a tremendous intellectual influence upon Mexico and Central America. The Maya built some of the most elaborate cities on the continent, and made innovations in mathematics, astronomy, and calendrics. The Mayans also evolved the only true writing system native to the Americas using pictographs and syllabic elements in the form of texts and codices inscribed on stone, pottery, wood, or highly perishable books made from bark paper.\\r\\nWith the decline of the Toltec civilization came political fragmentation in the Valley of Mexico. Into this new political game of contenders to the Toltec throne stepped outsiders: the Mexica. They were also a desert people, one of seven groups who formerly called themselves \\"Azteca\\", in memory of Aztln, but they changed their name after years of migrating. Since they were not from the Valley of Mexico, they were initially seen as crude and unrefined in the ways of Nahua civilization. Through political maneuvers and ferocious fighting skills, they managed to become the rulers of Mexico as the head of the 'Triple Alliance' (which included two other \\"Aztec\\" cities, Texcoco and Tlacopan).\\r\\nLatecomers to Mexico's central plateau, the Mexica thought of themselves, nevertheless, as heirs of the civilizations that had preceded them. For them, arts, sculpture, architecture, engraving, feather-mosaic work, and the calendar, were bequest from the former inhabitants of Tula, the Toltecs.\\r\\nThe Mexica-Aztecs were the rulers of much of central Mexico by about 1400 (while Yaquis, Coras and Apaches commanded sizable regions of northern desert), having subjugated most of the other regional states by the 1470s. At their peak, 300,000 Mexica[citation needed] presided over a wealthy tribute-empire variously estimated at 5ÿ8 million people in total a population of 8ÿ12 millions. The actual population is never more than an estimate. The modern name \\"Mexico\\" comes from their name.\\r\\nTheir capital, Tenochtitlan, is the site of modern-day capital of Mexico, Mexico City. At its peak, it was one of the largest cities in the world with population estimates of 200ÿ300,000.[30] The market established there was the largest ever seen by the conquistadors on arrival.\\r\\nBy the first millennium, South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains, and coasts were the home of millions of people. Estimates vary, but 30ÿ50 million are often given and 100 million by some estimates. Some groups formed permanent settlements. Among those groups were Chibcha-speaking peoples (\\"Muisca\\" or \\"Muysca\\"), Valdivia, Quimbaya, Calima and the Tairona. The Muisca of Colombia, postdating the Herrera Period, Valdivia of Ecuador, the Quechuas and the Aymara of Peru and Bolivia were the four most important sedentary Amerindian groups in South America. From the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, Brazil, supporting Spanish accounts of a complex, possibly ancient Amazonian civilization.[31][32]\\r\\nThe theory of pre-Columbian contact across the South Pacific Ocean between South America and Polynesia has received support from several lines of evidence, although solid confirmation remains elusive. A diffusion by human agents has been put forward to explain the pre-Columbian presence in Oceania of several cultivated plant species native to South America, such as the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) or sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Direct archaeological evidence for such pre-Columbian contacts and transport have not emerged. Similarities noted in names of edible roots in Maori and Ecuadorian languages (\\"kumari\\") and Melanesian and Chilean (\\"gaddu\\") have been inconclusive.[33]\\r\\nA 2007 paper published in PNAS put forward DNA and archaeological evidence that domesticated chickens had been introduced into South America via Polynesia by late pre-Columbian times.[34] These findings were challenged by a later study published in the same journal, that cast doubt on the dating calibration used and presented alternative mtDNA analyses that disagreed with a Polynesian genetic origin.[35] The origin and dating remains an open issue. Whether or not early PolynesianÿAmerican exchanges occurred, no compelling human-genetic, archaeological, cultural or linguistic legacy of such contact has turned up.\\r\\nOn the north-central coast of present-day Peru, Norte Chico or Caral (as known in Peru) was a civilization that emerged around 3000 BCE (contemporary with urbanism's rise in Mesopotamia.) It is considered one of the six cradles of civilization in the world.[28] It had a cluster of large-scale urban settlements of which the Sacred City of Caral, in the Supe valley, is one of the largest and best studied sites. Norte Chico or Caral is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and persisted until around 1800 BCE.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Valdivia culture was concentrated on the coast of Ecuador. Their existence was recently discovered by archeological findings. Their culture is among the oldest found in the Americas, spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE. The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza. They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing, though occasionally they hunted for deer. From the remains that have been found, scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated maize, kidney beans, squash, cassava, hot peppers, and cotton plants, the last of which was used to make clothing. Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical, but it became showy, delicate, and big over time. They generally used red and gray colors; and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period. In its ceramics and stone works, the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works.\\r\\nThe Ca?ari were the indigenous natives of today's Ecuadorian provinces of Ca?ar and Azuay. They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and complex religious beliefs. The Inca destroyed and burned most of their remains. The Ca?ari's old city was replaced twice, first by the Incan city of Tumebamba and later on the same site by the colonial city of Cuenca. The city was also believed to be the site of El Dorado, the city of gold from the mythology of Colombia. (see Cuenca)\\r\\nThe Ca?ari were most notable for having repelled the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to Tupac Yupanqui. Many of their descendants are still present in Ca?ar. The majority did not mix with the colonists or become Mestizos.\\r\\nThe Chavn, a South American preliterate civilization, established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavn in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. The Chavn civilization spanned from 900 to 300 BCE.\\r\\nThe Chibcha-speaking communities were the most numerous, the most territorially extended and the most socio-economically developed of the pre-Hispanic Colombians. By the 8th century, the indigenous people had established their civilization in the northern Andes. At one point, the Chibchas occupied part of what is now Panama, and the high plains of the Eastern Sierra of Colombia.\\r\\nThe areas which they occupied in Colombia were the present-day Departments of Santander (North and South), Boyac and Cundinamarca. This is where the first farms and industries were developed. It is also where the independence movement originated. They are currently the richest areas in Colombia. The Chibcha developed the most populous zone between the Mayan and Inca empires. Next to the Quechua of Peru and the Aymara in Bolivia, the Chibcha of the eastern and north-eastern Highlands of Colombia developed the most notable culture among the sedentary indigenous peoples in South America.\\r\\nIn the Colombian Andes, the Chibcha comprised several tribes who spoke similar languages (Chibcha). They included the following: the Muisca, Guane, Lache, Cofn, and Chitareros.\\r\\nThe Moche thrived on the north coast of Peru from about 100 to 800 CE. The heritage of the Moche is seen in their elaborate burials. Some were recently excavated by UCLA's Christopher B. Donnan in association with the National Geographic Society.\\r\\nAs skilled artisans, the Moche were a technologically advanced people. They traded with distant peoples such as the Maya. What has been learned about the Moche is based on study of their ceramic pottery; the carvings reveal details of their daily lives. The Larco Museum of Lima, Peru has an extensive collection of such ceramics. They show that the people practiced human sacrifice, had blood-drinking rituals, and that their religion incorporated non-procreative sexual practices (such as fellatio).\\r\\nThe Tiwanaku empire was based in western Bolivia and extended into present-day Peru and Chile from 300 to 1000. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important South American civilizations prior to the Inca Empire; it was the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south-eastern shore of Lake Titicaca in Tiwanaku Municipality, Ingavi Province, La Paz Department, about 72 kilometres (45?mi) west of La Paz.\\r\\nHolding their capital at the great cougar-shaped city of Cuzco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as Tawantinsuyu, or \\"the land of the four regions\\", in Quechua, the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 40,000 kilometer road system. Cities were built with precise stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful brain surgery in Inca civilization.\\r\\nAlso known as the Omagua, Umana and Kambeba, the Cambeba are an indigenous people in Brazil's Amazon basin. The Cambeba were a populous, organized society in the late Pre-Columbian era whose population suffered steep decline in the early years of the Columbian Exchange. The Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana traversed the Amazon River during the 16th century and reported densely populated regions running hundreds of kilometers along the river. These populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they used local wood as their construction material as stone was not locally available. While it is possible Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development among the Amazonians, their semi-nomadic descendants have the odd distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, aristocracy. Archaeological evidence has revealed the continued presence of semi-domesticated orchards, as well as vast areas of land enriched with terra preta. Both of these discoveries, along with Cambeba ceramics discovered within the same archaeological levels suggest that a large and organized civilization existed in the area.[36]\\r\\nEarly inhabitants of the Americas developed agriculture, developing and breeding maize (corn) from ears 2ÿ5?cm in length to the current size are familiar today. Potatoes, tomatoes, tomatillos (a husked green tomato), pumpkins, chili peppers, squash, beans, pineapple, sweet potatoes, the grains quinoa and amaranth, cocoa beans, vanilla, onion, peanuts, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, papaya, and avocados were among other plants grown by natives. Over two-thirds of all types of food crops grown worldwide are native to the Americas.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe natives began using fire in a widespread manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines. This created the Pre-Columbian savannas of North America.[37]\\r\\nWhile not as widespread as in other areas of the world (Asia, Africa, Europe), indigenous Americans did have livestock. Domesticated turkeys were common in Mesoamerica and in some regions of North America; they were valued for their meat, feathers, and, possibly, eggs. There is documentation of Mesoamericans utilizing hairless dogs, especially the Xoloitzcuintle breed, for their meat. Andean societies had llamas and alpacas for meat and wool, as well as for beasts of burden. Guinea pigs were raised for meat in the Andes. Iguanas and a range of wild animals, such as deer and pecari, were another source of meat in Mexico, Central, and northern South America.\\r\\nBy the 15th century, maize had been transmitted from Mexico and was being farmed in the Mississippi embayment, as far as the East Coast of the United States, and as far north as southern Canada. Potatoes were utilized by the Inca, and chocolate was used by the Aztecs.\\r\\nThe haplogroup most commonly associated with Indigenous Amerindian genetics is Haplogroup Q1a3a (Y-DNA).[38] Y-DNA, like mtDNA, differs from other nuclear chromosomes in that the majority of the Y chromosome is unique and does not recombine during meiosis. This has the effect that the historical pattern of mutations can easily be studied.[39] The pattern indicates Indigenous Amerindians experienced two very distinctive genetic episodes; first with the initial-peopling of the Americas, and secondly with European colonization of the Americas.[40][41] The former is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages and founding haplotypes present in today's Indigenous Amerindian populations.[41]\\r\\nHuman settlement of the New World occurred in stages from the Bering sea coast line, with an initial 20,000-year layover on Beringia for the founding population.[42][43] The micro-satellite diversity and distributions of the Y lineage specific to South America indicates that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.[44] The Na-Den, Inuit and Indigenous Alaskan populations exhibit haplogroup Q-M242 (Y-DNA) mutations, however are distinct from other indigenous Amerindians with various mtDNA mutations.[45][46][47] This suggests that the earliest migrants into the northern extremes of North America and Greenland derived from later populations.[48]","input":"Early cultures were present in the americas before the arrival of?"},{"output":"Daehan Mingug","context":"The President of the Republic of Korea (Hangul:????? ???; Hanja:?έg?? ξ~B; RR:?Daehan Mingug Daetonglyeong) is, according to the South Korean constitution, the chairperson of the cabinet, the chief executive of the government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the head of state of South Korea. The Constitution and the amended Presidential Election Act of 1987 provide for election of the president by direct, secret ballot, ending sixteen years of indirect presidential elections under the preceding two governments. The president is directly elected to a five-year term, with no possibility of re-election.[1] If a presidential vacancy should occur, a successor must be elected within sixty days, during which time presidential duties are to be performed by the prime minister or other senior cabinet members in the order of priority as determined by law. While in office, the chief executive lives in Cheong Wa Dae (the \\"Blue House\\"), and is exempt from criminal liability (except for insurrection or treason).\\r\\nMoon Jae-in, former human rights lawyer and chief of staff to then-President Roh Moo-hyun,[2] assumed post of President of South Korea on 10 May 2017[3] immediately upon being elected with a plurality of 41.1%, in contrast to 24.0% and 21.4% won by his major opponents, conservative Hong Joon-pyo and centrist Ahn Cheol-soo, respectively.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3 of the South Korean constitution states the duties and the powers of the president.

In times of serious internal or external turmoil or threat, or economic or financial crises, the president may assume emergency powers \\"for the maintenance of national security or public peace and order.\\" Emergency measures may be taken only when the National Assembly is not in session and when there is no time for it to convene. The measures are limited to the \\"minimum necessary.\\"\\r\\nThe 1987 Constitution removed the 1980 Constitution's explicit provisions that empowered the government to temporarily suspend the freedoms and rights of the people. However, the president is permitted to take other measures that could amend or abolish existing laws for the duration of a crisis. It is unclear whether such emergency measures could temporarily suspend portions of the Constitution itself. Emergency measures must be referred to the National Assembly for concurrence. If not endorsed by the assembly, the emergency measures can be revoked; any laws that had been overridden by presidential order regain their original effect. In this respect, the power of the legislature is more vigorously asserted than in cases of ratification of treaties or declarations of war, in which the Constitution simply states that the National Assembly \\"has the right to consent\\" to the president's actions. In a change from the 1980 Constitution, the 1987 Constitution stated that the president is not permitted to dissolve the National Assembly.\\r\\nThe official residence of the president is Cheong Wa Dae. It means 'the House of the Blue Roof Tiles', so it is also called the \\"Blue House\\" in English. The president is assisted by the staff of the Presidential Secretariat, headed by a cabinet-rank secretary general. Apart from the State Council, or cabinet, the chief executive relies on several constitutional organs.\\r\\nThese constitutional organs included the National Security Council, which provided advice concerning the foreign, military, and domestic policies bearing on national security. Chaired by the president, the council in 1990 had as its statutory members the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the ministers for foreign affairs, home affairs, finance, and national defense, the director of the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) which was known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) until December 1980, and others designated by the president. Another important body is the National Unification Advisory Council, inaugurated in June 1981 under the chairpersonship of the president. From its inception, this body had no policy role, but rather appeared to serve as a government sounding board and as a means to disburse political rewards by providing large numbers of dignitaries and others with titles and opportunities to meet periodically with the president and other senior officials.\\r\\nThe president also was assisted in 1990 by the Audit and Inspection Board. In addition to auditing the accounts of all public institutions, the board scrutinized the administrative performance of government agencies and public officials. Its findings were reported to the president and the National Assembly, which itself had broad powers to inspect the work of the bureaucracy under the provisions of the Constitution. Board members were appointed by the president.\\r\\nOne controversial constitutional organ was the Advisory Council of Elder Statesmen, which replaced a smaller body in February 1988, just before Roh Tae Woo was sworn in as president. This body was supposed to be chaired by the immediate former president; its expansion to eighty members, broadened functions, and elevation to cabinet rank made it appear to have been designed, as one Seoul newspaper said, to \\"preserve the status and position of a certain individual.\\" The government announced plans to reduce the size and functions of this body immediately after Roh's inauguration. Public suspicions that the council might provide former President Chun with a power base within the Sixth Republic were rendered moot when Chun withdrew to an isolated Buddhist temple in self-imposed exile in November 1988.\\r\\nArticle 71 of the Constitution of South Korea states, 'In the event of the president not being able to discharge the duties of his/her office, the Prime Minister and ministers in line of the order of succession shall be the acting president.'

The company was founded in 1899 by Herman Bergdorf and was later owned and managed by Edwin Goodman, and later his son Andrew Goodman.\\r\\nToday, Bergdorf Goodman operates from two stores situated across the street from each other at Fifth Avenue between 57th and 58th streets. The main store, which opened at its current location in 1928, is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue. A separate men's store, established in 1990, is located on the east side of Fifth Avenue, directly across the street.\\r\\nBergdorf Goodman is a subsidiary of Neiman Marcus, which is owned by the private equity firm Ares Management.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company traces its origins to 1899 when Herman Bergdorf, an immigrant from Alsace, opened a tailor shop just above Union Square in downtown Manhattan.\\r\\nEdwin Goodman, a 23-year-old merchant, based in Lockport, New York, moved to New York City to work as an apprentice for Bergdorf.[2] Within two years, Goodman had raised enough money to purchase an interest in the business, which was renamed Bergdorf Goodman in 1901. In 1906, Bergdorf Goodman moved to a new location on 32nd Street, just west of Fifth Avenue and \\"Ladies' Mile\\". While Bergdorf preferred the less expensive side street location, Goodman prevailed with the new location and bought Bergdorf's interest in the company. Bergdorf would retire to Paris.\\r\\nAlthough Goodman had developed a good business as a ladies' tailor on 32nd Street, he decided to move uptown in 1914. Goodman constructed a five-story building at 616 Fifth Avenue, on the site of what is today Rockefeller Center.[3] In 1914, Goodman became the first couturier to introduce ready-to-wear, making Bergdorf Goodman a destination for American and French fashion.\\r\\nThe store moved to its present location at 5th Avenue and 58th Street in 1928, building its Beaux-Arts style store on the site of the Cornelius Vanderbilt II mansion. He was unsure of the success of the new store's location, as he was uncertain whether customers would follow the store uptown. So, Goodman designed the new store so that it could be subdivided into sections with storefronts that could be rented out if needed. Early tenants included Van Cleef & Arpels, the Grande Maison de Blanc and Dobbs the Hatter.[4] During the Great Depression, however, Goodman thrived, buying the entire building. Throughout the 1930s, Goodman purchased the mortgages of the surrounding businesses, eventually acquiring the entire block. During this period, Bergdorf Goodman was successful enough to have merited an expansion beyond the single store. However, Goodman preferred to operate in a single location where he would be able to personally maintain the quality of the merchandise and service.\\r\\nGoodman's son, Andrew, assumed the role of president in 1951 and succeeded as head of the company in 1953, following the death of his father.[5] Andrew was responsible for enhancing Bergdorf's reputation and expanding its range of merchandise and services.\\r\\nDuring Andrew's tenure as chairman, Bergdorf opened a fur salon, developed the successful Bergdorf Goodman Number Nine perfume (\\"Love Potion Number Nine\\"), and created Miss Bergdorf, a ready-to-wear line for younger customers.\\r\\nThe store began a $1 million expansion in 1959 into two adjacent buildings. The Boys and Girls gift shop expanded into a whole floor, and the beauty salon and bridal, fur and men's departments also expanded. Eight years later, a $2.5 million expansion in 1967 nearly doubled the store's area, to 120,000 square feet (11,000?m2).[5]\\r\\nIn 1972, Andrew Goodman sold Bergdorf Goodman to Broadway-Hale Stores, which would become Carter Hawley Hale Stores (CHH) for $12.5 million. CHH had acquired Neiman Marcus, a three-unit operation at the time, in 1969. By the time of the sale, Bergdorf Goodman was the only large high-quality specialty store in the U.S. that remained independently owned. However, its decision not to build suburban branches left it with a relatively modest profit margin. Goodman remained the landlord of the store and kept a penthouse apartment on the building's top floor.[5]\\r\\nAt first, CHH considered building branch locations, ultimately only constructing one location, in nearby White Plains, New York in 1972. This location eventually became a Neiman Marcus branch in 1981. To combat its image difficulties, the company hired Dawn Mello in 1975 as vice president of fashion. She was successful in reinvigorating the conservative store and became president in 1984. She left her post in 1989 to work for the floundering Italian fashion house Gucci, though she returned to her post as president in 1994.\\r\\nBergdorf Goodman's parent company became the object of takeover bids in the 1980s. As a way to maintain its independence, Carter Hawley completed a major financial restructuring. In 1987, Bergdorf Goodman was spun-off, together with Neiman Marcus and Contempo Casuals, to form Neiman Marcus Group. The new company was headquartered in Dallas, Texas, where the significantly larger Neiman Marcus had been based for 80 years.\\r\\nChairman and CEO Ira Neimark expanded the women's store three times in the 1990s. He moved the men's store across the street to the former FAO Schwarz space at 745 Fifth Avenue in 1990. This move allowed more space for women's fashions. In 1997, the former Goodman family apartment on the building's ninth floor became the John Barrett Salon and Susan Ciminelli Day Spa. In 1999, the Beauty Level opened directly below the main floor, offering a luxury spa and Goodman's Caf, serving lunch and afternoon tea.[6]\\r\\nIn 2002, Bergdorf Goodman underwent a major renovation, during which artisans and craftspeople began a dramatic restoration of the main floor of the women's store. In 2003, the store introduced new boutiques for Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent. The Bergdorf Goodman Men's store features exclusive brands such as Loro Piana, Kiton, Brunello Cucinelli, John Lobb, Thom Browne, Bontoni, Tom Ford, and Charvet.\\r\\nOn May 2, 2005, two private equity firms, Texas Pacific Group and Warburg Pincus, acquired the Neiman Marcus Group and its Bergdorf subsidiary, in a leveraged buyout (LBO).[7]\\r\\nThe store has been the subject of two documentary films: the 2001 film Dita and the Family Business,[8] exploring the store from the point of view of its owners, and the 2013 feature documentary Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's, which features many testimonials from designers and celebrities.\\r\\nCoordinates: 404549N 735827W? / ?40.7635N 73.9742W? / 40.7635; -73.9742","input":"Are neiman marcus and bergdorf goodman the same?"},{"output":"logical structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era","context":"The Analytical Engine was a proposed mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage.[2][3] It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine, a design for a mechanical computer.[4] The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[5][6] In other words, the logical structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era.[3]\\r\\nBabbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding.[7][8] It was not until the 1940s that the first general-purpose computers were actually built, more than a century after Babbage had proposed the pioneering Analytical Engine in 1837.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBabbage's first attempt at a mechanical computing device, the Difference Engine, was a special-purpose machine designed to tabulate logarithms and trigonometric functions by evaluating finite differences to create approximating polynomials. Construction of this machine was never completed; Babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer, Joseph Clement, and ultimately the British government withdrew its funding for the project.[9][10][11]\\r\\nDuring this project, he realized that a much more general design, the Analytical Engine, was possible.[9] The work on the design of the Analytical Engine started in c. 1833.[12][4]\\r\\nThe input, consisting of programs and data (\\"formulae\\" and \\"data\\")[13][9] was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom.[14] For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell.[9] The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary base-10 fixed-point arithmetic.[9]\\r\\nThere was to be a store (that is, a memory) capable of holding 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits[15] each (ca. 16.2 kB). An arithmetical unit (the \\"mill\\") would be able to perform all four arithmetic operations, plus comparisons and optionally square roots.[16] Initially (1838) it was conceived as a difference engine curved back upon itself, in a generally circular layout, with the long store exiting off to one side.[17] Later drawings (1858) depict a regularized grid layout.[18] Like the central processing unit (CPU) in a modern computer, the mill would rely upon its own internal procedures, to be stored in the form of pegs inserted into rotating drums called \\"barrels\\", to carry out some of the more complex instructions the user's program might specify.[7]\\r\\nThe programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day assembly languages. Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been Turing-complete as later defined by Alan Turing. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards. Babbage developed some two dozen programs for the Analytical Engine between 1837 and 1840, and one program later.[14][19] These programs treat polynomials, iterative formulas, Gaussian elimination, and Bernoulli numbers.[14][20]\\r\\nIn 1842, the Italian mathematician Luigi Federico Menabrea published a description of the engine based on a lecture by Babbage in French. In 1843, the description was translated into English and extensively annotated by Ada Lovelace, who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier. In recognition of her additions to Menabrea's paper, which included a way to calculate Bernoulli numbers using the machine, she has been described as the first computer programmer.\\r\\nLate in his life, Babbage sought ways to build a simplified version of the machine, and assembled a small part of it before his death in 1871.[7][1]\\r\\nIn 1878, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science described the Analytical Engine as \\"a marvel of mechanical ingenuity\\", but recommended against constructing it. The committee acknowledged the usefulness and value of the machine, but could not estimate the cost of building it, and were unsure whether the machine would function correctly after being built.[22][23]\\r\\nIn 1906[24] Babbage's son Henry Prevost Babbage constructed a part of the mill and the printing apparatus, and calculated a (faulty) list of multiples of pi (published in 1910).[25] This constituted only a small part of the whole engine; it was not programmable and had no storage. (Popular images of this section have sometimes been mislabelled, implying that it was the entire mill or even the entire engine.) Henry Babbage's \\"Analytical Engine Mill\\" is on display at the Science Museum in London.[21] Henry also proposed building a demonstration version of the full engine, with a smaller storage capacity: \\"perhaps for a first machine ten (columns) would do, with fifteen wheels in each\\".[26] Such a version could manipulate 20?numbers of 25?digits each, and what it could be told to do with those numbers could still be impressive. \\"It is only a question of cards and time\\", wrote Henry Babbage in 1888, \\"... and there is no reason why (twenty thousand) cards should not be used if necessary, in an Analytical Engine for the purposes of the mathematician\\".[26]\\r\\nIn 1991, the London Science Museum built a complete and working specimen of Babbage's Difference Engine No. 2, a design that incorporated refinements Babbage discovered during the development of the Analytical Engine.[5] This machine was built using materials and engineering tolerances that would have been available to Babbage, quelling the suggestion that Babbage's designs could not have been produced using the manufacturing technology of his time.[27]\\r\\nIn October 2010, John Graham-Cumming started a \\"Plan 28\\" campaign to raise funds by \\"public subscription\\" to enable serious historical and academic study of Babbage's plans, with a view to then build and test a fully working virtual design which will then in turn enable construction of the physical Analytical Engine.[28][29] As of May 2016, actual construction had not been attempted, since no consistent understanding could yet be obtained from Babbages original design drawings.[30] By 2017, the \\"Plan 28\\" effort reported that a searchable database of all catalogued material was available, and an initial review of Babbages voluminous Scribbling Books had been completed.[31]\\r\\nBabbage is not known to have written down an explicit set of instructions for the engine in the manner of a modern processor manual. Instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution, showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided.\\r\\nAllan G. Bromley has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions, which would make the engine Turing-complete:\\r\\n...the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse (and hence to loop)...[14]\\r\\nThe introduction for the first time, in 1845, of user operations for a variety of service functions including, most importantly, an effective system for user control of looping in user programs. There is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified. In the absence of other evidence I have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in Babbages sample programs. There would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user.[32]\\r\\nIn their emulator of the engine, Fourmilab say:\\r\\nThe Engine's Card Reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish. It can, in addition, directed by the very cards it reads and advised by the whether the Mill's run-up lever is activated, either advance the card chain forward, skipping the intervening cards, or backward, causing previously-read cards to be processed once again.\\r\\nThis emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set, though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on Babbage's original works. For example, a factorial program would be written as:\\r\\nwhere the CB is the conditional branch instruction or \\"combination card' used to make the control flow jump, in this case backwards by 11 cards.\\r\\nBabbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as algorithmic efficiency, writing in his Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, \\"As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then ariseBy what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time?\\"[33]\\r\\nThe incomplete Analytical Engine was put on display to the public at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, London.[34]\\r\\nFrom 1872 Henry continued diligently with his father's work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875.[35] Percy Ludgate wrote about the engine in 1915[citation needed] and even designed his own Analytical Engine (it was drawn up in detail, but never built) about 1909.[24] Ludgate's engine would be much smaller than Babbage's of about 8 cubic feet (230 L), and hypothetically would be capable of multiplying two 20-decimal-digit numbers in about six seconds.\\r\\nDespite this groundwork, Babbage's work fell into historical obscurity, and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electro-mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work, resulting in the need to re-invent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed. Howard Aiken, who built the quickly-obsoleted electromechanical calculator, the Harvard Mark I, between 1937 and 1945, praised Babbage's work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature, but knew nothing of the Analytical Engine's architecture during the construction of the Mark I, and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the Analytical Engine \\"the greatest disappointment of my life\\".[36] The Mark I showed no influence from the Analytical Engine and lacked the Analytical Engine's most prescient architectural feature, conditional branching.[36] J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly similarly were not aware of the details of Babbage's Analytical Engine work prior to the completion of their design for the first electronic general-purpose computer, the ENIAC.[37][38]\\r\\nIf the Analytical Engine had been built, it would have been digital, programmable and Turing-complete. It would, however, have been very slow. Luigi Federico Menabrea reported in Sketch of the Analytical Engine: \\"Mr. Babbage believes he can, by his engine, form the product of two numbers, each containing twenty figures, in three minutes\\".[39] By comparison the Harvard Mark I could perform the same task in just six seconds. A modern PC can do the same thing in well under a millionth of a second.","input":"Why analytical engine often called the pioneer computer?"},{"output":"abbot","context":"In addition to its use in a Christian context, abbot is a term used in English-speaking countries for a monk who holds the position of administrator of a Buddhist monastery or large Buddhist temple.[2] In Buddhist nunneries, the nun who holds the equivalent position is known in English as the abbess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English word \\"abbot\\" is used instead of all the various words that exist in the languages of the countries where Buddhism is, or was historically, well established.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe administrative duties of an abbot or abbess include overseeing the day-to-day running of the monastery.[2][3] The Abbot or Abbess also has spiritual responsibility for the monastics under their care, and is required to interact with the abbots or abbesses of other monasteries.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAsian countries where Buddhism is still widely practiced have words in their own languages for the abbot of a Buddhist monastery or large temple:\\r\\n\\r\\nin Chinese Chan Buddhist monasteries, one word for abbot  is Fangzhang meaning \\"ten feet square\\", a reference to the size of Vimalakirti's stone room.[5] Another Chinese word for abbot is Zhuchi, meaning dweller and upholder.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Zen Buddhism, the most commonly used Japanese words for the abbot of a large Zen temple or Zen monastery are juji[7] and choro.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abbot of a Tibetan Buddhist monastery is known as the Khenpo.

Examples of such adaptations include slow metabolism, reduced energy consumption, better food usage efficiency, decrease or loss of eyesight (anophthalmia), and depigmentation (absence of pigment in the integument). Conversely, as opposed to lost or reduced functions, many species have evolved elongated antennal and locomotory appendages, in order to better move around and respond to environmental stimuli. These structures are also full of chemical, tactile and humidity receptors. Troglobites commonly do not survive well outside caves and, therefore, cannot travel between separate cave systems. As a result, many troglobiotic species are endemic to a single cave or system of caves.[2][3][4][5]\\r\\nNot all cave dwelling species are considered to be troglobite.

This makes it one of the oldest religions practiced today. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent through Central, East, and Southeast Asia. At one time or another, it influenced most of the Asian continent. The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements, schisms, and schools, among them the Theravda, Mahyna and Vajrayna traditions, with contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSiddhrtha Gautama was the historical founder of Buddhism. He was born a Kshatriya warrior prince in Lumbini, Shakya Republic, which was part of the Kosala realm of ancient India.[1] He is also known as the Shakyamuni (literally: \\"The sage of the Shakya clan\\").\\r\\nAfter an early life of luxury under the protection of his father, ?uddhodhana, the ruler of Kapilavasthu which later became incorporated into the state of Magadha, Siddhartha entered into contact with the realities of the world and concluded that life was inescapably bound up with suffering and sorrow. Siddhartha renounced his meaningless life of luxury to become an ascetic. He ultimately decided that asceticism couldn't end suffering, and instead chose a middle way, a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.\\r\\nUnder a fig tree, now known as the Bodhi tree, he vowed never to leave the position until he found Truth. At the age of 35, he attained Enlightenment. He was then known as Gautama Buddha, or simply \\"The Buddha\\", which means \\"the enlightened one\\", or \\"the awakened one\\".\\r\\nFor the remaining 45 years of his life, he traveled the Gangetic Plain of central India (the region of the Ganges/Ganga river and its tributaries), teaching his doctrine and discipline to a diverse range of people. By the time of his death, he had thousands of followers.\\r\\nThe Buddha's reluctance to name a successor or to formalise his doctrine led to the emergence of many movements during the next 400 years: first the schools of Nikaya Buddhism, of which only Theravada remains today, and then the formation of Mahayana and Vajrayana, pan-Buddhist sects based on the acceptance of new scriptures and the revision of older techniques.\\r\\nFollowers of Buddhism, called Buddhists in English, referred to themselves as Sakyan-s or Sakyabhiksu in ancient India.[2][3] Buddhist scholar Donald S. Lopez asserts they also used the term Bauddha,[4] although scholar Richard Cohen asserts that that term was used only by outsiders to describe Buddhists.[5]\\r\\nEarly Buddhism remained centered on the Ganges valley, spreading gradually from its ancient heartland. The canonical sources record two councils, where the monastic Sangha established the textual collections based on the Buddha's teachings and settled certain disciplinary problems within the community.\\r\\nThe first Buddhist council was held just after Buddha's Parinirvana, and presided over by Gupta Mahk?yapa, one of His most senior disciples, at Rjag?ha (today's Rajgir) during the 5th century under the noble support of king Ajtha?atru. The objective of the council was to record all of Buddha's teachings into the doctrinal teachings (sutra) and Abhidhamma and to codify the monastic rules (vinaya). nanda, one of the Buddha's main disciples and his cousin, was called upon to recite the discourses and Abhidhamma of the Buddha, and Upali, another disciple, recited the rules of the vinaya. These became the basis of the Tripi?aka (Three Baskets), which is preserved only in Pli.\\r\\nActual record on the first Buddhist Council did not mention the existence of the Abhidhamma. It existed only after the second Council.\\r\\nThe second Buddhist council was held at Vaisali following a dispute that had arisen in the Sa?gha over a relaxation by some monks of various points of discipline. Eventually it was decided to hold a second council at which the original Vinaya texts that had been preserved at the first Council were cited to show that these relaxations went against the recorded teachings of the Buddha.\\r\\nThe Mauryan Emperor A?oka (273ÿ232 BC) converted to Buddhism after his bloody conquest of the territory of Kalinga (modern Odisha) in eastern India during the Kalinga War. Regretting the horrors and misery brought about by the conflict, the king magnanimously decided to renounce violence, to replace the misery caused by war with respect and dignity for all humanity. He propagated the faith by building stupas and pillars urging, amongst other things, respect of all animal life and enjoining people to follow the Dharma. Perhaps the finest example of these is the Great Stupa of Sanchi, (near Bhopal, India). It was constructed in the 3rd century BC and later enlarged. Its carved gates, called toranas, are considered among the finest examples of Buddhist art in India. He also built roads, hospitals, resthouses, universities and irrigation systems around the country. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics or caste.\\r\\nThis period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India to other countries. According to the plates and pillars left by A?oka (the edicts of A?oka), emissaries were sent to various countries in order to spread Buddhism, as far south as Sri Lanka and as far west as the Greek kingdoms, in particular the neighboring Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and possibly even farther to the Mediterranean.\\r\\nKing A?oka convened the third Buddhist council around 250 BC at Pataliputra (today's Patna). It was held by the monk Moggaliputtatissa. The objective of the council was to purify the Sa?gha, particularly from non-Buddhist ascetics who had been attracted by the royal patronage. Following the council, Buddhist missionaries were dispatched throughout the known world.\\r\\nSome of the edicts of A?oka describe the efforts made by him to propagate the Buddhist faith throughout the Hellenistic world, which at that time formed an uninterrupted continuum from the borders of India to Greece. The edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and locations of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist proselytism: Antiochus II Theos of the Seleucid Kingdom (261ÿ246 BC), Ptolemy II Philadelphos of Egypt (285ÿ247 BC), Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia (276ÿ239 BC), Magas (288ÿ258 BC) in Cyrenaica (modern Libya), and Alexander II (272ÿ255 BC) in Epirus (modern Northwestern Greece).\\r\\nFurthermore, according to Pli sources, some of A?oka's emissaries were Greek Buddhist monks, indicating close religious exchanges between the two cultures:\\r\\nA?oka also issued edicts in the Greek language as well as in Aramaic. One of them, found in Kandahar, advocates the adoption of \\"piety\\" (using the Greek term eusebeia for Dharma) to the Greek community:\\r\\nIt is not clear how much these interactions may have been influential, but some authors[citation needed] have commented that some level of syncretism between Hellenist thought and Buddhism may have started in Hellenic lands at that time. They have pointed to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in Alexandria (mentioned by Clement of Alexandria), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the Therapeutae (possibly a deformation of the Pli word \\"Theravda\\"[7]), who may have \\"almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism\\"[8] and may even have been descendants of A?oka's emissaries to the West.[9] The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene, from the city of Cyrene where Magas of Cyrene ruled, is sometimes thought to have been influenced by the teachings of A?oka's Buddhist missionaries.[10]\\r\\nBuddhist gravestones from the Ptolemaic period have also been found in Alexandria, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel.[11] The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria has even drawn the conclusion: \\"It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established\\".[12]\\r\\nIn the 2nd century AD, the Christian dogmatist, Clement of Alexandria recognized Bactrian Buddhists (?ramanas) and Indian gymnosophists for their influence on Greek thought:\\r\\nSri Lanka was proselytized by A?oka's son Mahinda and six companions during the 2nd century BC. They converted the King Devanampiya Tissa and many of the nobility. In addition, A?oka's daughter, Sa?ghamitta also established the bhikkhunؐ (order for nuns) in Sri Lanka, also bringing with her a sapling of the sacred bodhi tree that was subsequently planted in Anuradhapura. This is when the Mahvihra monastery, a center of Sinhalese orthodoxy, was built. The Pli canon was written down in Sri Lanka during the reign of king Vattagamani (29ÿ17 BC), and the Theravda tradition flourished there. Later some great commentators worked there, such as Buddhagho?a (4thÿ5th century) and Dhammapla (5thÿ6th century), and they systemised the traditional commentaries that had been handed down. Although Mahyna Buddhism gained some influence in Sri Lanka at that time, the Theravda ultimately prevailed and Sri Lanka turned out to be the last stronghold of it. From there it would expand again to South-East Asia from the 11th century.\\r\\nIn the areas east of the Indian subcontinent (modern Burma and Thailand), Indian culture strongly influenced the Mons. The Mons are said to have been converted to Buddhism from the 3rd century BC under the proselytizing of the Indian Emperor A?oka, before the fission between Mahyna and Hinayna Buddhism. Early Mon[citation needed] Buddhist temples, such as Peikthano in central Burma, have been dated to between the 1st and the 5th century CE.\\r\\nThe Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the Gupta and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in South-East Asia following the expansion of the Mon kingdom between the 5th and 8th centuries. The Theravda faith expanded in the northern parts of Southeast Asia under Mon influence, until it was progressively displaced by Mahyna Buddhism from around the 6th century AD.\\r\\nAccording to the A?okvadna (2nd century AD), A?oka sent a missionary to the north, through the Himalayas, to Khotan in the Tarim Basin, then the land of the Tocharians, speakers of an Indo-European language.\\r\\nThe Shunga dynasty (185ÿ73 BC) was established in 185 BC, about 50 years after A?oka's death. After assassinating King Brhadrata (last of the Mauryan rulers), military commander-in-chief Pushyamitra Shunga took the throne. Buddhist religious scriptures such as the A?okvadna allege that Pushyamitra (an orthodox Brahmin) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhists wrote that he \\"destroyed hundreds of monasteries and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks\\":[14] 840,000 Buddhist stupas which had been built by A?oka were destroyed, and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk.[15] In addition, Buddhist sources allege that a large number of Buddhist monasteries (vihras) were converted to Hindu temples, in places like, but not limited to, Nalanda, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Mathura, among many others.\\r\\nModern historians, however, dispute this view in the light of literary and archaeological evidence. They opine that following A?oka's sponsorship of Buddhism, it is possible that Buddhist institutions fell on harder times under the Shungas, but no evidence of active persecution has been noted. Etienne Lamotte observes: \\"To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof.\\"[16] Another eminent historian, Romila Thapar points to archaeological evidence that \\"suggests the contrary\\" to the claim that \\"Pushyamitra was a fanatical anti-Buddhist\\" and that he \\"never actually destroyed 840,000 stupas as claimed by Buddhist works, if any\\". Thapar stresses that Buddhist accounts are probably hyperbolic renditions of Pushyamitra's attack of the Mauryas, and merely reflect the desperate frustration of the Buddhist religious figures in the face of the possibly irreversible decline in the importance of their religion under the Shungas.[17]\\r\\nDuring the period, Buddhist monks deserted the Ganges valley, following either the northern road (uttarapatha) or the southern road (dak?inapatha).[18] Conversely, Buddhist artistic creation stopped in the old Magadha area, to reposition itself either in the northwest area of Gandhra and Mathura or in the southeast around Amaravati. Some artistic activity also occurred in central India, as in Bhrhut, to which the Shungas may or may not have contributed.\\r\\nAt the start of the Silk Road in the crossroads between India and China (modern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and Tajikistan) Greek kingdoms had been in place since the time of the conquests of Alexander the Great around 326 BC and continued for over 300 years: first the Seleucids from around 323 BC, then the Greco-Bactrian kingdom from around 250 BC and finally the Indo-Greek Kingdom, lasting until 10 CE.\\r\\nThe Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius I invaded the Indian Subcontinent in 180 BC, establishing an Indo-Greek kingdom that was to last in parts of Northwest South Asia until the end of the 1st century CE. Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek and Greco-Bactrian kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the Mauryan empire and to protect the Buddhist faith from the alleged religious persecutions of the Shungas (185ÿ73 BC).\\r\\nOne of the most famous Indo-Greek kings is Menander (reigned c. 160ÿ135 BC). He converted to Buddhism and is presented in the Mahyna tradition as one of the great benefactors of the faith, on a par with king A?oka or the later Kushan king Kani?ka. Menander's coins bear the mention of the \\"saviour king\\" in Greek; some bear designs of the eight-spoked wheel. Direct cultural exchange is also suggested by the dialogue of the Milinda Pa?ha around 160 BC between Menander and the Buddhist monk Ngasena, who was himself a student of the Greek Buddhist monk Mahadharmaraksita. Upon Menander's death, the honor of sharing his remains was claimed by the cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in stupas, in a parallel with the historic Buddha.[19] Several of Menander's Indo-Greek successors inscribed \\"Follower of the Dharma,\\" in the Kharo??hؐ script, on their coins, and depicted themselves or their divinities forming the vitarka mudr.\\r\\nIt is also around the time of initial Greek and Buddhist interaction that the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha are found, often in realistic Greco-Buddhist style. The former reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddhas sayings, reported in the Digha Nikaya, that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.[20] Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of \\"their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha\\".[21][page?needed] In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop syncretic divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is the syncretic God Sarapis, introduced by Ptolemy I in Egypt, which combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek God-King (The Sun-God Apollo, or possibly the deified founder of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, Demetrius), with the traditional attributes of the Buddha. Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the Greco-Roman toga-like wavy robe covering both shoulders (more exactly, its lighter version, the Greek himation), the contrapposto stance of the upright figures (see: 1stÿ2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas[22]), the stylicized Mediterranean curly hair and topknot (ushnisha) apparently derived from the style of the Belvedere Apollo (330 BCE),[23] and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism (See: Greek art). A large quantity of sculptures combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and iconography were excavated at the Gandharan site of Hadda.\\r\\nSeveral influential Greek Buddhist monks are recorded. Mahadharmaraksita (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma'), was \\"a Greek (\\"Yona\\") Buddhist head monk\\", according to the Mahavamsa (Chap. XXIX[24]), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \\"the Greek city of Alasandra\\" (Alexandria of the Caucasus, around 150?km north of today's Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Great Stupa in Anuradhapura during the rule (165 BC - 135 BC) of King Menander I. Dharmaraksita (Sanskrit), or Dhammarakkhita (Pali) (translation: Protected by the Dharma), was one of the missionaries sent by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to proselytize the Buddhist faith. He is described as being a Greek (Pali: \\"Yona\\", lit. \\"Ionian\\") in the Mahavamsa.\\r\\nA Buddhist gold coin from India was found in northern Afghanistan at the archaeological site of Tillia Tepe, and dated to the 1st century AD. On the reverse, it depicts a lion in the moving position with a nandipada in front of it, with the Kharo??hؐ legend \\"Sih[o] vigatabhay[o]\\" (\\"The lion who dispelled fear\\").\\r\\nThe Mahayana Buddhists symbolized Buddha with animals such as a lion, an elephant, a horse or a bull. A pair of feet was also used. The symbol called nandipada by archaeologists and historians is actually a composite symbol. The symbol at the top symbolizes the \\"Middle Path\\", the Buddha dhamma. The circle with a centre symbolizes cakka. Thus, the composite symbol symbolizes dhammacakka, the Buddhist Wheel of the Law. Thus, the symbols on the reverse of the coin jointly symbolize Buddha rolling the dhammacakka. In the \\"Lion Capital\\" of Saranath, India, Buddha rolling the dhammacakka is depicted on the wall of the cylinder with lion, elephant, horse and bull rolling the dhammacakkas. On the obverse, an almost naked man only wearing an Hellenistic chlamys and wearing a head-dress rolls a dhammacakka. The legend in Kharo??hؐ reads \\"Dharmacakrapravata[ko]\\" (\\"The one who turned the Wheel of the Law\\"). It has been suggested that this may be an early representation of the Buddha.[25]\\r\\nThe head-dress symbolizes the \\"Middle Path\\". Thus, the man with the head-dress is a person who adheres to the Middle Path. (In one of the Indus Valley seals, we find a similar head-dress worn by 9 women.)\\r\\nThus, on both sides of the coin, we find Buddha rolling the dhammacakka.\\r\\nAs no scientific study on literary and physical symbolization of Buddha and Buddhism was conducted by the archaeologists and historians, imaginary and false interpretations were only given on coins, seals, Brahmi and other inscriptions and other archaeological finds.\\r\\nSeveral scholars have suggested that the Praj?pramit stras, which are among the earliest Mahyna stras,[26][27] developed among the Mahs?ghika along the K???a River in the ndhra region of South India.[28]\\r\\nThe earliest Mahyna stras to include the very first versions of the Praj?pramit genre, along with texts concerning Ak?obhya Buddha, which were probably written down in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.[29][30] Guang Xing states, \\"Several scholars have suggested that the Praj?pramit probably developed among the Mahs?ghikas in southern India, in the ndhra country, on the K???a River.\\"[31] A.K. Warder believes that \\"the Mahyna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the ndhra country.\\"[32]\\r\\nAnthony Barber and Sree Padma note that \\"historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as Ngrjuna, Dignaga, Candrakؐrti, ryadeva, and Bhavaviveka, among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in ndhra.\\"[33] They note that the ancient Buddhist sites in the lower K???a Valley, including Amaravati, Ngrjunako?? and Jaggayyape?a \\"can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.\\"[34] Akira Hirakawa notes the \\"evidence suggests that many Early Mahayana scriptures originated in South India.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe Fourth Council is said to have been convened in the reign of the Kashmir emperor Kani?ka around 100 AD at Jalandhar or in Kashmir. Theravda Buddhism had its own Fourth Council in Sri Lanka about 200 years earlier in which the Pli canon was written down in toto for the first time. Therefore, there were two Fourth Councils: one in Sri Lanka (Theravda), and one in Kashmir (Sarvstivdin).\\r\\nIt is said that for the Fourth Council of Kashmir, Kani?ka gathered 500 monks headed by Vasumitra, partly, it seems, to compile extensive commentaries on the Abhidharma, although it is possible that some editorial work was carried out upon the existing canon itself. Allegedly during the council there were altogether three hundred thousand verses and over nine million statements compiled, and it took twelve years to complete. The main fruit of this council was the compilation of the vast commentary known as the Mah-Vibhsh (\\"Great Exegesis\\"), an extensive compendium and reference work on a portion of the Sarvstivdin Abhidharma.\\r\\nScholars believe that it was also around this time that a significant change was made in the language of the Sarvstivdin canon, by converting an earlier Prakrit version into Sanskrit. Although this change was probably effected without significant loss of integrity to the canon, this event was of particular significance since Sanskrit was the sacred language of Brahmanism in India, and was also being used by other thinkers, regardless of their specific religious or philosophical allegiance, thus enabling a far wider audience to gain access to Buddhist ideas and practices. For this reason there was a growing tendency among Buddhist scholars in India thereafter to write their commentaries and treatises in Sanskrit. Many of the early schools, however, such as Theravda, never switched to Sanskrit, partly because Buddha explicitly forbade translation of his discourses into what was an elitist religious language (as Latin was in medieval Europe). He wanted his monks to use a local language instead - a language which could be understood by all. Over time, however, the language of the Theravdin scriptures (Pli) became a scholarly or elitist language as well, exactly opposite to what the Buddha had explicitly commanded.\\r\\nFrom that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mahyna was to flourish and spread in the East from India to South-East Asia, and towards the north to Central Asia, China, Korea, and finally to Japan in 538 AD and Tibet in the 7th century.\\r\\nAfter the end of the Kushans, Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the Guptas (4th-6th century). Mahyna centers of learning were established, especially at Nland in north-eastern India, which was to become the largest and most influential Buddhist university for many centuries, with famous teachers such as Ngrjuna. The influence of the Gupta style of Buddhist art spread along with the faith from south-east Asia to China.\\r\\nIndian Buddhism had weakened in the 6th century following the White Hun invasions and Mihirakula's persecution.\\r\\nXuanzang reported in his travels across India during the 7th century, of Buddhism being popular in Andhra, Dhanyakataka and Dravida, which area today roughly corresponds to the modern day Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.[36] While reporting many deserted stupas in the area around modern day Nepal and the persecution of Buddhists by Shashanka in the Kingdom of Gauda in modern-day West Bengal, Xuanzang complimented the patronage of Har?avardana during the same period. After the Har?avardana kingdom, the rise of many small kingdoms that led to the rise of the Rajputs across the gangetic plains and marked the end of Buddhist ruling clans along with a sharp decline in royal patronage until a revival under the Pla Empire in the Bengal region. Here Mahyna Buddhism flourished and spread to Tibet, Bhutan and Sikkim between the 7th and the 12th centuries before the Plas collapsed under the assault of the Hindu Sena dynasty. The Plas created many temples and a distinctive school of Buddhist art. Xuanzang noted in his travels that in various regions Buddhism was giving way to Jainism and Hinduism.[37] By the 10th century Buddhism had experienced a sharp decline beyond the Pla realms in Bengal under a resurgent Hinduism and the incorporation in Vaishnavite Hinduism of Buddha as the 9th incarnation of Vishnu.[38]\\r\\nA milestone in the decline of Indian Buddhism in the North occurred in 1193 when Turkic Islamic raiders under Muhammad Khilji burnt Nland. By the end of the 12th century, following the Islamic conquest of the Buddhist strongholds in Bihar and the loss of political support coupled with social pressures, the practice of Buddhism retreated to the Himalayan foothills in the North and Sri Lanka in the south. Additionally, the influence of Buddhism also waned due to Hinduism's revival movements such as Advaita, the rise of the bhakti movement and the missionary work of Sufis.\\r\\nCentral Asia had been influenced by Buddhism probably almost since the time of the Buddha. According to a legend preserved in Pli, the language of the Theravdin canon, two merchant brothers from Bactria named Tapassu and Bhallika visited the Buddha and became his disciples. They then returned to Bactria and built temples to the Buddha.[39]\\r\\nCentral Asia long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and Persia. During the 2nd century BC, the expansion of the Former Han to the west brought them into contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the Greco-Bactrian Kingdoms. Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the north led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oases of Central Asia. Some Silk Road cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between east and west.\\r\\nThe Theravdin traditions first spread among the Iranian tribes before combining with the Mahyna forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC to cover modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. These were the ancient states of Gandhra, Bactria, Margiana and Sogdia, from where it spread to China. Among the first of these states to come under the influence of Buddhism was Bactria as early as the 3rd century BC (see Greco-Buddhism). It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also Zoroastrians, Hindus, Nestorian Christians, Jews, Manichaeans, and followers of shamanism, Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief.\\r\\nVarious Nikya schools persisted in Central Asia and China until around the 7th century AD. Mahyna started to become dominant during the period, but since the faith had not developed a Nikaya approach, Sarvstivdins and Dharmaguptakas remained the Vinayas of choice in Central Asian monasteries.\\r\\nVarious Buddhist kingdoms rose and prospered in both the Central Asian region and downwards into the Indian sub-continent, such as the Kushan Empire, prior to the White Hun invasion in the 5th century, where under the King Mihirakula they were heavily persecuted.\\r\\nBuddhism in Central Asia started to decline with the expansion of Islam and the destruction of many stupas in war from the 7th century. The Muslims accorded them the status of dhimmis as \\"people of the Book\\", such as Christianity or Judaism, and Al-Biruni wrote of Buddha as prophet \\"burxan\\".\\r\\nBuddhism saw a surge during the reign of Mongols following the invasion of Genghis Khan and the establishment of the Il Khanate and the Chagatai Khanate who brought their Buddhist influence with them during the 13th century; however, within 100 years the Mongols who remained in that region would convert to Islam and spread Islam across all the regions of central Asia. Only the eastern Mongols and the Mongols of the Yuan dynasty would keep Vajrayna Buddhism.\\r\\nBuddhism expanded westward into the easternmost fringes of Arsacid Parthia, to the area of Merv, in ancient Margiana, today's territory of Turkmenistan. Soviet archeological teams have excavated in Giaur Kala near Merv a Buddhist chapel, a gigantic Buddha statue and a monastery.\\r\\nParthians were directly involved in the propagation of Buddhism: An Shigao (c. 148 AD), a Parthian prince, went to China, and is the first known translator of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.\\r\\nThe eastern part of central Asia (Chinese Turkestan, Tarim Basin, Xinjiang) has revealed extremely rich Buddhist works of art (wall paintings and reliefs in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Serindian art is highly reminiscent of the Gandhran style, and scriptures in the Gandhri script Kharo??hؐ have been found.\\r\\nCentral Asians seem to have played a key role in the transmission of Buddhism to the East. The first translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were Parthian (Ch: Anxi) like An Shigao (c. 148 AD) or An Hsuan, Kushan of Yuezhi ethnicity like Lokaksema (c. 178 AD), Zhi Qian and Zhi Yao or Sogdians like Kang Sengkai. Thirty-seven early translators of Buddhist texts are known, and the majority of them have been identified as Central Asians.\\r\\nCentral Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as shown by frescoes from the Tarim Basin.\\r\\nThese influences were rapidly absorbed, however, by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.\\r\\nAccording to traditional accounts, Buddhism was introduced in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) after an emperor dreamed of a flying golden man thought to be the Buddha. Although the archaeological record confirms that Buddhism was introduced sometime during the Han dynasty, it did not flourish in China until the Six Dynasties period (220-589 AD).[43]\\r\\nThe year 67 AD saw Buddhism's official introduction to China with the coming of the two monks Moton and Chufarlan. In 68 AD, under imperial patronage, they established the White Horse Temple (), which still exists today, close to the imperial capital at Luoyang. By the end of the 2nd century, a prosperous community had settled at Pengcheng (modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu).\\r\\nThe first known Mahyna scriptural texts are translations into Chinese by the Kushan monk Lokak?ema in Luoyang, between 178 and 189 AD. Some of the earliest known Buddhist artifacts found in China are small statues on \\"money trees\\", dated c. 200 AD, in typical Gandhran drawing style: \\"That the imported images accompanying the newly arrived doctrine came from Gandhra is strongly suggested by such early Gandhra characteristics on this \\"money tree\\" Buddha as the high u?ni?a, vertical arrangement of the hair, moustache, symmetrically looped robe and parallel incisions for the folds of the arms.\\"[44]\\r\\nIn the period between 460-525 AD during the Northern Wei dynasty, the Chinese constructed Yungang Grottoes, and it's an outstanding example of the Chinese stone carvings from the 5th and 6th centuries. All together the site is composed of 252 grottoes with more than 51,000 Buddha statues and statuettes.\\r\\nAnother famous Buddhism Grottoes is Longmen Grottoes which started with the Northern Wei Dynasty in 493 AD. There are as many as 100,000 statues within the 1,400 caves, ranging from an 1 inch (25 mm) to 57 feet (17 m) in height. The area also contains nearly 2,500 stelae and inscriptions, whence the name \\"Forest of Ancient Stelae\\", as well as over sixty Buddhist pagodas.\\r\\nBuddhism flourished during the beginning of the Tang Dynasty (618ÿ907). The dynasty was initially characterized by a strong openness to foreign influences and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India from the 4th to the 11th centuries. The Tang capital of Chang'an (today's Xi'an) became an important center for Buddhist thought. From there Buddhism spread to Korea, and Japanese embassies of Kentoshi helped gain footholds in Japan.\\r\\nHowever, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived towards the end of the Tang Dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor Wuzong outlawed all \\"foreign\\" religions including Christian Nestorianism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism in order to support the indigenous Taoism. Throughout his territory, he confiscated Buddhist possessions, destroyed monasteries and temples, and executed Buddhist monks, ending Buddhism's cultural and intellectual dominance.\\r\\nHowever, about a hundred years after the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, Buddhism revived during the Song Dynasty (1127ÿ1279).\\r\\nPure Land and Chan Buddhism, however, continued to prosper for some centuries, the latter giving rise to Japanese Zen. In China, Chan flourished particularly under the Song dynasty (1127ÿ1279), when its monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.\\r\\nIn the last two thousand years, the Buddhist have built The Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism, they are Mount Wutai, Mount Emei, Mount Jiuhua, Mount Putuo.\\r\\nToday, China boasts one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts and heritages in the world. UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang in Gansu province, the Longmen Grottoes near Luoyang in Henan province, the Yungang Grottoes near Datong in Shanxi province, and the Dazu Rock Carvings near Chongqing are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The Leshan Giant Buddha, carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.\\r\\nBuddhism was introduced around 372 AD, when Chinese ambassadors visited the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, bringing scriptures and images. Buddhism prospered in Korea - in particular Seon (Zen) Buddhism from the 7th century onward. However, with the beginning of the Confucian Yi Dynasty of the Joseon period in 1392, a strong discrimination took place against Buddhism until it was almost completely eradicated, except for a remaining Seon movement.\\r\\nThe Buddhism of Japan was introduced from Three Kingdoms of Korea in the 6th century. The Chinese priest Ganjin offered the system of Vinaya to the Buddhism of Japan in 754. As a result, the Buddhism of Japan has developed rapidly. Saich and Kkai succeeded to a legitimate Buddhism from China in the 9th century.\\r\\nBeing geographically at the end of the Silk Road, Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.\\r\\nThe Buddhism quickly became a national religion and thrived, particularly under Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku) during Asuka period (538-794). From 710, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of Nara, such as the five-story pagoda and Golden Hall of the Hry-ji, or the Kfuku-ji temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. The creations of Japanese Buddhist art were especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during Nara period(710-794), Heian period(794-1185) and Kamakura period(1185-1333).\\r\\nDuring Kamakura period, major reformation activities started, namely changing from Buddhism for the imperial court to the Buddhism for the common people. The traditional Buddhism mostly focused on the protection of the country, imperial house or noble families from the ill spirits and salvation of the imperial families, nobles and monks themselves (self-salvation). On the other hand, new sects such as Jodo shu (pure land sect) founded by Honen and Jodo Shinshu (true pure land sect) founded by Shinran, Honen's disciple, emphasized salvation of sinners, common men and women and even criminals such as murderers of parents. Shinran preached the commoners by teaching that saying nembutsu (prayer of Amida Buddha) is a declaration of faith in Amida's salvation. Also for the first time in the history of Buddhism, Shinran started a new sect allowing marriage of monks by initiating his own marriage, which was deemed as taboo from the traditional Buddhism.\\r\\nAnother development in Kamakura period was Zen, by the introduction of the faith by Dogen and Eisai upon their return from China. Zen is highly philosophical with simplified words reflecting deep thought, but, in the art history, it is mainly characterized by so-called zen art, original paintings (such as ink wash and the Enso) and poetry (especially haikus), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned \\"non-dualistic\\" representations. The search for enlightenment \\"in the moment\\" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the Chanoyu tea ceremony or the Ikebana art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques (martial arts).\\r\\nBuddhism remains active in Japan to this day. Around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved and regularly restored.\\r\\nBuddhism arrived late in Tibet, during the 7th century. The form that predominated, via the south of Tibet, was a blend of mahyna and vajrayna from the universities of the Pla empire of the Bengal region in eastern India.[45] Sarvstivdin influence came from the south west (Kashmir)[46] and the north west (Khotan).[47] Although these practitioners did not succeed in maintaining a presence in Tibet, their texts found their way into the Tibetan Buddhist canon, providing the Tibetans with almost all of their primary sources about the Foundation Vehicle. A subsect of this school, Mlasarvstivda was the source of the Tibetan Vinaya.[48] Chan Buddhism was introduced via east Tibet from China and left its impression, but was rendered of lesser importance by early political events.[49]\\r\\nFrom the outset Buddhism was opposed by the native shamanistic Bon religion, which had the support of the aristocracy, but with royal patronage it thrived to a peak under King R?lpach?n (817-836). Terminology in translation was standardised around 825, enabling a translation methodology that was highly literal. Despite a reversal in Buddhist influence which began under King Langdarma (836-842), the following centuries saw a colossal effort in collecting available Indian sources, many of which are now extant only in Tibetan translation. Tibetan Buddhism was favored above other religions by the rulers of imperial Chinese and Mongol Yuan Dynasty (1271ÿ1368).\\r\\nDuring the 1st century AD, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise in the Middle-East of the Parthian empire, an unvanquished enemy of Rome, just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the Mediterranean and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connection, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence Southeast Asian countries (excluding Vietnam). Trade routes linked India with southern Burma, central and southern Siam, islands of Sumatra and Java, lower Cambodia and Champa, and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.\\r\\nFor more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The Pli and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with Theravda and Mahyna Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Hinduism, were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the Rmya?a and the Mahbhrata.\\r\\nFrom the 5th to the 13th centuries, South-East Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The main Buddhist influence now came directly by sea from the Indian subcontinent, so that these empires essentially followed the Mahyna faith. The Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence, and their art expressed the rich Mahyna pantheon of the bodhisattvas.\\r\\nSrivijaya, a maritime empire centered at Palembang on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, adopted Mahyna and Vajrayna Buddhism under a line of rulers named the Sailendras. Yijing described Palembang as a great center of Buddhist learning where the emperor supported over a thousand monks at his court. Yijing also testified to the importance of Buddhism as early as the year 671 and advised future Chinese pilgrims to spend a year or two in Palembang.[50] Ati?a studied there before travelling to Tibet as a missionary.\\r\\nAs Srivijaya expanded their thalassocracy, Buddhism thrived amongst its people. However, many did not practice pure Buddhism but a new syncretism form of Buddhism that incorporated several different religions such as Hinduism and other indigenous traditions.[51]\\r\\nSrivijaya spread Buddhist art during its expansion in Southeast Asia. Numerous statues of bodhisattvas from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. Extremely rich architectural remains are visible at the temple of Borobudur the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built from around 780 in Java, which has 505 images of the seated Buddha. Srivijaya declined due to conflicts with the Hindu Chola rulers of India, before being destabilized by the Islamic expansion from the 13th century.\\r\\nLater, from the 9th to the 13th centuries, the Mahyna Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. Angkor was at the center of this development, with a temple complex and urban organization able to support around one million urban dwellers. One of the greatest Khmer kings, Jayavarman VII (1181ÿ1219), built large Mahyna Buddhist structures at Bayon and Angkor Thom.\\r\\nBuddhism in Vietnam as practiced by the Vietnamese is mainly of Mahyna tradition. Buddhism came from Vietnam as early as the 2nd century AD through the North from Central Asia via India. Vietnamese Buddhism is very similar to Chinese Buddhism and to some extent reflects the structure of Chinese Buddhism after the Song Dynasty. Vietnamese Buddhism also has a symbiotic relationship with Taoism, Chinese spirituality and the native Vietnamese religion.\\r\\nVarious classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism.[52] The Ma?jusrimulakalpa, which later came to classified under Kriyatantra, states that mantras taught in the Shaiva, Garuda and Vaishnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri.[53] The Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Shaiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas.[54] The Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Shaiva text Tantrasadbhava, introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.[55]\\r\\nFrom the 11th century, the destruction of Buddhism in the Indian mainland by Islamic invasions led to the decline of the Mahyna faith in South-East Asia. Continental routes through the Indian subcontinent being compromised, direct sea routes developed from the Middle-East through Sri Lanka to China, leading to the adoption of the Theravda Buddhism of the Pli canon, introduced to the region around the 11th century from Sri Lanka.\\r\\nKing Anawrahta (1044ÿ1078); the founder of the Pagan Empire, unified the country and adopted the Theravdin Buddhist faith. This initiated the creation of thousands of Buddhist temples at Pagan, the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries. Around 2,200 of them are still standing. The power of the Burmese waned with the rise of the Thai, and with the seizure of the capital Pagan by the Mongols in 1287, but Theravda Buddhism remained the main Burmese faith to this day.\\r\\nThe Theravda faith was also adopted by the newly founded ethnic Thai kingdom of Sukhothai around 1260. Theravda Buddhism was further reinforced during the Ayutthaya period (14thÿ18th century), becoming an integral part of Thai society.\\r\\nIn the continental areas, Theravda Buddhism continued to expand into Laos and Cambodia in the 13th century. From the 14th century, however, on the coastal fringes and in the islands of south-east Asia, the influence of Islam proved stronger, expanding into Malaysia, Indonesia, and most of the islands as far as the southern Philippines.\\r\\nNevertheless, since Suharto's rise to power in 1966, there has been a remarkable renaissance of Buddhism in Indonesia. This is partly due to the requirements of Suharto's New Order for the people of Indonesia to adopt one of the five official religions: Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism or Buddhism. Today it is estimated there are some 10 million Buddhists in Indonesia. A large part of them are people of Chinese ancestry.\\r\\nAfter the Classical encounters between Buddhism and the West recorded in Greco-Buddhist art, information and legends about Buddhism seem to have reached the West sporadically. An account of Buddha's life was translated into Greek by John of Damascus, and widely circulated to Christians as the story of Barlaam and Josaphat. By the 14th century this story of Josaphat had become so popular that he was made a Catholic saint.\\r\\nThe next direct encounter between Europeans and Buddhism happened in Medieval times when the Franciscan friar William of Rubruck was sent on an embassy to the Mongol court of Mongke by the French king Saint Louis in 1253. The contact happened in Cailac (today's Qayaliq in Kazakhstan), and William originally thought they were wayward Christians (Foltz, \\"Religions of the Silk Road\\").\\r\\nIn the period after Hulagu, the Mongol Ilkhans increasingly adopted Buddhism. Numerous Buddhist temples dotted the landscape of Persia and Iraq, none of which survived the 14th century. The Buddhist element of the Il-Khanate died with Arghun.[56]\\r\\nThe Kalmyk Khanate was founded in the 17th century with Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, following the earlier migration of the Oirats from Dzungaria through Central Asia to the steppe around the mouth of the Volga River. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the Russian Empire.[57] At the end of the Napoleonic wars, Kalmyk cavalry units in Russian service entered Paris.[58]\\r\\nInterest in Buddhism increased during the colonial era, when Western powers were in a position to witness the faith and its artistic manifestations in detail. The opening of Japan in 1853 created a considerable interest in the arts and culture of Japan, and provided access to one of the most thriving Buddhist cultures in the world.\\r\\nBuddhism started to enjoy a strong interest from the general population in the West following the turbulence of the 20th century. In the wake of the 1959 Tibetan uprising, a Tibetan diaspora has made Tibetan Buddhism in particular more widely accessible to the rest of the world. It has since spread to many Western countries, where the tradition has gained popularity. Among its prominent exponents is the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. The number of its adherents is estimated to be between ten and twenty million.[59]","input":"Who was the founder of buddhism and when was it founded?"},{"output":"310.29 metric tonnes","context":"The gold reserve of the United Kingdom is the amount of gold kept by Bank of England as a store of value of part of the United Kingdom's wealth.

After France was invaded by Nazi Germany, fear of Britain also suffering the same fate led to most of the country's gold being relocated under a secret operation known as Operation Fish. In May 1940, under order of the UK Government; 280 tonnes of the nation's gold was transported from the Bank of England in London up to Martins' Bank in Liverpool ready to be shipped to Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the war in 1945, Britain was estimated to have reserves in excess of 1772.94 tonnes, however, with incomplete records; the figure may have been higher.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n In May 1999, then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced plans to sell off 415 tonnes of gold in order to diversify the country's reserves owing to the volatile value of gold.[4] The first series of sales amounting to 125 tonnes took place in the year 2000 across five auctions with each selling 25 tonnes.[5] By the end of 2002, UK gold reserves dropped to 355.25 tonnes while at the same time the value of gold increased dramatically leading to an estimated loss of S2,000,000,000 from the gold sold.[6]","input":"How many tons of gold does the uk have?"},{"output":"unification of the German territories","context":"Blood and Iron (German: Blut und Eisen) is the name given to a speech made by Otto von Bismarck given on 30 September 1862, at the time when he was Minister President of Prussia, about the unification of the German territories. It is also a transposed phrase that Bismarck uttered near the end of the speech that has become one of his most widely known quotations.\\r\\nIn September 1862, when the Prussian House of Representatives was refusing to approve an increase in military spending desired by King Wilhelm I, the monarch appointed Bismarck Minister President and Foreign Minister. A few days later, Bismarck appeared before the House's Budget Committee and stressed the need for military preparedness to solve the German Question. He concluded his speech with the following statement:[1] \\"The position of Prussia in Germany will not be determined by its liberalism but by its power [...] Prussia must concentrate its strength and hold it for the favorable moment, which has already come and gone several times. Since the treaties of Vienna, our frontiers have been ill-designed for a healthy body politic. Not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decidedthat was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849but by iron and blood (Eisen und Blut).\\" This phrase, relying on a patriotic poem written by Max von Schenkendorf during the Napoleonic Wars, was popularized as the more euphonious Blut und Eisen (\\"Blood and Iron\\"), and became symbolic of Bismarckian Machtpolitik (\\"Power politics\\").\\r\\nAlthough Bismarck was an outstanding diplomat, the phrase \\"blood and iron\\" has become a popular description of his foreign policy partly because he did on occasion resort to war to further the unification of Germany and the expansion of its continental power.

It was transferred to Sacramento County in 2000, as part of its conversion into McClellan Business Park, and was purchased by McClellan Business Park in October 2017. The airport is a public-use facility which operates as an uncontrolled airfield in what the FAA designates as Class \\"E\\" Airspace. The airport is mainly used for general aviation. Current airport tenants include Calstar, the California Department of Forestry, United States Coast Guard, Air Station Sacramento, Dassault Falcon, United States Forest Service, PODS, and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District. All ground handling and fueling is completed by McClellan Jet Services, a subsidiary of McClellan Business Park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air force base was established in 1935. It was named after Major Hezekiah McClellan on 1 December 1939, a pioneer in arctic aeronautical tests. Born in 1894, he died on 25 May 1936 when his Consolidated P-30 which he was flight testing, crashed near Centerville, Ohio.\\r\\nConstruction of the Pacific Air Depot began in 1935, and the main structures, including administrative buildings, barracks, warehouses and a hospital were completed on 18 April 1938. In 1938 the base was renamed Sacramento Air Depot and underwent a major expansion as a repair and overhaul facility for P-38 and P-39 fighter planes.\\r\\nIn December 1941, soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, P-40s as well as Martin B-26 Marauder and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers began arriving at the field to be armed and prepared for immediate shipment overseas. In March 1942 Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle's B-25s arrived at McClellan for arming in preparation for their famous Tokyo raid.\\r\\nThe base was renamed McClellan Air Force Base in 1948 and its repair and overhaul mission continued throughout the Cold War as an installation of the Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and later the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), with the overhaul facility being known as the Sacramento Air Logistics Center.\\r\\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, McClellan functioned as the main depot for overhauling the Air Force's F-111, FB-111 and EF-111 aircraft, as well as the Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. A small contingent of F-111D and F-111F aircraft of the 431st Test and Evaluation Squadron, 57th Fighter Weapons Wing, Nellis AFB, Nevada was also detached to McClellan.\\r\\nMcClellan Airfield has one concrete paved runway (16/34) measuring 10,600 x 150?ft.

By the 1980s, skiwear was added, followed by camping equipment. Today The North Face offers many product categories from athletic clothing to more casual sportswear, though they are best known for insulated jackets.\\r\\nThe North Face is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the VF Corporation.[5] It is headquartered in Alameda, California, co-located with its corporate sibling, JanSport.[6] In 2007, JanSport was the world's largest backpack manufacturer; combined, the two manufactured nearly half of all small backpacks sold in the United States.[6]\\r\\nThe North Face's quarter-circle logo, produced by California designer David Alcorn in 1971, evokes Half Dome, a massive granitic monolith in Yosemite National Park.[4] The North Face maintains strong links with the outdoor community through sponsoring athletes, including Lizzy Hawker, winner of the Ultra Trail Tour du Mont Blanc in 2005, 2008 and 2010.[7]\\r\\nNorth Face attire has grown in popularity.[8] The rise in the popularity of the North Face attire has resulted in wearers of the line becoming the targets of robbery.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[2] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\n\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.  Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland.  \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015).  Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction  ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[10] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999.  This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986.  Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.[14]  Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[17] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.\\r\\nEvery February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[20] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[21] Janis Joplin (2009),[22] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[23] and Chuck Berry (2012).[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of  \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[25][26] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[27] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", both released in 2006.[28] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660-song list, with eight songs each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. \\r\\nGenerally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters.\\r\\nThe first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[36][37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[39]\\r\\nSister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[40][41] but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[43]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[39] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[44] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[45] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[47] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[47] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[50][51] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[52] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of whom has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\n2016 inductee Steve Miller voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not  enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"When did the rock and roll hall of fame start?"},{"output":"colorless","context":"Phenolphthalein is a chemical compound with the formula C20H14O4 and is often written as \\"HIn\\" or \\"phph\\" in shorthand notation. Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in acidÿbase titrations. For this application, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions. It belongs to class of dyes known as Pthalein dyes.\\r\\nPhenolphthalein is slightly soluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols for use in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H+ ions in solution. The phenolphthalein molecule is colorless, and the phenolphthalein ion is pink.When a base is added to the phenolphthalein, the molecule ? ions equilibrium shifts to the right, leading to more ionization as H+ ions are removed. This is predicted by Le Chatelier's principle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPhenolphthalein's common use is as an indicator in acid-base titrations. It also serves as a component of universal indicator, together with methyl red, bromothymol blue, and thymol blue.[2]\\r\\nPhenolphthalein adopts four different states in aqueous solution: Under very strongly acidic conditions, it exists in protonated form (HIn+), providing an orange coloration. Between strongly acidic and slightly basic conditions, the lactone form (HIn) is colorless. The doubly deprotonated (In2-) phenolate form (the anion form of phenol) gives the familiar pink color. In strongly basic solutions, phenolphthalein's pink color undergoes a rather slow fading reaction and becomes completely colorless above 13.0 pH. The rather slow fading reaction that produces the colorless In(OH)3? ion is sometimes used in classes for the study of reaction kinetics.\\r\\nPhenolphthalein's pH sensitivity is exploited in other applications: Concrete has naturally high pH due to the calcium hydroxide formed when Portland cement reacts with water. As the concrete reacts with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, pH decreases to 8.5-9. When a 1% phenolphthalein solution is applied to normal concrete, it turns bright pink. However, if it remains colorless, it shows that the concrete has undergone carbonation. In a similar application, spackling used to repair holes in drywall contains phenolphthalein. When applied, the basic spackling material retains a pink coloration; when the spackling has cured by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, the pink color fades.[3]\\r\\nPhenolphthalein is used in toys, for example as a component of disappearing inks, or disappearing dye on the Hollywood Hair Barbie hair. In the ink, it is mixed with sodium hydroxide, which reacts with carbon dioxide in the air. This reaction leads to the pH falling below the color change threshold as hydrogen ions are released by the reaction:\\r\\nTo develop the hair and \\"magic\\" graphical patterns, the ink is sprayed with a solution of hydroxide, which leads to the appearance of the hidden graphics by the same mechanism described above for color change in alkaline solution. The pattern will eventually disappear again because of the reaction with carbon dioxide. Thymolphthalein is used for the same purpose and in the same way, when a blue color is desired.[4]\\r\\nPhenolphthalein has been used for over a century as a laxative, but is now being removed from over-the-counter laxatives[5] because of concerns over carcinogenicity.[6][7] Thymolphthalein is a related laxative made from thymol.\\r\\nDespite concerns regarding its carcinogenicity, the use of phenolphthalein as a laxative is unlikely to cause ovarian cancer.[8] Phenolphthalein has been found to inhibit human cellular calcium influx via store-operated calcium entry (SOCE, see Calcium release activated channel ?Structure). This is effected by its inhibiting thrombin and thapsigargin, two activators of SOCE that increase intracellular free calcium.[9]\\r\\nPhenolphthalein has been added to the European Chemicals Agency's candidate list for Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC).[10]\\r\\nA reduced form of phenolphthalein, phenolphthalin, which is colorless, is used in a test to identify substances thought to contain blood, commonly known as the Kastle-Meyer test. A dry sample is collected with a swab or filter paper. A few drops of alcohol, then a few drops of phenolphthalin, and finally a few drops of hydrogen peroxide are dripped onto the sample. If the sample contains hemoglobin, it will turn pink immediately upon addition of the peroxide, because of the generation of phenolphthalein. A positive test indicates the sample contains hemoglobin and, therefore, is likely blood. A false positive can result from the presence of substances with catalytic activity similar to heme. This test is not destructive to the sample; it can be kept and used in further tests. This test has the same reaction with blood from any animal, so further testing would be required to determine whether it originates from a human.\\r\\nPhenolphthalein can be synthesized by condensation of phthalic anhydride with two equivalents of phenol under acidic conditions (hence the name). It was discovered in 1871 by Adolf von Baeyer.[11][12][13]\\r\\nThe reaction can also be catalyzed by a mixture of zinc chloride and thionyl chloride.[15]","input":"What is the colour of phenolphthalein in hcl acid?"},{"output":"The Acela Express","context":"Plans for high-speed rail in the United States date back to the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965. Various state and federal proposals have followed. Despite being one of the world's first countries to get high-speed trains (the Metroliner service in 1969), it failed to spread. Definitions of what constitutes high-speed rail vary, including a range of speeds over 110 miles per hour and dedicated rail lines. Inter-city rail in the United States with top speeds of 90?mph (145?km/h) or more but below 125?mph (201?km/h) is sometimes referred to as higher-speed rail.[1] The Acela Express (reaching 150?mph), the Northeast Regional and MARC Train (both reaching 125?mph, although MARC only qualifies as such by its express trains) are currently the only services in the country (the Metroliner was discontinued in 2006).\\r\\nThere are plans for higher-speed rail and high-speed rail in California, the Midwest, New England, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, the Pacific Northwest, Colorado/ New Mexico, and the Southwestern United States.\\r\\nIn 2016 Amtrak awarded Alstom a contract for 28 Avelia Liberty trainsets to enter service 2021.[2]\\r\\nAs of 2017, the California High-Speed Rail Authority is working on the California High Speed Rail project, which is planned to link Anaheim, Bakersfield, Fresno, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose. Construction is under way on sections traversing the Central Valley. Phase I will be completed in 2029, and Phase II will likely be completed before 2040.[3][4][5]\\r\\nThe Texas Central Railway is a line being built from Houston to Dallas with speeds up to 205?mph (330?km/h). that initially claimed it would transport passengers by 2021, but as of 2017 says it hopes to become fully operational in 2024.[6] There are also higher-speed rail projects in various parts of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthorities in the United States maintain various definitions of high-speed rail. The definitions range from rail services with top speeds of 110 miles per hour (180?km/h) to 150 miles per hour (240?km/h) or higher by the United States Department of Transportation which is an entity in the executive branch,[7] while the United States Code, which is the official codification of Federal statutes, defines them as the rail services with \\"reasonably expected to reach sustained speeds of more than 125 miles per hour\\".[8] A legislative branch agency within the Library of Congress, the Congressional Research Service, used different terms to clarify the confusion by defining the rail services with top speeds less than 150 miles per hour (240?km/h) to be higher-speed rail.[1] There is no current train service in the United States which meets all of the domestic criteria for high-speed rail. Amtrak's Acela Express is classified as \\"higher-speed rail\\" in the Congressional Research Service report by virtue of being on shared tracks, whereas page 5 of that report also requires dedicated tracks to be classified as \\"very high speed rail\\".[1]\\r\\nIn Europe the definition of a minimum speed for newly built high-speed railways is 250?km/h (155?mph); for upgraded high-speed railways it is 200?km/h (124?mph). In places where high-speed rail programs are in earlier developmental stages or where substantial speed increases are achieved by upgrading current infrastructure and/or introducing more advanced trains, lower minimum speed definitions of high-speed rail are used.[9] This is the case in the United States. For transportation planning purposes focussing on the development of high-speed rail, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) distinguishes four types of intercity passenger rail corridors:[10]\\r\\nHowever, state-level departments of transportation and council of governments may also use different definitions for high-speed rail. For examples, the North Central Texas Council of Governments uses the definition of the speeds over 150?mph (241?km/h), and the Texas Department of Transportation and Oklahoma Department of Transportation use the speeds of 165?mph (266?km/h) or more. These agencies have a separate category for higher-speed rail which can be a wide range of speeds between 80?mph (129?km/h) and 150?mph (241?km/h).[11][12]\\r\\nThe development of the American rail network during the 19th century created structural impediments to the adoption of high-speed rail in the later half of the 20th that were not present in Europe and Asia. Freight on American railroads had to travel vastly longer distances, so railroads developed longer cars that could be joined into longer trains. In contrast to Europe, these freights traveled past very few older buildings that were at risk of structural damage from vibrations created by heavy passing trains (even today, American freight cars and their contents may be as heavy as 286,000 pounds (130,000?kg), while their European counterparts are limited to 190,000 pounds (86,000?kg)).[13]\\r\\nWith such long and heavy freights often sharing the same tracks as passenger trains, it was necessary to require that passenger cars be able to withstand the higher impact forces of a potential collision with those freights. Axial strength standards, first required for the mail cars where clerks worked sorting mail en route and later applied to passenger cars, require that an American passenger car be able to withstand 800,000 pounds-force (3,600?kN) applied to either end, as opposed to the 450,000 pounds-force (2,000?kN) European regulations mandate. This necessarily results in American passenger cars being made of heavier materials.[13]\\r\\nDuring the period from 1900 to 1941, most long-distance travel was by rail in the United States. Rail transportation was not high-speed by modern standards but inter-city travel often averaged speeds between 40 and 65 miles per hour (64 and 105?km/h).[14] Most of the major railroads had faster than normal trains called \\"express\\" or \\"limited\\" on their mainline routes (e.g. the Empire State Express and the 20th Century Limited) between major towns and cities.\\r\\nThe development of faster trains, however, faced indirect regulatory hurdles. After a 1921 crash at Porter, Indiana, in which a derail failed to stop one passenger train that had already passed through two red lights from crashing into another at a level junction, killing 37,[15] the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ordered almost a hundred railroads to install automatic train stops by the end of 1925.[16] The railroads opposed the ICC vigorously, noting that stopping longer freights that way might lead to derailments. As a result, the requirement was revised to allow waivers for certain lines, and rarely enforced as the debate continued without any real resolution over the next two decades; in the meantime passenger fatalities began declining as the automobile emerged as a transportation option.[17]\\r\\nDuring the 1930s railroads began to develop lightweight, diesel-powered streamlined trains which provided even faster running times than the previous express trains.[18] Two early streamliners were the Union Pacific M-10000 (nicknamed Little Zip and The City of Salina) in revenue service between 1934 and 1941/42 and the Burlington Railroad's Zephyr. The design of the Zephyr incorporated a diesel-electric power system; the M-10000 used a spark-ignition engine running on \\"petroleum distillate\\", a fuel similar to kerosene. These trains were much lighter than the common engines and passenger cars of the day, as the \\"Zephyr\\" was constructed using stainless steel and the M-10000 chiefly of the aircraft alloy Duralumin.\\r\\nOn May 26, 1934, the Zephyr made a record-breaking \\"Dawn to Dusk\\" run from Denver to Chicago. The train covered the distance in 13 hours, reaching a top speed of 112.5?mph (181.1?km/h) and running at an average speed of 77.6?mph (124.9?km/h). However the railroad was unable to capitalize on this since the Depression had cut into the demand for intercity rail travel.\\r\\nMany steam locomotives were streamlined during this time to attract passengers, and the first steam streamlined locomotive was the New York Central's Commodore Vanderbilt.[19] Nonetheless, some of these steam locomotives became very fastsome were said to exceed 120?mph (193?km/h) on a regular basis. Examples include the New York Central's \\"Super Hudsons\\" as used on the Twentieth Century Limited; the Milwaukee Road's purpose-built Atlantics and Hudsons used in Hiawatha service; the Pennsylvania Railroad's duplex-drive 4-4-4-4 type T1 locomotives, and two Union Pacific engines, a 4-6-2 and a 4-8-2, used on the \\"Forty Niner\\" and other trains.\\r\\nThe debate over signaling and train control between the railroads and the ICC had never really been settled, just deferred as passenger deaths declined, in part due to more travelers using their automobiles for shorter commutes and an expanding and improving highway network. It ended in 1946, when one express passenger train crashed into another one that had stopped, both operated by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, in Naperville, Illinois. The conductor of the first train had had it stopped in the town outside Chicago because he thought something was dragging; within two minutes it was struck from behind by another traveling at 86 miles per hour (138?km/h), killing 45.[20]\\r\\nThe engineer of the second train survived the crash, and claimed he had not seen the signal in sufficient time to stop his train. Investigation showed that even if he had missed the yellow light going on, warning him to slow down in anticipation of a red, he still had space to stop the train had he applied his full brakes at the red. As a result, the ICC decided the time had come to force the issue of train control.[20]\\r\\nFor the first time it set national rail speed limits. In 1947 it ordered that automatic block signaling be used where freight traveled at more than 49 miles per hour (79?km/h) and on passenger lines where trains went faster than 59 miles per hour (95?km/h). This rule remains in force today.[20]\\r\\nWhile the railroads generally complied with this rule, affecting 18,000 miles (29,000?km) of track, they were not as tolerant of the ICC\\"s additional requirement for ATS or cab signalling on passenger trains that exceeded 79 miles per hour (127?km/h). Some railroads complied with the equipment requirement in part, and installed it on about 5,000 miles (8,000?km) of track. This was what the ICC had hoped for. But on the other 22,000 miles (35,000?km) where the rule applied, railroads simply ran their trains under the limit. This made intercity passenger rail an even less competitive option, accelerating its decline as not only automobile use was increasing but airlines were beginning to compete on longer routes. By the late 1950s many passenger routes that had existed at the time of the Naperville crash had been discontinued.[20]\\r\\nThe results of World War II shifted further high-speed rail technological development overseas. While the U.S. had not suffered the infrastructure damage it had inflicted on Europe and Japan, it had also developed its road network, leading to the creation of the Interstate Highway System after the war, giving prosperous citizens an efficient way to use the cars they were buying. Europe and Japan, by contrast, had largely not begun to build highway networks and had seen heavy damage to their rail systems. With their citizens impoverished as they rebuilt their economies, and unable to afford automobiles to the extent Americans could, those countries invested in rail as the primary means of intercity travel.[13]\\r\\nFollowing the creation of Japan's first high-speed Shinkansen, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson asked the U.S. Congress to devise a way to increase speeds on American railroads. The request was part of his Great Society infrastructure building initiatives.[21] Congress delivered the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 which passed with overwhelming bi-partisan support. It helped to create regular Metroliner service between New York City and Washington, D.C. inaugurated in 1969. Trains on the line reached speeds of 125 miles per hour (201?km/h) and averaged 90 miles per hour (140?km/h) along the route, faster than even Acela Express trains operated between the cities of New York and Washington in 2012. The Metroliner was able to travel from New York to Washington in just 2.5 hours because it did not make any intermediate stops.[22]\\r\\nU.S. federal and state governments continued to revisit the idea of fast trains. The Passenger Railroad Rebuilding Act of 1980 led to funding of high-speed corridor studies in 1984. Private-sector consortia intending to build high-speed lines were created in Florida, Ohio, Texas, California, and Nevada. Maglev trains became a new field of interest. They were officially added to the definition of \\"railroad\\" in 1988, and were studied repeatedly. Five high-speed corridors were officially endorsed in October 1992 following passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.[23] TEA-21 and other legislation continued to be passed with mentions of high-speed rail, but lacking funding or real direction.[24] Nevertheless, no new high-speed service was added to the U.S. passenger rail system following the Metroliners.\\r\\nIn 1993, the U.S. attempted to improve service between Boston and New York by electrifying the Northeast Corridor north of New Haven, Connecticut and purchasing new train sets to replace the by then 30-year-old Metroliners and run on the newly electrified route. Some existing trains (Swedish X 2000 and German ICE 1) were tested, but finally, the Acela, a new tilting train manufactured by Alstom and Bombardier, was ordered.\\r\\nThe new service was named \\"Acela Express\\" and ran on the Northeast Corridor, linking Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. The service was inaugurated in December 2000, and was an immediate success, operated at a profit and as of 2012[update], it produced about 25% of Amtrak's total service revenue.[25] The Acela lacks a dedicated high-speed rail line which limits its average speed, although it reaches a maximum speed of 150?mph (240?km/h) on small sections of its route through Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\\r\\nThe travel time between Washington and New York is 2 hours and 53 minutes (compared to 2 hours and 30 minutes for PRR's nonstop Metroliner in 1969), or an average speed of 79?mph (127?km/h). Schedule between New York and Boston is 3 hours 34 minutes, an average speed of only 63?mph (101?km/h). With a 15-minute layover in New York, the entire end-to-end trip averages 68?mph (110?km/h).[26]\\r\\nThe largest project for American high-speed rail is the California High-Speed Rail network, which was authorized by voters with Proposition 1A in 2008. In August 2013, Tutor Perini signed a $1-billion contract to begin construction of the first phase in 2014.[27] Construction began in early 2015.\\r\\nHigh-speed rail development was a goal of the Obama administration which came into office in January 2009. Higher jet fuel prices, congested airports and highways, and increasing airport security rules have combined to make high-speed rail a more attractive option for passengers. A study conducted by the International Union of Railways indicated that high-speed trains produced five times less CO2 than automobiles and jet aircraft.[28] Most high-speed rail systems use electricity for power, so they lessen dependence on petroleum and can be powered by renewable energy sources, or by nuclear power such as in Japan and France. There has been a resurgence of interest in recent decades, with many plans being examined for high-speed rail across the country, but current service remains relatively limited. The activities of the succeeding president, Donald Trump, have not been for a future uptick in High Speed Rail proposals.\\r\\nIn 2012, then-Amtrak president Joseph Boardman proposed a plan to build a dedicated high-speed rail line between Washington, D.C. and Boston. He estimated it would cost $151 billion and take more than 25 years to design and build the line.[29] The proposed rail line would allow for top speeds of 220?mph (354?km/h).[30][31]\\r\\nAmtrak officials released a concept report for next-generation high-speed rail within the Northeast Corridor (NEC) on October 1, 2010.[32] Amtrak projected planning and construction of the next-generation high-speed Northeast Corridor line will cost approximately $117 billion (2010 dollars) and reduce the travel time from New York to Washington, including a stop in Philadelphia, to 96 minutes, and the travel time from Boston to New York to 84 minutes by 2040.[33][34] In 2012, Amtrak released the details of the proposal.\\r\\nThe first of two phases envisions the NEC's to be upgraded allowing Acela speed improvements. By 2025 Acela trainsets will be replaced with new trainsets. The new trainsets will be limited to the maximum speed supported by the NEC. The second phase will begin and new track, stations and systems will be constructed separately from the NEC network. The construction will start on the New York to Washington, DC segment first which will be completed in 2030. By 2040, the construction of the dedicated network for the New York to Boston segment will be completed. At that time, the oldest 12 trains will be retired and 14 new ones will be deployed increasing the total capacity to 46. This is projected to cut the travel time from Boston to Washington, DC to 3 hours and 8 minutes. The entire initiative is expected to cost $151 billion (2012 dollars).[35][36]\\r\\nThe concept proposes 220?mph trains running on dedicated tracks between Washington, D.C. and Boston, Massachusetts which will closely follow the existing Northeast Corridor south of New York City.\\r\\nA number of different routes will be studied north of New York City, including one through interior Connecticut paralleling Interstates 684, 84, and 90, one following the existing shoreline route paralleling Interstate 95 and one via Long Island (requiring a bridge or tunnel across Long Island Sound to Connecticut). Another possible route could follow the existing NEC and I-95 from New York to New Haven, Connecticut, then turn north and follow I-91 to either Hartford or Springfield, Massachusetts before turning east or northeast toward Boston. [37]\\r\\nThe current NEC network would be used for non-high-speed passenger rail and freight services.\\r\\nIn 2012, the Northeast Maglev, a small firm in Washington, D.C. with backing from the Central Japan Railway Company, proposed a new high-speed rail service along the Northeast Corridor with initial service between Washington, DC and New York City and they have spent $1.4 million lobbying Congress.[38] The proposal calls for the use of maglev technology which will require infrastructure separate from the Amtrak's NEC networks. The company proposes to deploy the JR-Maglev trains on a service from Washington, D.C. to New York City with a travel time of 60 minutes.[39] Previous proposals of deploying maglev in the area have stalled due to lack of funding and legislative support.[39] In November 2015, the Federal Railroad Administration approved a grant of $27.8 million to Maryland Department of Transportation and Maryland Economic Development Corporation[40] to conduct studies on building a high-speed Maglev line that would carry passengers between Washington and Baltimore.[41]\\r\\nIn February 2011 Amtrak announced plans for the Gateway Project, an 11-mile high-speed right of way across the Meadowlands, the Hudson Palisades, and the Hudson River, between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station.[42] In November 2011, US Congress allocated $15 million for engineering work on the project.[43][44][45] It remains unclear how much preliminary work done for the somewhat similar cancelled ARC project will be utilized. In August 2011, the United States Department of Transportation obligated $450 million to a six-year project to support capacity increases on one of the busiest segments on the NEC, a 24 miles (39?km) section in New Jersey between New Brunswick and Trenton. The project is designed to upgrade electrical power, signal systems, and overhead catenary wires to improve reliability and increase speeds up to 160?mph (260?km/h), and after the purchase of new equipment, up to 186?mph (299?km/h). Testing in September 2012 achieved record-breaking speeds for existing rail in the USA.[46] However, the TurboTrain already set the record of 170.8?mph (274.9?km/h) at the same location in 1967.[47] Work is being done in coordination with New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, which is redeveloping Amtrak's County Yard and building the Mid Line Loop.[48]\\r\\nIn 2011 Congress obligated $295 million to improvements at Harold Interlocking, the nation's busiest rail junction nearby Sunnyside Yards in Queens, New York so that Amtrak's New England service can avoid congestion and bypass New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road trains.[49]\\r\\nNew York State has been actively discussing high-speed rail service since the 1990s, but thus far little progress has been made. Amtrak Acela service between Washington, D.C. and Boston is available to New York City, but cities in Upstate New York and Western New York remain isolated from high-speed rail service. Further, destinations outside the New York metropolitan area have been plagued by delayed service for decades. Nonetheless, New York has been quietly endorsing and even implementing rail improvements for years.\\r\\nCloser and faster railroad transportation links between New York City and the rest of the state are frequently cited as a partial solution to Upstate's stagnant economic growth.\\r\\nBeginning in 2010, a study conducted by the New York State Department of Transportation identified 10 alternatives for improving the Empire Corridor. In early 2014, a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement was released for public review and comments. The draft eliminated 5 of the alternatives, including those with top speeds of 160?mph (257?km/h) and 220?mph (354?km/h). The remaining 5 build alternatives under consideration have top speeds of 79?mph (127?km/h) (the base alternative), 90?mph (145?km/h) (options A and B), 110?mph (177?km/h), and 125?mph (201?km/h).[50]\\r\\nThe Keystone Corridor is a 349-mile (562?km) rail line between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, composed of two different segments. Between Philadelphia and Harrisburg the Amtrak line is electrified and grade separation was completed in 2014. Between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh the Norfolk Southern-owned line is used for freight transportation. In 1999, the Keystone Corridor was formally recognized as a \\"designated high-speed corridor\\" by the Federal Railroad Administration. The Keystone Corridor was upgraded in 2006 with two segments of 110?mph (176?km/h) which is a higher-speed rail service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, with express service taking 95-100?minutes over 103.6?miles (165.8 kilometres).[51]\\r\\nCalifornia Proposition 1A, passed in November 2008, authorized the state to issue $9.95 billion in bonds to fund the first phase of a planned multi-phase high-speed rail network. Steel-wheel on rail technology is the adopted mode. Los Angeles to San Francisco, via California's Central Valley, will be the first phase of the network. The California High-Speed Rail Authority is the lead agency charged with planning and implementing the system. The network is planned to allow trains at speeds of up to 220?mph (350?km/h) to potentially link San Francisco and Los Angeles in as little as two hours and thirty-eight minutes. The state has been awarded $2.35 billion in funding from the federal government.\\r\\nSince the passage of Proposition 1A, cost estimates for the project have risen due to increased planning and disputes over routes. Ridership projections have faced scrutiny by a number of groups including UC Berkeleys Institute of Transportation Studies.[52] In May 2013, with costs estimates double the original figures approved by the voters in 2008, opponents[which?] filed lawsuits intended to invalidate the $10 billion bond measures which were part of the financing of the rail line.[53]\\r\\nAs of March 2016, the Authority has 110 miles of railbed from Madera to near Bakersfield under contract for design and construction. Major construction on the northernmost 29 miles of this segment, between Madera and Fresno, commenced in June 2015. These contracts do not include track, stations, or electrical infrastructure such as traction power, control systems and catenary.\\r\\nA private consortium has proposed building a new high-speed line between Las Vegas, Nevada and Victorville, California. This proposal, named XpressWest (formerly known as DesertXpress) concerns improved transit between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which has no passenger rail connection. The cost of the initial segment is estimated at between $4bn and $5bn,[54] with trains travelling up to 150?mph (240?km/h) making the 186?mi (299?km) journey in around 84 minutes.[54] The route is not planned to be extended directly to Los Angeles, although another proposal extends it to Palmdale to interchange with the CHSR network.[55]\\r\\nIn June 2016, XpressWest announced that the joint venture had been called off. The decision was based \\"primarily upon difficulties associated with timely performance and CRIs challenges in obtaining required authority to proceed with required development activities.\\" The biggest challenge cited for the termination of the joint venture was a federal regulation requiring the manufacture of the high speed trains inside the United States.[56]\\r\\nThe Pacific Northwest Corridor or the Pacific Northwest Rail Corridor is one of eleven federally designated high-speed rail corridors in the United States.[57] It was designated a high-speed rail by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA).[58] Improvements proposed in Washington State's long range plan would have had passenger trains operating at a maximum speed of 110 miles per hour (180?km/h) on line.[59]\\r\\nThe Cascadia high-speed rail was a proposed dedicated high-speed rail line that would have connected Salem/Portland, Vancouver WA/Olympia/Tacoma/Seattle/Everett, and Bellingham, Washington.[60][61]\\r\\nAs of 2012, neither the Washington State Department of Transportation [62] nor Oregon plan to implement speeds higher than 79?mph (127?km/h) due to safety and other freight service concerns voiced by the track owner, Union Pacific Railroad.[63] The plan to provide high-speed and higher-speed rail services on this corridor was thus halted.\\r\\nOn July 9, 2009 the governors of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas announced plans to jointly seek federal designation of a high-speed rail corridor linking Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso and request up to $5 million in federal funding for a feasibility study.[64]\\r\\nIn 2010 the Rocky Mountain Rail Authority did a high-speed rail feasibility study.[65] Primary corridors being studied are the Interstate 70 corridor from Denver International Airport (DEN) to Eagle Airport (EGE) in Eagle County near Vail, and the Interstate 25 corridor from the Wyoming border to the New Mexico border.[66] These corridors however, are not defined as high-speed rail corridors by the FRA.\\r\\nDevelopment of a high-speed rail system in Florida was mandated by a constitutional referendum in 2000, but taken off the books by another referendum in 2004.[67] Florida resurrected its high-speed rail authority to capitalize on the nationwide effort to build a high-speed rail network. Florida legislature approved SunRail in a special session in late 2009, which along with work already completed on the originally proposed line between Tampa and Orlando, was instrumental in the state winning a significant amount of the total amount allotted to high-speed rail. Only California received more high-speed rail funding than Florida. In February 2011, Florida's newly elected governor Rick Scott cancelled the project.[68] Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood then announced he would be redirecting the funds intended for Florida to other states.\\r\\nIn 2012, a plan for a 240-mile (390?km) higher-speed rail from Miami to Orlando to be operated by a privately owned developer was announced. The plan called \\"All Aboard Florida\\" included a 40-mile (64?km) segment between Cocoa and Orlando with a top speed of 125?mph (201?km/h).[69] The plan was later renamed to Brightline, and began service between Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach on January 13, 2018.\\r\\nThe Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor is a passenger rail transportation project to extend high-speed passenger rail services from Washington, D.C. south through Richmond and Petersburg in Virginia through Raleigh and Charlotte in North Carolina and connect with the existing high-speed rail corridor from DC to Boston, Massachusetts known as the Northeast Corridor. Since first established in 1992, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has since extended the corridor to Atlanta and Macon, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; and Birmingham, Alabama.\\r\\nIncremental rail improvements to existing rail lines have been taking place while the environmental impact study required under the National Environmental Policy Act is being completed. The two-tiered EIS began in 1999, and completion is expected in 2011, with passenger service expected by 2015 to 2020, depending upon funding availability.\\r\\nIn 1991 the Texas High Speed Rail Authority awarded a 50-year high-speed rail franchise to the Texas TGV Corporation? a consortium of Morrison Knudsen (USA), Bombardier (Canada), Alstom (France/UK), Crdit Lyonnais (France), Banque IndoSuez (France), Merrill Lynch (USA), and others. Texas TGV won the franchise after more than two years of litigation instigated by a rival consortium backing German ICE technology.\\r\\nThe plan was to connect the \\"Texas Triangle\\" (Houston ? Dallas/Fort Worth ? San Antonio) with a privately financed high-speed train system which would quickly take passengers from one city to the next at prices designed to compete with or beat other transport options. This was the same model Southwest Airlines used 20?years earlier to break into the Texas market where it served the same three cities.\\r\\nFunding for the project was to come entirely from private sources, since Texas did not allow the use of public money. The original estimated cost was $5.6?billion, but the task of securing the necessary private funds proved extremely difficult.\\r\\nSouthwest Airlines, with the help of lobbyists, created legal barriers to prohibit the consortium from moving forward and the entire project was eventually scuttled in 1994, when the State of Texas withdrew the franchise.[70] Several hotel chains like Days Inn, Best Western, and La Quinta Inn, as well as fast food establishments like McDonald's and Burger King lobbied against the plan,[70] primarily because many of their locations were located along Interstates and in several highway-dependent rural towns.\\r\\nAnother proposal for high-speed rail in Texas was part of a larger proposed, statewide super-infrastructure, the Trans-Texas Corridor. In 2002, Governor Rick Perry proposed the project, but it was eventually canceled by the legislature in 2009.[71]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Texas High Speed Rail and Transportation Corporation (THSRTC), a grass roots organization dedicated to bringing high-speed rail to Texas was established. In 2006, American Airlines and Continental Airlines formally joined THSRTC, in an effort to bring high-speed rail to Texas as a passenger collector system for the airlines. The Texas High Speed Rail and Transportation Corporation developed the Texas T-Bone and Brazos Express corridors to link Central Texas.[70]\\r\\nIn 2010, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) received a federal grant to study a high-speed rail corridor linking Oklahoma City with DallasÿFort Worth.[72] The state also received another grant in 2011 to start engineering and environmental work on a high-speed link between Houston and Dallas.[73] Another study was being conducted in 2012 by TxDOT on a possible link between Houston and Austin.[74]\\r\\nWhile the preliminary work was in progress by TxDOT for the Houston to Dallas line, an unrelated project to build a high-speed railway between the two cities was announced in 2011 by a private company, Lone Star High Speed Rail. The company was founded in 2009 by U.S. Japan High Speed Rail to market the use of N700-I bullet train in Texas.[75] In 2012, the company with a new name, Texas Central Railway Company, announced that Central Japan Railway Company signed up to be the primary investor in the project with the total estimated cost of $10 billion to be privately funded. The preliminary engineering, market and financing studies have been started for the service with maximum speed of 205 miles per hour and travel time of 90 minutes. The plan was to seek additional investors in late 2012, start the construction in 2014, and begin the service in 2024.[76]\\r\\nThe Midwest Regional Rail Initiative or Midwest Regional Rail System (MRRI, MWRRI, or MWRRS) is a plan to implement a 220?mph (354?km/h) to 110?mph (177?km/h) passenger rail network in the Midwestern United States, using Chicago, Illinois as a hub. Primary routes would stretch across Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, possibly reaching Kentucky. Secondary routes would operate at a slower speed across Missouri and Iowa, just touching Nebraska and nearly reaching Kansas. With some upgrades already completed, trains regularly travel at 110?mph (177?km/h) for a significant distance in Michigan and for a short distance in Illinois.\\r\\nConstruction to provide higher-speed rail services between Chicago and St. Louis is taking place.[77] Illinois has been one of the most aggressive at pursuing highspeed rail, getting $1.1?billion in 2010.[78] Governor Quinn said that \\"we want to make this corridor the pre-eminent one in America\\". The ChicagoÿSt. Louis rail line is being upgraded so passenger trains will be able to reach top speeds of 110 miles per hour (180?km/h) between Carlinville, Illinois and Joliet, Illinois, with work scheduled to be completed in 2017.[79][80][81] Plans have been such that they originated from the southern part of the state going up north. The first installment of funds provided for construction between Alton and Lincoln. In March 2011, the next installment of funds ($685?million) provided for another section to go from Lincoln to Dwight.[82] In May 2011, additional funds got allocated for further construction between Dwight and Joliet.[83]\\r\\nIn June 2011, Illinois commenced a study on implementing a 220?mph service between Chicago and Champaign-Urbana.[84] Legislation passed in 2013 gives the Illinois Tollway the power to build high-speed rail lines.[85] Plans called for eventually investing in true high-speed travel that would boost train speeds to 220?mph (354?km/h).[86] Once the United States' entire high-speed rail projects are built and thus connected to one another, Chicago will be the hub of the country's high-speed rail network.\\r\\nAs a result of upgrades that begin in 2001, trains in Michigan now travel at 110?mph (177?km/h) for 98 miles (158?km) between Porter, Indiana and Kalamazoo, Michigan.[87] On May 9, 2011, the state received $196.5?million to extend the higher speed rail upgrades from Kalamazoo an additional 135 miles (217?km) to Dearborn, Michigan. The improvements would reduce the travel time from Chicago to Detroit to roughly 5 hours.[88] Michigan had received more than $161?million for high-speed rail and $40?million for Amtrak stations in Troy, Battle Creek and Dearborn.[89]\\r\\nAbout 30 miles (50?km) of the Michigan trains' route passes through a congested area of northwestern Indiana along Lake Michigan's south shore, where trains are regularly delayed by freight traffic.[90] In early 2010 the federal government authorized some $71.4?million for this project.[91]\\r\\nIn Minnesota, there is a proposed high-speed rail service from Rochester to the Twin Cities called Zip Rail. The trains would run on a dedicated track at speeds between 150?mph (240?km/h) and 220?mph (350?km/h).[92] This is proposed to be a publicÿprivate partnership with public funding for capital costs and private investment for operations, maintenance and growing ridership.[93]\\r\\nThe Ohio Hub is a project created by the Ohio Department of Transportation that is intended to connect Ohio with four other states, as well as Canada, by a passenger rail network. The main proposal is a four-corridor system based in Cleveland with branches terminating in Detroit, Toronto, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh. Both a 79?mph (126?km/h) and 110?mph (176?km/h) high-speed rail network have been proposed, costing a total $2.7?billion and $3.32?billion, respectively.\\r\\nThe project is currently in an unknown state after Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced after being elected in 2010 that he would scrap the plan. In response, federal transportation funds intended for the project were rescinded and redirected to other states.[94]\\r\\nThe cities of Denver, Las Vegas, Reno, Phoenix and Salt Lake City have recently formed the Western High Speed Rail Alliance, which is slated to spend $11 million over three years to study the feasibility of building railway links between the major cities of the southwestern United States, as well as linking to the California high-speed corridor via Las Vegas.[95][96] All four states represented are in the top ten fastest growing states, with Utah and Colorado topping the list. New Mexico is considering joining in order to include Albuquerque and Santa Fe in the network by upgrading and extending its recently completed Rail Runner Express. Major obstacles to high-speed rail in the region include highly competitive airline fares, rugged geography, and funding. Critics argue that high-speed rail works best in densely populated regions (such as the various large cities of the East Coast and the eastern half of the Midwest), and will not be feasible in the sparsely populated West.[97]\\r\\nIn June 2012, the developer of XpressWest, formerly known as DesertXpress, announced that they expanded the planned high-speed rail network to include links to Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Denver. The XpressWest plan was supported by the Western High Speed Rail Alliance.[98]\\r\\nIn February 2009, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), Congress allocated $8 billion to be granted to states for intercity rail projects, with \\"priority to projects that support the development of intercity high speed rail service.\\"[99]\\r\\nIn April 2009, as required by ARRA, the FRA released its strategic plan describing the agency's vision for developing high-speed rail in the United States.[10] As potential funding targets, the plan formally identified ten corridors[100] (all previously designated as high-speed rail corridors by several successive Secretaries of Transportation) as well as the Northeast Corridor. The ten designated high-speed corridors, together with the major cities served by each, are:\\r\\nIn addition to the $8?billion provided by ARRA, the plan predicted an additional $5?billion over 5 years would be made annually available for projects to \\"jump-start a potential world-class passenger rail system.\\"[7] On June 17, 2009, the FRA advised grant applicants that evaluation for funding would be based on a proposal's potential to make trips quicker and more convenient, reduce congestion on highways and at airports, and meet other environmental, energy, and safety goals.[102]\\r\\nThe FRA received grant applications from states for stimulus funds and FY 2009 intercity capital funds in August and October 2009[103] Over $57 Billion in requests were filed from 34 states and on January 28, 2010 31 states and 13 rail corridors received funding.[104][105] The five areas receiving the most funding had originally been designated as high-speed rail corridors in October 1992 following passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.[23]\\r\\nCongress allocated $2.5 billion in the FY 2010 budget[106] and these funds were allocated on October 28, 2010.[107] Major allocations are listed below.\\r\\nOn December 10, 2010, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced $1.2 billion in grants for Wisconsin and Ohio would be removed, and redirected to other states. This was due to opposition from governors-elect in both states, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and John Kasich of Ohio. From the redirected funds, California received $624 million, Florida $342 million, Washington $161 million, and Illinois $42 million. [108]\\r\\nOn February 16, 2011, Florida Governor Rick Scott formally announced that he would be rejecting all federal funds to construct a high-speed railway project in the state, thereby killing the Florida High Speed Rail project. Governor Scott's reasoning behind cancelling the project was that it would be \\"too costly to taxpayers\\" and that \\"the risk far outweigh[ed] the benefits\\".[109] Those funds were once again redistributed to other states.\\r\\nIn February 2011, Vice President Biden proposed spending $53 billion on improved passenger rail service over six years.[110] The plan drew fire from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives, who preferred private investment rather than government investment.[111] No money was appropriated for passenger rail in either the FY 2011[112] or FY 2012[113] budgets.\\r\\nIn an Angus Reid poll released on April 6, 2010, 59% of Americans were in favor of the proposed plan laid out in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Grants, while 26% were opposed and the remaining 15% were unsure. When shown a map of the proposed high-speed lines, 32% of the participants said they would rather take a high-speed train than fly, drive, or take the bus (which would put high-speed rail a few percentage points behind driving but well ahead of flying and taking the bus). Republicans and Independents who took part in the poll were more likely to state that they would rather drive (40% of Republicans and 38% of Independents), while 44% of Democrats stated they would use the proposed high-speed rail system (making it the most popular choice among Democrats).[114] Among Republicans, high-speed rail was competitive with air travel (24% to 24%), while high-speed rail was preferred to air travel among both Independents and Democrats.","input":"What is the fastest train in the us?"},{"output":"designed to release (liberate) a drug at a predetermined rate in order to maintain a constant drug concentration for a specific period of time with minimum side effects","context":"Modified-release dosage is a mechanism that (in contrast to immediate-release dosage) delivers a drug with a delay after its administration (delayed-release dosage) or for a prolonged period of time (extended-release [ER, XR, XL] dosage) or to a specific target in the body (targeted-release dosage).[1]\\r\\nSustained-release dosage forms are dosage forms designed to release (liberate) a drug at a predetermined rate in order to maintain a constant drug concentration for a specific period of time with minimum side effects. This can be achieved through a variety of formulations, including liposomes and drug-polymer conjugates (an example being hydrogels). Sustained release's definition is more akin to a \\"controlled release\\" rather than \\"sustained\\".\\r\\nExtended-release dosage consists of sustained-release (SR) and controlled-release (CR) dosage. SR maintains drug release over a sustained period but not at a constant rate. CR maintains drug release over a sustained period at a nearly constant rate.[1]\\r\\nSometimes these and other terms are treated as synonyms, but the United States Food and Drug Administration has in fact defined most of these as different concepts.[1] Sometimes the term \\"depot tablet\\" is used by non-native speakers, but this is not found in any English dictionaries and is a literal translation of the term used in Swedish and some other languages.\\r\\nModified-release dosage and its variants are mechanisms used in tablets (pills) and capsules to dissolve a drug over time in order to be released slower and steadier into the bloodstream while having the advantage of being taken at less frequent intervals than immediate-release (IR) formulations of the same drug. For example, extended-release morphine enables people with chronic pain to only take one or two tablets per day.\\r\\nMost commonly it refers to time dependent release in oral dose formulations. Timed release has several distinct variants such as sustained release where prolonged release is intended, pulse release, delayed release (e.g. to target different regions of the GI tract) etc. A distinction of controlled release is that not only it prolongs action but it attempts to maintain drug levels within the therapeutic window to avoid potentially hazardous peaks in drug concentration following ingestion or injection and to maximize therapeutic efficiency.\\r\\nIn addition to pills, capsules and injectable drug carriers (that often have an additional release function), forms of controlled release medicines include gels, implants and devices (e.g. the vaginal ring and contraceptive implant) and transdermal patches.\\r\\nExamples of cosmetics, personal care and food science applications often centre on odour or flavour release.\\r\\nThe release technology scientific and industrial community is represented by the Controlled Release Society (CRS). The CRS is the worldwide society for delivery science and technologies. CRS serves more than 1,600 members from more than 50 countries. Two-thirds of CRS membership is represented by industry and one-third represents academia and government. CRS is affiliated with the Journal of Controlled Release and Drug Delivery and Translational Research scientific journals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest SR drugs is associated with a patent in 1938 by Israel Lipowski, who coated pellets which led to coating particles.[2] The science of controlled release developed further with more oral sustained-release products in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the development of controlled release of marine anti-foulants in the 1950s and controlled release fertilizer in the 1970s where sustained and controlled delivery of nutrients following a single application to the soil. Delivery is usually effected by dissolution, degradation or disintegration of an excipient in which the active compound is formulated. Enteric coating and other encapsulation technologies can further modify release profiles.\\r\\nThere is no industry standard for these abbreviations, and confusion and misreading have sometimes caused prescribing errors.[3] Clear handwriting is necessary. For some drugs with multiple formulations, putting the meaning in parentheses is advisable.\\r\\nA few other abbreviations are similar to these (in that they may serve as suffixes) but refer to dose rather than release rate. They include ES and XS (extra strength).\\r\\nToday, most time-release drugs are formulated so that the active ingredient is embedded in a matrix of insoluble substance(s) (various: some acrylics, even chitin; these substances are often patented) such that the dissolving drug must find its way out through the holes.\\r\\nIn some SR formulations, the drug dissolves into the matrix, and the matrix physically swells to form a gel, allowing the drug to exit through the gel's outer surface.\\r\\nMicro-encapsulation is also regarded as a more complete technology to produce complex dissolution profiles. Through coating an active pharmaceutical ingredient around an inert core, and layering it with insoluble substances to form a microsphere one can obtain more consistent and replicable dissolution rates in a convenient format that can be mixed and matched with other instant release pharmaceutical ingredients in to any two piece gelatin capsule.\\r\\nThere are certain considerations for the formation of sustained-release formulation:\\r\\nThe half-life of the drug refers to the drug's elimination from the bloodstream which can be caused by metabolism, urine, and other forms of excretion. If the active compound has a long half-life (over 6 hours), it is sustained on its own. If the active compound has a short half-life, it would require a large amount to maintain a prolonged effective dose. In this case, a broad therapeutic window is necessary to avoid toxicity; otherwise, the risk is unwarranted and another mode of administration would be recommended.[4] Appropriate half-lifes used to apply sustained methods are typically 3ÿ4 hours and a drug greater than 0.5 grams is too big.[5][6]\\r\\nThe therapeutic index also factors whether a drug can be used as a time release drug. A drug with a thin therapeutic range, or small therapeutic index, will be determined unfit for a sustained release mechanism in partial fear of dose dumping which can prove fatal at the conditions mentioned.[7] For a drug that is made to be released over time, the general goals is to stay within the therapeutic range as long as needed.[4]\\r\\nThere are many different methods used to obtain a sustained release.\\r\\nDiffusion systems rate release is dependent on the rate at which the drug dissolves through a barrier which is usually a type of polymer. Diffusion systems can be broken into two subcategories, reservoir devices and matrix devices.[4]\\r\\nDissolution systems must have the system dissolved slowly in order for the drug to have sustained release properties which can be achieved by using appropriate salts and/or derivatives as well as coating the drug with a dissolving material.[4] It is used for drug compounds with high solubility in water.[7] When the drug is covered with some slow dissolving coat, it will eventually release the drug. Instead of diffusion, the drug release depends on the solubility and thickness of the coating. Because of this mechanism, the dissolution will be the rate limiting factor here for drug release.[4] Dissolution systems can be broken down to subcategories called reservoir devices and matrix devices.[7]\\r\\nOsmotic controlled-release oral delivery systems (OROS) have the form of a rigid tablet with a semi-permeable outer membrane and one or more small laser drilled holes in it. As the tablet passes through the body, water is absorbed through the semipermeable membrane via osmosis, and the resulting osmotic pressure is used to push the active drug through the opening(s) in the tablet. OROS is a trademarked name owned by ALZA Corporation, which pioneered the use of osmotic pumps for oral drug delivery.[10][11][12]\\r\\nOsmotic release systems have a number of major advantages over other controlled-release mechanisms. They are significantly less affected by factors such as pH, food intake, GI motility, and differing intestinal environments. Using an osmotic pump to deliver drugs has additional inherent advantages regarding control over drug delivery rates. This allows for much more precise drug delivery over an extended period of time, which results in much more predictable pharmacokinetics. However, osmotic release systems are relatively complicated, somewhat difficult to manufacture, and may cause irritation or even blockage of the GI tract due to prolonged release of irritating drugs from the non-deformable tablet.[10][13][14][15][16][17][18]\\r\\nIn the ion-exchange method, the resins are cross-linked water-insoluble polymers that contain ionisable functional groups that form a repeating pattern of polymers, creating a polymer chain.[4][7] The drug is attached to the resin and is released when an appropriate interaction of ions and ion exchange groups occur. The area and length of the drug release and number of cross-link polymers dictate the rate at which the drug is released, determining the SR effect.[7]\\r\\nA floating system is a system where it floats on gastric fluids due to low-density. The density of the gastric fluids is about 1 g/mL; thus, the drug/tablet administered must have a smaller density. The buoyancy will allow the system to float to the top of the stomach and release at a slower rate without worry of excreting it. This system requires there are enough gastric fluids present as well as food.[4] Many types of forms of drugs use this method such as powders, capsules, and tablets.[19]\\r\\nBio-adhesive systems generally are meant to stick to mucus and can be favorable for mouth based interactions due to high mucus levels in the general area but not as simple for other areas.

The film stars Dylan O'Brien, Michael Keaton, Sanaa Lathan, Shiva Negar and Taylor Kitsch, and follows young CIA black ops recruit Mitch Rapp, who helps a Cold War veteran try to stop the detonation of a rogue nuclear weapon.\\r\\nThe film was released in the United States on September 15, 2017, and has grossed over $52 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, who described the plot as mundane, clichd, and without thrills, but praised the cast's performances.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMitch Rapp and his girlfriend are on vacation in Ibiza, Spain, when a radical Islamist jihadist cell lands on the beach and begins to attack the civilians with assault rifles. Amid the carnage, Rapp frantically attempts to find his girlfriend, but is unable to prevent her death at the hands of the terrorists.\\r\\nEighteen months later, Rapp, now consumed by his desire for vengeance, frequents an internet message board where the terrorist responsible for his girlfriend's murder quizzes Rapp on aspects of Islam and jihad. Having secured an invitation to meet him face to face, Rapp prepares to take his vengeance on the man responsible for his girlfriend's death, but before he can kill the terrorist, the cell is suddenly ambushed by U.S. Special Forces. Upset over the perception that he has been denied his vengeance, Rapp repeatedly stabs the terrorist he was after before being dragged out by the U.S. forces. In a CIA safe house Rapp undergoes 30 days of debriefing before being offered a chance by CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy to join a black operations unit codenamed Orion. Its head, Stan Hurley, is a former U.S. Navy SEAL and a Cold War veteran who trains Rapp and the other potential recruits in asymmetrical warfare.\\r\\nElsewhere, word comes down through intelligence channels that weapons grade nuclear material has gone missing from a decommissioned Russian nuclear facility. The material in question appears to be heading to Iranian hardliners, who are upset with the Iranian government's nuclear deal with the U.S. While verifying the sale of the nuclear material in Poland the plutonium is intercepted by a third party, who eliminates the sellers before vanishing into the crowd. In Virginia, Hurley sees news reports about the incident in Poland and tentatively identifies the perpetrator as a former Navy SEAL and Orion operative believed to have been killed in action and now going by the codename \\"Ghost\\". Hurley's team is sent into Turkey to intercept the buyer \\"Ghost\\" is working for.\\r\\nIn Istanbul, Hurley's team is identified, and the attempted intercept of the trigger device fails. Rapp pursues the buyer to his apartment, and after killing the man, retrieves his laptop. The information leads the team to Rome, where Orion operatives identify a nuclear physicist needed to craft the nuclear material into a functional nuclear weapon. While in Rome, Rapp uncovers a co-worker, Annika, as a foreign agent for Iran. She explains that she is working for the mainstream Iranian faction which is attempting to stop the hardliners from acquiring nuclear material. During a meeting between Hurley and an Iranian contact, Ghost ambushes them and kills the contact and captures Hurley.\\r\\nAt the CIA safe house in Rome, Annika is being moved under guard by two Mossad agents when Rapp intercepts the car and frees her. Working together, both locate the subterranean headquarters \\"Ghost\\" is using to build the nuclear device. After infiltrating the tunnels, Rapp locates and frees a badly injured Hurley, however Annika is captured by \\"Ghost\\" and she kills herself with \\"Ghost's\\" gun before \\"Ghost\\" escapes onto a boat with the nuke. Based on an earlier conversation, Hurley deduces that \\"Ghost\\" intends to make a kamikaze attack against the U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet. Rapp chases after \\"Ghost's\\" boat, while the Sixth Fleet, alerted to the impending nuclear attack through CIA channels, prepares for the attack.\\r\\nAboard \\"Ghost's\\" boat, Rapp kills \\"Ghost\\" and attempts to divert the boat away from the Sixth Fleet to shield the ships from the blast, before throwing the nuclear weapon into the sea before escaping aboard a U.S. Navy helicopter. Seconds later the device detonates, creating a massive sink hole and subsequent tsunami that inundates the Sixth Fleet vessels, but the fleet survives the blast.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the blast, Hurley is recovering from his injuries and notes that Rapp is on vacation in Dubai, while watching news reports indicating that the Iranian faction which tried to obtain the nuclear weapon will win the presidential election. In Dubai, the faction candidate and his escorts enter an elevator in which Rapp is already present, smiling.\\r\\nCBS Films acquired the rights to Flynn's book series in 2008. The New York Times bestseller Consent to Kill was intended to be the first film in a proposed series.[5] Consent to Kill was scheduled to be produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Nick Wechsler; the screenplay was written by Jonathan Lemkin. The studio's last few films had performed poorly, causing them to delay the film's production. Antoine Fuqua was originally attached to direct,[6] with names being rumored to play Mitch Rapp including Gerard Butler, Colin Farrell and Matthew Fox.[7] However, being a prequel novel, American Assassin provided the opportunity to start at the very beginning of the character Rapp's career instead.[8]\\r\\nJeffrey Nachmanoff replaced Ed Zwick as director on February 12, 2012.[9] At the time, Zwick was also writing the script with Marshall Herskovtiz, but another draft was written by Mike Finch in October 2012.[10] A further director and screenwriter change took place with Michael Cuesta and Stephen Schiff, respectively, on board as of March 2016.[11]\\r\\nProduction needed to start by April 30, 2016, or the rights to the film would have reverted to the Vince Flynn Estate.[12]\\r\\nOn October 10, 2012, Chris Hemsworth was believed to have been offered $10 million to play the lead, Mitch Rapp.[10] However, a month later, it was revealed Hemsworth had turned down the role due to scheduling issues.[13] On May 10, 2016, after being \\"courted for months\\",[14] Dylan O'Brien was cast in the lead role with the \\"idea that OBriens Mitch Rapp is college aged, and the hope is the actor grows as the series progresses.\\"[15]\\r\\nBruce Willis was in talks to star as Stan Hurley in September 2012,[16] but Michael Keaton was cast as Rapp's mentor on March 9, 2016.[11] Taylor Kitsch joined the cast on August 18, 2016, as the \\"villainous operative.\\"[17]\\r\\nOn September 7, 2016, Shiva Negar and Sanaa Lathan joined the cast, Negar in a key role as an agent who teams up with Rapp and Hurley,[18] and Lathan as CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy, who is to the Flynn novels what M is to James Bond.

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"American Assassin hits a few easy targets, but without enough style or wit to truly bring its characters to lifeor stand out in a crowded field of more compelling spy thrillers.\\"[34] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score 45 out of 100, based on 30 review, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[35] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale.[32]\\r\\nMatt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, mainly criticizing the film's confused disposition towards revenge: \\"[American Assassin] keeps telling you that revenge poisons the soul and is generally a bad idea while serving up awesome scenes of Mitch and colleagues killing terrorists.... It doesn't take long to figure out where the film's heart lies, and it would've been more honest if it had embraced that impulse from the start.\\"[36] In addition, other negative reviews came from those such as Ed Potton of The Times, who said \\"It's just about conceivable that somebody who has never seen a spy thriller might find some enjoyment in American Assassin\\",[37] and Soren Anderson of the Seattle Times, who wrote, \\"O'Brien is grimly focused as Rapp, but there isn't a lot of electricity in his performance.

It demonstrates that even Jason Bourne lite is better than no Bourne at all, if you're in the mood.\\"[39] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone commended the film, saying \\"Gorgeously shot by Enrique Chediak, American Assassin may be too slick for its own good, but O'Brien cuts deep enough to make you root for a Rapp franchise.\\"[40] Seitz especially praised Michael Keaton's performance as a Cold War veteran, stating that he was the only actor to have built \\"an emotionally cohesive, memorable character\\" despite \\"material that too often mistakes exposition for psychology.\\"[41] Jamie Righetti of Indiewire concluded that while the film presents a \\"predictable\\" script and the \\"bare minimum of fast action and ass-kicking mandated by [its] formula,\\" paired with \\"OBriens charm and an unquestionably tantalizing ending, its possible that audiences havent seen the last of Mitch Rapp.\\"","input":"What book is the american assassin movie based on?"},{"output":"Belgian-style witbier","context":"Blue Moon Belgian White is a Belgian-style witbier brewed by MillerCoors under the name the Blue Moon Brewing Co. It was launched in 1995, and was originally brewed in Golden, Colorado.\\r\\nOriginally called Bellyslide Belgian White, the beer was created by Keith Villa, a brewer at the Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field, Denver, Colorado (owned by the Molson Coors Brewing Company). Blue Moon brewed at the Molson Brewery in Montreal, Quebec, Canada is sold in the USA, as well as exported to Europe.[2] It's sold under the name Belgian Moon in Canada. Blue Moon Brewing Co. is an entity of Tenth and Blake Beer Company, the craft and import division of MillerCoors.\\r\\nThe grain bill for Blue Moon includes malted barley, white wheat, orange peel, coriander and oatsand is usually served with a slice of orange, which its brewmasters claim accentuates the flavor of the brew.[3]\\r\\nAvailable in cans, bottles and kegs, Blue Moon has 5.4% alcohol by volume.[4] In Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado and Utah, the alcohol content of all Blue Moon beers bought in grocery or convenience stores is 3.2% alcohol by weight (approximately 4.0% alcohol by volume). Blue Moon Brews and seasonal brews sold in liquor stores are 5.4% by volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlue Moon has come under fire from the Brewers Association for not stating on the bottle that the beer is made by MillerCoors. The Brewers Association says that this omission allows the Blue Moon Brewing Company to masquerade as an independent craft brewer.[5] Independent craft brewers, such as Greg Koch, CEO of Stone Brewing Co., agree that the multinational conglomerate brewers' use of bottle imagery similar to independent craft beers misleads consumers.[6] In May 2015, a California man filed suit against MillerCoors for the \\"Craft Beer\\" labeling.[7]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Confederation des Brasseries de Belgique (The Confederation of Belgian Breweries) sued the then-named Coors Brewing Company over its use of the term \\"Belgian White\\". The CBB alleged Coors' advertising was misleading, and could confuse American consumers into believing Blue Moon was made in Belgium. Coors at first responded by adding \\"Made in USA\\" and \\"Belgian-style\\" in small print to the bottle labels, but refused to change its advertising or packaging.[8]\\r\\nCoors eventually settled out of court with the CBB, agreeing to change the labeling to \\"Belgian-style Wheat Ale\\".

Partially owing to the significance of the Bible in society, Biblical languages are studied more widely than many other dead languages. Furthermore, some debates exist as to which language is the original language of a particular passage, and about whether a term has been properly translated from an ancient language into modern editions of the Bible. Scholars generally recognize three languages as original biblical languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek.\\r\\nThe Hebrew Bible (Hebrew: ??\\"??), also known as the Tanakh, consists of 39 books. \\"Hebrew\\" in \\"Hebrew Bible\\" may refer to either the Hebrew language or to the Hebrew people who historically used Hebrew as a spoken language, and have continuously used the language in prayer and study, or both. The texts were mainly written in Biblical Hebrew, with some portions (notably in Daniel and Ezra) in Biblical Aramaic. Biblical Hebrew, sometimes called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of the Hebrew language.\\r\\nThe very first translation of the Hebrew Bible was into Greek. This is known as the Septuagint (LXX), which later became the received text of the Old Testament in the Catholic church and the basis of its canon. This began sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century BC, with the first portion of the Hebrew Bible, the Torah, being translated into Koine Greek. Over the next century, other books were translated (or composed) as well. This translation became known as the Septuagint and was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians. It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew (Masoretic Text). This translation was promoted by way of a legend that seventy separate translators all produced identical texts.\\r\\nThe Latin Vulgate by Jerome was based upon the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the Masoretic Text), and on the Greek text for the rest. Other ancient Jewish translations, such as the Aramaic Targums, conform closely to the Masoretic Text, and all medieval and modern Jewish translations are based upon the same. Christian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the Masoretic Text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions.\\r\\nThe books of the Christian New Testament are widely agreed to have originally been written in Greek, specifically Koine Greek, even though some authors often included translations from Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Certainly the Pauline Epistles were written in Greek for Greek-speaking audiences. See Greek primacy for further details. Koine Greek was the popular form of Greek which emerged in post-classical antiquity (c.300 BC ÿ AD 300), and marks the third period in the history of the Greek language.[1] It is also called Alexandrian, Hellenistic, Common, or New Testament Greek.\\r\\nSome scholars believe that some books of the Greek New Testament (in particular, the Gospel of Matthew) are actually translations of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. A famous example of this is the opening to the Gospel of John, which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn. Of these, a small number accept the Syriac Peshitta as representative of the original. See Aramaic primacy.\\r\\nHowever, the received text of the New Testament is Greek and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.","input":"What was the first language of the bible?"},{"output":"the Americas","context":"See List of Quercus species\\r\\nAn oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (/?kw??rk?s/;[1] Latin \\"oak tree\\") of the beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name \\"oak\\" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species.[2]\\r\\nOaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers.[3] The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6ÿ18 months to mature, depending on their species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid,[4] which helps to guard from fungi and insects.[5] The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oak tree is a flowering plant. Oaks may be divided into two genera (sometimes referred to as subgenera) and a number of sections:\\r\\nThe genus Quercus is divided into the following sections:\\r\\nInterspecific hybridization is quite common among oaks but usually between species within the same section only and most common in the white oak group (subgenus Quercus, section Quercus; see List of Quercus species). Inter-section hybrids, except between species of sections Quercus and Mesobalanus, are unknown. Recent systematic studies appear to confirm a high tendency of Quercus species to hybridize because of a combination of factors. White oaks are unable to discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section. Because they are wind pollinated and they have weak internal barriers to hybridization, hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring.[6] Ecological stresses, especially near habitat margins, can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species.[6][7]\\r\\nFrequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world; most notably, hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with copious amounts of introgression, and the evolution of new species.[8] Frequent hybridization and high levels of introgression have caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information.[9] Having high rates of hybridization and introgression produces genetic data that often does not differentiate between two clearly morphologically distinct species, but instead differentiates populations.[10] Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain how oak species are able to remain morphologically and ecologically distinct with such high levels of gene flow, but the phenomenon is still largely a mystery to botanists.\\r\\nThe Fagaceae, or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a very slow evolving clade compared to other angiosperms,[11][12] and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in Quercus pose a great challenge to the concept of a species since a species is often defined as a group of actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.[13] By this definition, many species of Quercus would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and, to a large extent, genetic data.\\r\\nOak wood has a density of about 0.75?g/cm3 (0.43?oz/cu?in) creating great strength and hardness. The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high tannin content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when quartersawn. Oak planking was common on high status Viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London and in the construction of fine furniture. Oak wood, from Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, was used in Europe for the construction of ships, especially naval men of war,[14] until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and veneer production. Barrels in which wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy, Irish whiskey, Scotch whisky and Bourbon whiskey are aged are made from European and American oak. The use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces more powerful wine bouquets. Oak wood chips are used for smoking fish, meat, cheeses,[15] and other foods.\\r\\nJapanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from the manufacturer Yamaha Drums. The higher density of oak gives the drum a brighter and louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as maple and birch. In hill states of India, besides fuelwood and timber, the local people use oak wood for making agricultural implements. The leaves are used as fodder during lean period and bedding for livestock.[16][17]\\r\\nThe bark of the cork oak is used to produce wine stoppers (corks). This species grows in the Mediterranean Sea region, with Portugal, Spain, Algeria, and Morocco producing most of the world's supply.\\r\\nOf the North American oaks, the northern red oak is one of the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin. It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated. If the wood is properly treated with preservatives, it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood. The closed cell structure of white oaks prevents them from absorbing preservatives. With northern red oak, one can blow air through an end grain piece 10?inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. Shumard oak, a member of the red oak subgenus, provides timber which is described as \\"mechanically superior\\" to northern red oak. Cherrybark oak is another type of red oak which provides excellent timber.\\r\\nThe standard for the lumber of the white oak group ÿ all of which is marketed as white oak ÿ is the Quercus alba. White oak is often used to make wine barrels. The wood of the deciduous pedunculate oak and sessile oak accounts for most of the European oak production, but evergreen species, such as Holm oak and cork oak also produce valuable timber.\\r\\nThe bark of the white oak is dried and used in medical preparations. Oak bark is also rich in tannin, and is used by tanners for tanning leather. Acorns are used for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee.\\r\\nOak galls were used for centuries as a main ingredient in iron gall ink, a kind of manuscript ink, harvested at a specific time of year.[citation needed] In Korea, oak bark is used to make shingles for traditional roof construction.\\r\\nOak has been listed as one of the 38 substances used to prepare Bach flower remedies,[18] a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health. However, according to Cancer Research UK, \\"there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer\\".[19]\\r\\nOaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. For example, oak trees are important components of hardwood forests, and certain species are particularly known to grow in associations with members of the Ericaceae in oak-heath forests.[20][21] A number of kinds of truffles, including the two well known varieties, the black Prigord truffle[22] and the white Piedmont truffle,[23] have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. The European pied flycatcher is an example of an animal species that often depends upon oak trees.\\r\\nMany species of oaks are under threat of extinction in the wild, largely due to land use changes, livestock grazing and unsustainable harvesting. For example, over the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood and charcoal.[24] In the USA, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors still imperfectly known, but thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests.[25] In a recent survey, 78 wild oak species have been identified as being in danger of extinction, from a global total of over 500 species.[26] The proportion under threat may be much higher in reality, as there is insufficient information about over 300 species, making it near impossible to form any judgement of their status.\\r\\nIn the Himalayan region of India, oak forests are being invaded by pine forests due to the increase in temperature. The associated species of pine forest may cross frontiers and become new elements of the oak forests.[27]\\r\\nIn eastern North America, rare species of oak trees include scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), chinkapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii), and post oak (Quercus stellata).[28]\\r\\nThe mature trees shed varying numbers of acorns annually. Scientists suggest that shedding excess numbers allows the oaks to satiate nut gathering species, improving the chances of germination. Every four to ten years, certain oak populations will synchronize to produce almost no acorns at all, only to rain them down excessively the following year, known as a \\"mast\\" year. The year preceding the mast year is thought to starve off the mammal populations feeding on the supply, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the overproduction in the mast year that follows.[29][30] This is necessary to the survival of any given oak species, as only one in 10,000 acorns results in an eventual tree.[31]\\r\\nBeginning November 1, 2011, a project began to sequence the entire oak genome. The goal of the project is to create a high resolution sequence of the Quercus robur genome, and to study genetic diversity by comparison of the genomes of different species.[32] Current research has compiled genomic data from many different sources and techniques to create a genome map with 89% coverage of the genome. The project is still in the process of annotating this genome.[33]\\r\\nSudden oak death (Phytophthora ramorum) is a water mould that can kill oaks within just a few weeks. Oak wilt, caused by the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum (a fungus closely related to Dutch elm disease), is also a lethal disease of some oaks, particularly the red oaks (the white oaks can be infected but generally live longer). Other dangers include wood-boring beetles, as well as root rot in older trees which may not be apparent on the outside, often being discovered only when the trees come down in a strong gale. Oak apples are galls on oaks made by the gall wasp. The female kermes scale causes galls to grow on kermes oak. Oaks are used as food plants by the larvae of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species such as the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, which can defoliate oak and other broadleaved tree species in North America.[34]\\r\\nA considerable number of galls are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, roots, etc. Examples are oak artichoke gall, oak marble gall, oak apple gall, knopper gall, and spangle gall.\\r\\nA number of species of fungus cause powdery mildew on oak species. In Europe the species Erysiphe alphitoides is the most common cause.[35]\\r\\nA new and yet little understood disease of mature oaks, acute oak decline, has been reported in parts of the UK since 2009.[36]\\r\\nOak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea) has become a serious threat in the UK since 2006. The caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees, and are hazardous to human health; their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems.[37]\\r\\nIn California, oaks are affected by the fungal disease Foamy bark canker.\\r\\nThe leaves and acorns of the oak tree are poisonous to cattle, horses, sheep, and goats in large amounts due to the toxin tannic acid, and cause kidney damage and gastroenteritis. Symptoms of poisoning include lack of appetite, depression, constipation, diarrhea (which may contain blood), blood in urine, and colic. The exception to livestock and oak toxicity is the domestic pig, which may be fed entirely on acorns in the right conditions, and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish dehesa and the English system of pannage) for hundreds of years.\\r\\nAcorns are also edible to humans, after leaching of the tannins.[38]\\r\\nThe oak is a common symbol of strength and endurance and has been chosen as the national tree of many countries. Already an ancient Germanic symbol (in the form of the Donar Oak, for instance), certainly since the early nineteenth century, it stands for the nation of Germany and oak branches are thus displayed on some German coins, both of the former Deutsche Mark and the current Euro currency.[39] In 2004 the Arbor Day Foundation[40] held a vote for the official National Tree of the United States of America. In November 2004, the United States Congress passed legislation designating the oak as America's National Tree.[41]\\r\\nOther countries have also designated the oak as their national tree including Bulgaria, Cyprus (Golden Oak), England, Estonia, France, Germany, Moldova, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Wales.[42]\\r\\nThe oak is the emblem of County Londonderry in Northern Ireland, as a vast amount of the county was covered in forests of the tree until relatively recently. The name of the county comes from the city of Derry, which originally in Irish was known as Doire meaning oak.\\r\\nThe Irish County Kildare derives its name from the town of Kildare which originally in Irish was Cill Dara meaning the Church of the Oak or Oak Church.\\r\\nIowa designated the oak as its official state tree in 1961; and the White Oak is the state tree of Connecticut, Illinois and Maryland. The Northern Red Oak is the provincial tree of Prince Edward Island, as well as the state tree of New Jersey.

It is also known as the Iron Eagle. During the Third Reich of Nazi Germany, oak leaves were used for military valor decoration on the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross. They also symbolize rank in the United States Armed Forces. A gold oak leaf indicates an O-4 (Major or Lt. Commander), whereas a silver oak leaf indicates an O-5 (Lt. Colonel or Commander). Arrangements of oak leaves, acorns and sprigs indicate different branches of the United States Navy Staff corps officers.[43] Oak leaves are embroidered onto the covers (hats) worn by field grade officers and flag officers in the United States armed services.\\r\\nIf a member of the United States Army or Air Force earns multiple awards of the same medal, then instead of wearing a ribbon or medal for each award, he or she wears one metal representation of an \\"oak leaf cluster\\" attached to the appropriate ribbon for each subsequent award.[44]\\r\\nThe oak tree is used as a symbol by a number of political parties. It is the symbol of Toryism (on account of the Royal Oak) and the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom,[45] and formerly of the Progressive Democrats in Ireland[46] and the Democrats of the Left in Italy. In the cultural arena, the oakleaf is the symbol of the National Trust (UK), The Woodland Trust, and The Royal Oak Foundation.[43]\\r\\nIn Greek mythology, the oak is the tree sacred to Zeus, king of the gods. In Zeus's oracle in Dodona, Epirus, the sacred oak was the centerpiece of the precinct, and the priests would divine the pronouncements of the god by interpreting the rustling of the oak's leaves.[47]\\r\\nIn Baltic and Slavic mythology, the oak is the sacred tree of Latvian Prkons, Lithuanian Perknas, Prussian Perkns and Slavic Perun,[48] the god of thunder and one of the most important deities in the Baltic and Slavic pantheons.\\r\\nIn Celtic polytheism, the name of the oak tree was part of the Proto-Celtic word for 'druid': *derwo-weyd- > *druwid-?; however, Proto-Celtic *derwo- (and *dru-) can also be adjectives for 'strong' and 'firm', so Ranko Matasovic interprets that *druwid- may mean 'strong knowledge'. As in other Indo-European faiths, Taranis, being a thunder god, was associated with the oak tree.[49] The Indo-Europeans worshiped the oak and connected it with a thunder or lightning god; \\"tree\\" and drus may also be cognate with \\"Druid,\\" the Celtic priest to whom the oak was sacred. There has even been a study that shows that oaks are more likely to be struck by lightning than any other tree of the same height.[50]\\r\\nIn Norse mythology, the oak was sacred to the thunder god, Thor. Thor's Oak was a sacred tree of the Germanic Chatti tribe.\\r\\nIn the Bible, the oak tree at Shechem is the site where Jacob buries the foreign gods of his people (Gen. 35:4) .

The name Pennsylvania, which translates roughly as \\"Penn's Woods\\",[1] was created by combining the Penn surname (in honor of William's father, Admiral Sir William Penn) with the Latin word sylvania, meaning \\"forest land.\\" The Province of Pennsylvania was one of the two major Restoration colonies, the other being the Province of Carolina. The proprietary colony's charter remained in the hands of the Penn family until the American Revolution, when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was created and became one of the original thirteen states.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonial government, established in 1682 by Penn's Frame of Government, consisted of an appointed Governor, the proprietor (William Penn), a 72-member Provincial Council, and a larger General Assembly. The General Assembly, also known as the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, was the largest and most representative branch of government, but had little power.\\r\\nSucceeding Frames of Government, also known as the Charter of Privileges, were produced in 1683, 1696 and 1701. The fourth Frame (Charter of Privileges) remained in effect until the American Revolution. At that time, the Provincial Assembly was deemed too moderate by the revolutionaries, who ignored the Assembly and held a convention which produced the Constitution of 1776 for the newly established Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, creating a new General Assembly in the process.\\r\\nWilliam Penn (14 October 1644 ÿ 30 July 1718) was an English real estate entrepreneur, philosopher, early Quaker and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, the English North American colony and the future Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Indians. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed.\\r\\nThe province was divided first into 5 counties, plus the three \\"lower counties on Delaware Bay.\\" The easternmost, Bucks County, extended northwest from Bensalem all the way to what is currently Bradford County, and included not only present-day Bucks County, but also the Poconos, the Lehigh Valley, and Carbon and part of Schuylkill County. Philadelphia County is present-day Philadelphia City (which also happens to be its own county). Montgomery County was west of Bucks and northwest of Philadelphia, and extended along the Schuylkill River to the area presently known as Minersville, in Schuylkill County. Chester County extended along the southern border of Pennsylvania (the MasonÿDixon line) from Marcus Hook to the western border of the province. The remainder of the province, which is now North Central and Northwestern Pennsylvania, was part of an enlarged Northumberland County (Northumberland County presently sits between Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre along the Susquehanna River).\\r\\n\\"The lower counties on Delaware,\\" a separate colony within the province, constituted the same three counties that constitute the present State of Delaware: New Castle, the northernmost, Sussex, the southernmost, and Kent, which fell between New Castle and Sussex County. Their borders remain unchanged to this day.\\r\\nWilliam Penn and his fellow Quakers heavily imprinted their religious values on the early Pennsylvanian government. The Charter of Privileges extended religious freedom to everyone monotheists and government was initially open to all Christians. Until the French and Indian War Pennsylvania had no military, few taxes and no public debt. It also encouraged the rapid growth of Philadelphia into America's most important city, and of the Pennsylvania Dutch Country hinterlands, where German (or \\"Deutsch\\") religions and political refugees prospered on the fertile soil and spirit of cultural creativeness. Among the first groups were the Mennonites, who founded Germantown in 1683; and the Amish, who established the Northkill Amish Settlement in 1740. 1751 was an auspicious year for the colony. Pennsylvania Hospital, the first hospital in the British American colonies,[2] and The Academy and College of Philadelphia, the predecessor to the private University of Pennsylvania,[3] both opened. Benjamin Franklin founded both of these institutions along with Philadelphia's Union Fire Company fifteen years earlier in 1736.[4] Likewise in 1751, the Pennsylvania State House ordered a new bell which would become known as the Liberty Bell for the new bell tower being built in the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia.\\r\\nWilliam Penn had mandated fair dealings with Native Americans. This led to significantly better relations with the local Native tribes (mainly the Lenape and Susquehanna) than most other colonies had. The Quakers had previously treated Indians with respect, bought land from them voluntarily, and had even representation of Indians and Whites on juries. According to Voltaire, the Shackamaxon Treaty was \\"the only treaty between Indians and Christians that was never sworn to and that was never broken.\\"[5] The Quakers also refused to provide any assistance to New England's Indian wars.\\r\\nIn 1737, the Colony exchanged a great deal of its political goodwill with the native Lenape for more land. The colonial administrators claimed that they had a deed dating to the 1680s in which the Lenape-Delaware had promised to sell a portion of land beginning between the junction of the Delaware River and Lehigh River (present Easton, Pennsylvania) \\"as far west as a man could walk in a day and a half.\\" This purchase has become known as the Walking Purchase. Although the document was most likely a forgery, the Lenape did not realize that. Provincial Secretary James Logan set in motion a plan that would grab as much land as they could possibly get and hired the three fastest runners in the colony to run out the purchase on a trail which had been cleared by other members of the colony beforehand. The pace was so intense that only one runner actually completed the \\"walk,\\" covering an astonishing 70 miles (110?km). This netted the Penns 1,200,000 acres (4,900?km2) of land in what is now northeastern Pennsylvania, an area roughly equivalent to the size of the state of Rhode Island in the purchase. The area of the purchase covers all or part of what are now Pike, Monroe, Carbon, Schuylkill, Northampton, Lehigh and Bucks counties. The Lenape tribe fought for the next 19 years to have the treaty annulled, but to no avail. The Lenape-Delaware were forced into the Shamokin and Wyoming Valleys, which were already overcrowded with other displaced tribes.\\r\\nAs the colony grew, colonists and British military forces came into confrontation with Natives in the Western half of the state. Britain fought for control of the neighboring Ohio Country with France during the French and Indian War, and following the British victory the territory was formally ceded to them in 1763 and became part of the British Empire.\\r\\nWith the war just over and Pontiac's War beginning, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 banned colonization beyond the Appalachian Mountains in an effort to prevent settlers settling lands which the Native Americans considered their own. This proclamation affected Pennsylvanians and Virginians the most, as they had been racing towards the lands surrounding Fort Pitt (modern-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, consisting of the Chief Justice and at least one other judge, was founded in 1722 and sat in Philadelphia twice a year.\\r\\nCoordinates: 401746N 753032W? / ?40.296N 75.509W? / 40.296; -75.509","input":"What type of colony was pennsylvania when it was founded?"},{"output":"October 31, 1994","context":"Joshua Tree National Park is an American national park in southeastern California, east of Los Angeles, near Palm Springs. The park is named for the Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) native to the Mojave Desert. Originally declared a national monument in 1936, Joshua Tree was redesignated as a national park in 1994 when the U.S. Congress passed the California Desert Protection Act.[3] Encompassing a total of 790,636 acres (1,235.37?sq?mi; 3,199.59?km2)[1]an area slightly larger than the state of Rhode Islandthe park includes 429,690 acres (671.39?sq?mi; 1,738.89?km2) of designated wilderness. Straddling the border between San Bernardino County and Riverside County, the park includes parts of two deserts, each an ecosystem whose characteristics are determined primarily by elevation: the higher Mojave Desert and the lower Colorado Desert. The Little San Bernardino Mountains traverse the southwest edge of the park.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known residents of the land in and around what later became Joshua Tree National Park were the people of the Pinto Culture, who lived and hunted here between 8000 and 4000 BCE.[5] Their stone tools and spear points, discovered in the Pinto Basin in the 1930s, suggest that they hunted game and gathered seasonal plants, but little else is known about them.[5] Later residents included the Serrano, the Cahuilla, and the Chemehuevi peoples. All three lived at times in small villages in or near water, particularly the Oasis of Mara in what non-aboriginals later called Twentynine Palms. They were hunter-gatherers who subsisted largely on plant foods supplemented by small game, amphibians, and reptiles while using other plants for making medicines, bows and arrows, baskets, and other articles of daily life.[6] A fourth group, the Mojaves, used the local resources as they traveled along trails between the Colorado River and the Pacific coast. In the 21st century, small numbers of all four peoples live in the region near the park; the Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians, descendants of the Chemehuevi, own a reservation in Twentynine Palms.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1772, a group of Spaniards led by Pedro Fages, made the first European sightings of Joshua trees while pursuing native converts to Christianity who had run away from a mission in San Diego. By 1823, the year Mexico achieved independence from Spain, a Mexican expedition from Los Angeles, in what was then Alta California, is thought to have explored as far east as the Eagle Mountains in what later became the park. Three years later, Jedediah Smith led a group of American fur trappers and explorers along the nearby Mojave Trail, and others soon followed. Two decades after that, the United States defeated Mexico in the MexicanÿAmerican War (1846ÿ48) and took over about half of Mexico's original territory, including California and the future parkland.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1870, non-natives began grazing cattle on the tall grasses that grew in the park. In 1888, a gang of cattle rustlers moved into the region near the Oasis of Mara. Led by brothers James. B. and William S. McHaney, they hid stolen cattle in a box canyon at Cow Camp.[9] Throughout the region, ranchers dug wells and built rainwater catchments called \\"tanks\\", such as White Tank and Barker Dam.[10]  In 1900,[11] C. O. Barker, a miner and cattleman, built the original Barker Dam, later improved by William \\"Bill\\" Keys, a rancher.[12] Grazing continued in the park through 1945.[10] Barker Dam was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1975.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the 1860s and the 1940s, miners worked about 300 pit mines, mostly small, in what later became the park.[13] The most successful, the Lost Horse Mine, produced gold and silver worth about $5?million in today's currency.[14] Johnny Lang and others, the original owners of the Lost Horse Mine, installed a two-stamp mill to process ore at the site, and the next owner, J.D. Ryan, replaced it with a 10-stamp steam-powered mill.[14] Ryan pumped water from his ranch to the mill and cut timber from the nearby hills to heat water to make steam.[14] Most of the structures associated with the mine fell apart, and for safety reasons the National Park Service plugged the mine, which had collapsed.[14] The Desert Queen Mine on Keys' Desert Queen Ranch was another productive gold mine.[13] In the early 1930s, Keys bought a gasoline-powered two-stamp mill, the Wall Street Mill, and moved it to his ranch to process ore.[15] The ranch and mill were added to the NRHP in 1975[15][16] and the mine in 1976.[17] Some of the mines in the park yielded copper, zinc, and iron.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 10, 1936, after Minerva Hoyt and others persuaded the state and federal governments to protect the area, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the power of the 1906 Antiquities Act to establish Joshua Tree National Monument. It protected about 825,000 acres (334,000?ha).[18] In 1950, the size of the park was reduced by about 290,000 acres to open the land to more mining.[19] The park was elevated to a National Park on October 31, 1994, by the Desert Protection Act, which also added 234,000 acres to the park.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe higher and cooler Mojave Desert is the special habitat of Yucca brevifolia, the Joshua tree for which the park is named. It occurs in patterns from dense forests to distantly spaced specimens. In addition to Joshua tree forests, the western part of the park includes some of the most interesting geologic displays found in California's deserts. The dominant geologic features of this landscape are hills of bare rock, usually broken up into loose boulders. These hills are popular among rock climbing and scrambling enthusiasts. The flatland between these hills is sparsely forested with Joshua trees. Together with the boulder piles and Skull Rock, the trees make the landscape otherworldly. Temperatures are most comfortable in the spring and fall, with an average high/low of 85 and 50?F (29 and 10?C) respectively. Winter brings cooler days, around 60?F (16?C), and freezing nights. It occasionally snows at higher elevations. Summers are hot, over 100?F (38?C) during the day and not cooling much below 75?F (24?C) until the early hours of the morning.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoshua trees dominate the open spaces of the park, but in among the rock outcroppings are pi?on pine, California juniper (Juniperus californica), Quercus turbinella (desert scrub oak), Quercus john-tuckeri (Tucker's oak), and Quercus cornelius-mulleri (Muller's oak).[22] These communities are under some stress, however, as the climate was wetter until the 1930s, with the same hot and dry conditions that provoked the Dust Bowl affecting the local climate. These cycles were nothing new, but the original vegetation did not prosper when wetter cycles returned. The difference may have been human development. Cattle grazing took out some of the natural cover and made it less resistant to the changes. But the bigger problem seems to be invasive species, such as cheatgrass, which during wetter periods fill in below and among the pines and oak. In drier times, they die back, but do not quickly decompose. This makes wildfires hotter and more destructive, which kills some of the trees that would have otherwise survived. When the area regenerates, these non-native grasses form a thick layer of turf that makes it harder for the pine and oak seedlings to get a roothold.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow 3,000 feet (910?m), the Colorado Desert encompasses the eastern part of the park and features habitats of Creosote bush scrub, Ocotillo, desert Saltbush and mixed scrub including Yucca and Cholla cactus (Cylindropuntia bigelovii). There are areas of such cactus density they appear as natural gardens. The lower Coachella Valley is on the southeastern side of the Park with sandy soil grasslands and desert dunes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only palm native to California, the California Fan Palm (Washingtonia filifera), occurs naturally in five oases in the park, rare areas where water occurs naturally year round and all forms of wildlife abound.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park's oldest rocks, Pinto gneiss among them, are 1.7 billion years old. They are exposed in places on the park's surface in the Cottonwood, Pinto, and Eagle mountains. Much later, from 250 to 75 million years ago, tectonic plate movements forced volcanic material toward the surface at this location and formed granites, including monzogranite common to the Wonderland of Rocks, parts of the Pinto, Eagle, and Coxcomb mountains, and elsewhere. Erosion eventually exposed the harder rocks, gneiss and granite, in the uplands and reduced the softer rocks to debris that filled the canyons and basins between the ranges. The debris, moved by gravity and water, formed alluvial fans at the mouths of canyons as well as bajadas where the alluvial fans overlapped.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rock formations of Joshua Tree National Park owe their shape partly to groundwater, which filtered through the roughly rectangular joints of the monzonite and eroded the corners and edges of blocks of stone, and to flash floods, which washed away covering ground and left piles of rounded boulders.[24] These prominent outcrops are known as inselbergs.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the park's six blocks of mountains, fivethe Little San Bernardino, Hexie, Pinto, Cottonwood, and Eagleare among the Transverse Ranges, which trend generally eastÿwest in locations between the Eagle Mountains on the east and the northern Channel Islands, in the Pacific Ocean west of Santa Barbara, on the west. Tectonic forces along the San Andreas Fault system compressed and lifted the crust material that formed these ranges. The San Andreas Fault itself passes southwest of the park, but related parallel faults including the Dillon, Blue Cut, and Pinto, run through the park, and movements along them have caused earthquakes. The easternmost range in the park, the Coxcomb Mountains, runs generally northÿsouth and is part of the Basin and Range Province.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nNine established campgrounds exist in the park, two of which (Black Rock Campground and Cottonwood Campground) provide water and flush toilets. A fee is charged per night for each camping spot.[26] Reservations are accepted at Black Rock Campground, Cottonwood Campground, Indian Cove Campground, and Jumbo Rocks Campground for October through May, while the other campgrounds are first-come, first-served. Backcountry camping, for those who wish to backpack, is permitted with a few regulations.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several hiking trails within the park, many of which can be accessed from a campground. Shorter trails, such as the one mile hike through Hidden Valley, offer a chance to view the beauty of the park without straying too far into the desert. A section of the California Riding and Hiking Trail meanders for 35 miles (56?km) through the western side of the park.[28] The lookout point at Keys View, towards the south of the park, offers views of the Coachella Valley, the Salton Sea, the San Andreas Fault, the Santa Rosa Mountains, and the city of Palm Springs.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nNature walks inside the park include:\\r\\n\\r\\nLonger trails include:\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to graffiti on at least 17 sites on trails, officials have closed them to the public. The closed sites include Native American sites, at the Southern California park's Rattlesnake Canyon and Barker Dam. They blame the increase in vandalism on the increased use of social media.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park is popular with rock climbers and was originally a winter practice area while Yosemite Valley and other parts of the Sierra Nevada were snowbound, but later became an area of interest in its own right. There are thousands of named climbing routes, at all levels of difficulty. The routes are typically short, the rocks being rarely more than 230?ft (70?m) in height, but access is usually a short, easy walk through the desert, and it is possible to do a number of interesting climbs in a single day. The rocks are all composed of quartz monzonite, a very rough type of granite made even more so as there is no snow or ice to polish it as in places like Yosemite.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome routes are permanently closed while others are closed temporarily to protect sensitive wildlife in certain seasons. Climbing and bouldering routes that are permanently closed include Energy Crisis, the Schwarzenegger Wall, Zombie Woof Rock, the Maverick Boulder formation, Pictograph Boulder, Shindig, Lonely Stones Area #3, The Shipwreck formation, Indian Wave Boulders (except for Native Arete), and Wormholes. As of  March?14, 2018[update], seasonal closures include the Slatanic Area, Towers of Uncertainty, Patagonia Pile, and Jerry's Quarry.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paved main road allows visitors to drive to major attractions and through the park. The unpaved roads may require a vehicle with high ground clearance, and four-wheel drive. An example is the Geology Tour Road in the center of the park. Visitors with a four-wheel drive vehicle can use this road for a self-guided tour with stops that describe the region's geology.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are over 250 species of bird in the park including resident desert birds such as the greater roadrunner and cactus wren as well as mockingbirds, Le Conte's thrasher, verdin and Gambel's quail. There are also many transient species that may spend only one or two seasons in the park. Noted birding spots in the park include: fan palm oases, Barker Dam and Smith Water Canyon. Queen Valley and Lost Horse Valley also provide good birding but with a different range of species because of the lack of water. These are often good places to see ladder-backed woodpecker and oak titmouse. A USGS Bird Checklist [33] of \\"what, when, and status\\" has 239 species listed for the park.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nJoshua Tree is a popular observing site in Southern California for amateur astronomy and stargazing,[34] along with nearby Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. The park is well known for its naturally dark night skies, which are far away from and largely free of the light pollution typical in the urban areas. The park's elevation and dry desert air, along with the relatively stable atmosphere in the region, often make for excellent seeing conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn clear nights around new moon, the sky darkness of Joshua Tree is rated a Class 2ÿ4 on the Bortle scale.[35][36] This ranges from an \\"average dark sky\\" (Class 2) in the easternmost region of the park to a sky quality typical of a rural/suburban transition (Class 4) in the western regions near Palm Springs.[36][37] In the easternmost regions of the park, visitors with optimal vision can expect to see the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies with unaided eyes. The central Milky Way appears highly structured to the naked eye from this site, and zodiacal light appears as a faint yellowish glow when visible.[37] In the western regions of the park, the Andromeda Galaxy is still visible, and only the brightest structures around the Galactic Center of the Milky Way can be distinguished; zodicial light is visible halfway to the zenith.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany animals make their homes in Joshua Tree. Birds, lizards, and ground squirrels are most likely to be seen because they are largely active during the day. However, it is at night that desert animals come out to roam. Mostly nocturnal animals include snakes, bighorn sheep, kangaroo rats, coyotes, lynx, and black-tailed jackrabbits.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals that thrive in Joshua Tree often have special adaptations for dealing with limited water and high summer temperatures. The smaller mammals and all reptiles take refuge from the heat underground. Desert mammals make more efficient use of their bodies water supply than does the human body. Reptiles are physiologically adapted to getting along with little water, and birds can fly to water sources when they need to drink. Nevertheless, the springs and seeps in the park are necessary to the survival of many animals.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the reptiles and many small rodents and insects go into an inactive state of hibernation during the winter. However, winter is the time of greatest bird concentrations in the park, because of the presence of many migrant species.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nA good place to view wildlife is at Barker Dam, a short hike from a parking area near Hidden Valley. Desert bighorn sheep and mule deer sometimes stop by the dam for a drink. Tours of the Barker Dam area are available.\\r\\n\\r\\nWildlife of the park includes:\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the park's total land area of 790,636 acres (319,959?ha), 429,690 acres (173,890?ha) are designated wilderness and managed by the National Park Service (NPS) in accordance with the Wilderness Act. The NPS requires registration for overnight camping at specific locations called registration boards. Other requirements include the use of a camp stove (since open campfires are prohibited) and employing Leave No Trace camping techniques (also known as \\"pack it in, pack it out\\").[42] Although bicycles are not allowed in wilderness areas, horses are, but a permit must be obtained in advance for travel in the backcountry.

It was, from the French view before the event, a set piece battle to draw out the Vietnamese and destroy them with superior firepower. The battle occurred between March and May 1954 and culminated in a comprehensive French defeat that influenced negotiations underway at Geneva among several nations over the future of Indochina.\\r\\nAs a result of blunders in French decision-making, the French began an operation to insert, then support, the soldiers at ?i?n Bin Ph?, deep in the hills of northwestern Vietnam. Its purpose was to cut off Viet Minh supply lines into the neighboring Kingdom of Laos, a French ally, and tactically draw the Viet Minh into a major confrontation in order to cripple them. The plan was to resupply the French position by air, and was based on the belief that the Viet Minh had no anti-aircraft capability. The Viet Minh, however, under General V? Nguyn Gip, surrounded and besieged the French. The Viet Minh brought in vast amounts of Soviet made heavy artillery (including antiaircraft guns). They moved these weapons through difficult terrain up the rear slopes of the mountains surrounding the French positions, dug tunnels through the mountain, and placed the artillery pieces overlooking the French encampment. This positioning of the artillery made it nearly impervious to French counter-battery fire.\\r\\nThe Viet Minh opened fire with a massive artillery bombardment in March. After several days the French artillery commander, Charles Piroth, unable to respond with any effective counterbattery fire, committed suicide. The Viet Minh occupied the highlands around ?i?n Bin Ph? and bombarded the French positions. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. The French repeatedly repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions. Supplies and reinforcements were delivered by air, though as the key French positions were overrun, the French perimeter contracted and the air resupply on which the French had placed their hopes became impossible. As the Viet Minh antiaircraft fire took its toll, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached the French. The garrison was overrun in May after a two-month siege, and most of the French forces surrendered. A few of them escaped to Laos. The French government in Paris then resigned, and the new Prime Minister, the left-of-centre Pierre Mends France, supported French withdrawal from Indochina.\\r\\nThe war ended shortly after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords. France agreed to withdraw its forces from all its colonies in French Indochina, while stipulating that Vietnam would be temporarily divided at the 17th parallel, with control of the north given to the Viet Minh as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh, and the south becoming the State of Vietnam, nominally under Emperor B?o ??i, preventing Ho Chi Minh from gaining control of the entire country.[14] The refusal of Ng? ?nh Di?m (the US-supported president of the first Republic of Vietnam [RVN]) to allow elections in 1956, as had been stipulated by the Geneva Conference, eventually led to the Vietnam War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1953, the First Indochina War was not going well for France. A succession of commanders?ÿ Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, Jean tienne Valluy, Roger Blaizot, Marcel Carpentier, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and Raoul Salan?ÿ had proven incapable of suppressing the insurrection of the Viet Minh fighting for independence. During their 1952ÿ53 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swathes of Laos, a French ally and Vietnam's western neighbor, advancing as far as Luang Prabang and the Plain of Jars. The French were unable to slow the Viet Minh advance, who fell back only after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the Hanoi delta region to prepare for a series of offensives against Viet Minh staging areas in northwest Vietnam. They set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including Lai Chau near the Chinese border to the north,[15] N S?n to the west of Hanoi,[16] and the Plain of Jars in northern Laos.[17]\\r\\nIn May 1953, French Premier Ren Mayer appointed Henri Navarre, a trusted colleague, to take command of French Union Forces in Indochina. Mayer had given Navarre a single orderto create military conditions that would lead to an \\"honorable political solution\\".[18] According to military scholar Phillip Davidson,\\r\\nOn arrival, Navarre was shocked by what he found. There had been no long-range plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, was shocked by the \\"school's out\\" attitude of Salan and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the important thing was that they were getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact. They gave little thought to, or concern for, the problems of their successors.[18]\\r\\nSimultaneously, Navarre had been searching for a way to stop the Viet Minh threat to Laos. Colonel Louis Berteil, commander of Mobile Group 7 and Navarre's main planner,[19] formulated the hrisson (\\"hedgehog\\") concept. The French army would establish a fortified airhead by airlifting soldiers adjacent to a key Viet Minh supply line to Laos.[20] They would cut off Viet Minh soldiers fighting in Laos and force them to withdraw. \\"It was an attempt to interdict the enemy's rear area, to stop the flow of supplies and reinforcements, to establish a redoubt in the enemy's rear and disrupt his lines\\".[21]\\r\\nThe hedgehog concept was based on French experiences at the Battle of N S?n. In late November and early December 1952, Gip attacked the French outpost at N S?n, which was essentially an \\"air-land base\\", a fortified camp supplied only by air.[22] The French beat back Gip's forces repeatedly, causing them to suffer very heavy losses. The French hoped that by repeating the strategy on a much larger scale, they would be able to lure Gip into committing the bulk of his forces in a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to decimate the exposed Viet Minh forces. The experience at N S?n convinced Navarre of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrench staff officers disastrously failed to treat seriously several crucial differences between ?i?n Bin Ph? and N S?n: First, at N S?n, the French commanded most of the high ground with overwhelming artillery support.[23] At ?i?n Bin Ph?, however, the Viet Minh controlled much of the high ground around the valley, their artillery far exceeded French expectations, and they outnumbered the French troops four to one.[3] Gip compared ?i?n Bin Ph? to a \\"rice bowl,\\" where his troops occupied the edge and the French the bottom.[citation needed] Second, Gip made a mistake in N S?n by committing his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at ?i?n Bin Ph?, Gip spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Gip possessed.[citation needed] Third, the aerial resupply lines at N S?n were never severed, despite Viet Minh antiaircraft fire. At ?i?n Bin Ph?, Gip amassed antiaircraft batteries that quickly shut down the runway, and made it extremely difficult and costly for the French to bring in reinforcements.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn June, Major General Ren Cogny, the commander of the Tonkin Delta, proposed ?i?n Bin Ph?, which had an old airstrip built by the Japanese during World War II, as a \\"mooring point\\".[24] In another misunderstanding, Cogny envisioned a lightly defended point from which to launch raids; however, Navarre believed that he intended a heavily fortified base capable of withstanding a siege. Navarre selected ?i?n Bin Ph? for the location of Berteil's \\"hedgehog\\" operation. When presented with the plan, every major subordinate officer protested: Colonel Jean-Louis Nicot (commander of the French Air transport fleet), Cogny, and generals Jean Gilles and Jean Dechaux (the ground and air commanders for Operation Castor, the initial airborne assault on ?i?n Bin Ph?). Cogny pointed out, presciently, that \\"we are running the risk of a new N S?n under worse conditions\\".[25] Navarre rejected the criticisms of his proposal and concluded a 17 November conference by declaring that the operation would begin three days later, on 20 November 1953.[26][27]\\r\\nNavarre decided to go ahead with the operation, despite operational difficulties. These later became painfully obvious (but at the time may have been less apparent).[28] He had been repeatedly assured by his intelligence officers that the operation had very little risk of involvement by a strong enemy force.[29] Navarre had previously considered three other ways to defend Laos: mobile warfare, which was impossible given the terrain in Vietnam; a static defense line stretching to Laos, which was not feasible given the number of troops at Navarre's disposal; or placing troops in the Laotian provincial capitals and supplying them by air, which was unworkable due to the distance from Hanoi to Luang Prabang and Vientiane.[30] Navarre believed that he was left only with the hedgehog option, which he characterized as \\"a mediocre solution\\".[31] The French National Defense Committee ultimately agreed that Navarre's responsibility did not include defending Laos. However, its decision (which was drawn up on 13 November) was not delivered to him until 4 December, two weeks after the ?i?n Bin Ph? operation began.[32]\\r\\nOperations at ?i?n Bin Ph? began at 10:35 on the morning of 20 November 1953. In Operation Castor, the French dropped or flew 9,000 troops into the area over three days, including a bulldozer to prepare the airstrip. They were landed at three drop zones: \\"Natasha\\" (northwest), \\"Octavie\\" (southwest), and \\"Simone\\" (southeast) of ?i?n Bin Ph?.[33] The Viet Minh elite 148th Independent Infantry Regiment, headquartered at ?i?n Bin Ph?, reacted \\"instantly and effectively\\". Three of its four battalions, however, were absent that day.[34] Initial operations proceeded well for the French. By the end of November, six parachute battalions had been landed, and the French Army was consolidating its positions.\\r\\nIt was at this time that Gip began his countermoves. He had expected an attack, but could not foresee when or where it would occur. Gip realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon Lai Chau Province and fight a pitched battle at ?i?n Bin Ph?.[35] On 24 November, Gip ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault ?i?n Bin Ph? from Vi?t B?c.[35]\\r\\nStarting in December, the French, under the command of Colonel Christian de Castries, began transforming their anchoring point into a fortress by setting up seven satellite positions. (Each was said to be named after a former mistress of de Castries, although the allegation is probably unfounded, as the eight names begin with letters from the first nine of the alphabet, excluding F.) The fortified headquarters was centrally located, with positions \\"Huguette\\" to the west, \\"Claudine\\" to the south, and \\"Dominique\\" to the northeast.[36] The other positions were \\"Anne-Marie\\" to the northwest, \\"Beatrice\\" to the northeast, \\"Gabrielle\\" to the north, and \\"Isabelle\\" 6?km (3.7?mi) to the south, covering the reserve airstrip.\\r\\nThe choice of de Castries as the local commander at ?i?n Bin Ph? was, in retrospect, a bad one. Navarre had picked de Castries, a cavalryman in the 18th-century tradition,[37] because Navarre envisioned ?i?n Bin Ph? as a mobile battle. ?i?n Bin Ph? required someone adept at World War I-style trench warfare, something for which de Castries was not suited.[36]\\r\\nThe arrival of the 316th Viet Minh Division prompted Cogny to order the evacuation of the Lai Chau garrison to ?i?n Bin Ph?, exactly as Gip had anticipated. En route, they were virtually annihilated by the Viet Minh. \\"Of the 2,100 men who left Lai Chau on 9 December, only 185 made it to ?i?n Bin Ph? on 22 December. The rest had been killed, captured, or deserted\\".[38] The Viet Minh troops converged on ?i?n Bin Ph?.\\r\\nFrench military forces had committed 10,800 troops, together with yet more reinforcements, totalling nearly 16,000 men, to the defense of a monsoon-affected valley surrounded by heavily-wooded hills and high ground that had not been secured. Artillery as well as ten American M24 Chaffee light tanks and numerous aircraft (attack and supply types) were committed to the garrison. This included France's regular troops (notably elite paratrooper units, plus those of the artillery), French Foreign Legionnaires, Algerian and Moroccan tirailleurs (colonial mercenaries of North Africa) and locally-recruited Indochinese (Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian) infantry.\\r\\nIn comparison, all together, the Viet Minh had moved up to 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the French-held valley, totalling five divisions, including the 351st Heavy Division, which was an artillery formation and was entirely equipped with medium artillery, such as the US M101 105mm howitzer, supplied by the neighbouring People's Republic of China (PRC), together with some heavier field-guns as well as anti-aircraft artillery.[5] Various types of artillery and anti-aircraft guns (mainly of Soviet origin), which outnumbered their French counterparts by about four to one,[5] were moved into strategic positions and locations overlooking the valley and the French forces based there. The French garrison came under sporadic direct artillery fire from the Viet Minh for the first time on 31 January 1954 and patrols encountered the Viet Minh troops in all directions around them. The French were completely surrounded.[39]\\r\\nThe Viet Minh assault began in earnest on 13 March 1954 with an attack on outpost \\"Beatrice\\". Viet Minh artillery opened a fierce bombardment of the fortification and French command was disrupted at 18:15 when a shell hit the French command post, killing the Legionnaire commander Major Paul Pegot and his entire staff. A few minutes later, Colonel Jules Gaucher, commander of the entire northern sector, was killed by Viet Minh artillery. The Viet Minh 312th Division then launched a massive infantry assault, using sappers to defeat French obstacles. French resistance at Beatrice collapsed shortly after midnight following a fierce battle. Roughly 500 French legionnaires were killed. The French estimated that Viet Minh losses totalled 600 dead and 1,200 wounded.[40] The French launched a counterattack against \\"Beatrice\\" on the following morning, but it was quickly beaten back by Viet Minh artillery. The victory at \\"Beatrice\\" \\"galvanized the morale\\" of the Viet Minh troops.[40]\\r\\nMuch to French disbelief, the Viet Minh had employed direct artillery fire, in which each gun crew does its own artillery spotting (as opposed to indirect fire, in which guns are massed further away from the target, out of direct line of sight, and rely on a forward artillery spotter). Indirect artillery, generally held as being far superior to direct fire, requires experienced, well-trained crews and good communications, which the Viet Minh lacked.[41] Navarre wrote that, \\"Under the influence of Chinese advisers, the Viet Minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods. The artillery had been dug in by single pieces...They were installed in shellproof dugouts, and fire point-blank from portholes...This way of using artillery and AA guns was possible only with the expansive ant holes at the disposal of the Vietminh and was to make shambles of all the estimates of our own artillerymen.\\"[42] Two days later, the French artillery commander, Colonel Charles Piroth, distraught at his inability to bring counterfire on the well-camouflaged Viet Minh batteries, went into his dugout and committed suicide with a hand grenade.[43] He was buried there in secret to prevent loss of morale among the French troops.[43]\\r\\nFollowing a five-hour cease fire on the morning of 14 March, Viet Minh artillery resumed pounding French positions. The air strip, already closed since 16:00 the day before due to a light bombardment, was now put permanently out of commission.[44] Any further French supplies would have to be delivered by parachute.[45] That night, the Viet Minh launched an attack on \\"Gabrielle\\", held by an elite Algerian battalion. The attack began with a concentrated artillery barrage at 17:00. This was very effective and stunned the defenders. Two regiments from the crack 308th Division attacked starting at 20:00. At 04:00 the following morning, an artillery shell hit the battalion headquarters, severely wounding the battalion commander and most of his staff.[45]\\r\\nDe Castries ordered a counterattack to relieve \\"Gabrielle\\". However, Colonel Pierre Langlais, in forming the counterattack, chose to rely on the 5th Vietnamese Parachute Battalion, which had jumped in the day before and was exhausted.[46] Although some elements of the counterattack reached \\"Gabrielle\\", most were paralyzed by Viet Minh artillery and took heavy losses. At 08:00 the next day, the Algerian battalion fell back, abandoning \\"Gabrielle\\" to the Viet Minh. The French lost around 1,000 men defending Gabrielle, and the Viet Minh between 1,000 and 2,000 attacking the strongpoint.[46] The loss of the outpost \\"Beatrice\\" and now \\"Gabrielle\\", allowed almost pinpoint artillery to be rained down for the rest of the battle and cut off any air resupply using the airstrip, and this dictated the resulting events.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\"Anne-Marie\\" was defended by Tai troops, members of a Vietnamese ethnic minority loyal to the French. For weeks, Gip had distributed subversive propaganda leaflets, telling the Tais that this was not their fight. The fall of \\"Beatrice\\" and \\"Gabrielle\\" had severely demoralized them. On the morning of 17 March, under the cover of fog, the bulk of the Tais left or defected. The French and the few remaining Tais on \\"Anne-Marie\\" were then forced to withdraw.[47]\\r\\n17 March through 30 March saw a lull in fighting. The Viet Minh further tightened the noose around the French central area (formed by the strongpoints \\"Huguette\\", \\"Dominique\\", \\"Claudine\\", and \\"Eliane\\"), effectively cutting off Isabelle and its 1,809 personnel.[48] During this lull, the French suffered from a serious crisis of command. \\"It had become painfully evident to the senior officers within the encircled garrison ÿ and even to Cogny at Hanoi ÿ that de Castries was incompetent to conduct the defense of Dien Bien Phu. Even more critical, after the fall of the northern outposts, he isolated himself in his bunker so that he had, in effect, relinquished his command authority\\".[49] On 17 March, Cogny attempted to fly into ?i?n Bin Ph? to take command, but his plane was driven off by antiaircraft fire. Cogny considered parachuting into the encircled garrison, but his staff talked him out of it.[49]\\r\\nDe Castries' seclusion in his bunker, combined with his superiors' inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum within the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which later became a matter of historical debate. The historian Bernard Fall records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They told him he would retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it.[50] De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the \\"truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu\\".[51] Jules Roy, however, makes no mention of this event, and Martin Windrow argues that the \\"paratrooper putsch\\" is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and Marcel Bigeard were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.[52]\\r\\nThe French aerial resupply took heavy losses from Viet Minh machine guns near the landing strip. On 27 March, the Hanoi air transport commander, Nicot, ordered that all supply deliveries be made from 2,000?m (6,600?ft) or higher; losses were expected to remain heavy.[53] De Castries ordered an attack against the Viet Minh machine guns 3?km (1.9?mi) west of ?i?n Bin Ph?. Remarkably, the attack was a complete success, with 350 Viet Minh soldiers killed and seventeen AA machine guns destroyed (French estimate), while the French lost 20 killed and 97 wounded.[54]\\r\\nThe next phase of the battle saw more massed Viet Minh assaults against French positions in the central ?i?n Bin Ph? ÿ at \\"Eliane\\" and \\"Dominique\\" in particular. Those two areas were held by five understrength battalions, composed of Frenchmen, Legionnaires, Vietnamese, North Africans, and Tais.[55] Gip planned to use the tactics from the \\"Beatrice\\" and \\"Gabrielle\\" skirmishes.\\r\\nAt 19:00 on 30 March, the Viet Minh 312th Division captured \\"Dominique 1 and 2\\", making \\"Dominique 3\\" the final outpost between the Viet Minh and the French general headquarters, as well as outflanking all positions east of the river.[56] At this point, the French 4th Colonial Artillery Regiment entered the fight, setting its 105?mm howitzers to zero elevation and firing directly on the Viet Minh attackers, blasting huge holes in their ranks. Another group of French soldiers, near the airfield, opened fire on the Viet Minh with antiaircraft machine guns, forcing the Viet Minh to retreat.[56]\\r\\nThe Viet Minh's simultaneous attacks elsewhere were more successful. The 316th Division captured \\"Eliane 1\\" from its Moroccan defenders, and half of \\"Eliane 2\\" by midnight.[57] On the other side of ?i?n Bin Ph?, the 308th attacked \\"Huguette 7\\", and nearly succeeded in breaking through, but a French sergeant took charge of the defenders and sealed the breach.[57]\\r\\nJust after midnight on 31 March, the French launched a counterattack against \\"Eliane 2\\", and recaptured half of it. Langlais ordered another counterattack the following afternoon against \\"Dominique 2\\" and \\"Eliane 1\\", using virtually \\"everybody left in the garrison who could be trusted to fight\\".[57] The counterattacks allowed the French to retake \\"Dominique 2\\" and \\"Eliane 1\\", but the Viet Minh launched their own renewed assault. The French, who were exhausted and without reserves, fell back from both positions late in the afternoon.[58] Reinforcements were sent north from \\"Isabelle\\", but were attacked en route and fell back to \\"Isabelle\\".\\r\\nShortly after dark on 31 March, Langlais told Major Marcel Bigeard, who was leading the defense at \\"Eliane\\", to fall back across the river. Bigeard refused, saying \\"As long as I have one man alive I won't let go of 'Eliane 4'. Otherwise, Dien Bien Phu is done for.\\"[59] The night of the 31st, the 316th Division attacked \\"Eliane 2\\". Just as it appeared the French were about to be overrun, a few French tanks arrived, and helped push the Viet Minh back. Smaller attacks on \\"Eliane 4\\" were also pushed back. The Viet Minh briefly captured \\"Huguette 7\\", only to be pushed back by a French counterattack at dawn on 1 April.[60]\\r\\nFighting continued in this manner over the next several nights. The Viet Minh repeatedly attacked \\"Eliane 2\\", only to be beaten back. Repeated attempts to reinforce the French garrison by parachute drops were made, but had to be carried out by lone planes at irregular times to avoid excessive casualties from Viet Minh antiaircraft fire. Some reinforcements did arrive, but not enough to replace French casualties.[60]\\r\\nOn 5 April, after a long night of battle, French fighter-bombers and artillery inflicted particularly devastating losses on one Viet Minh regiment, which was caught on open ground. At that point, Gip decided to change tactics. Although Gip still had the same objective ÿ to overrun French defenses east of the river ÿ he decided to employ entrenchment and sapping to try to achieve it.[61]\\r\\nOn 10 April, the French attempted to retake \\"Eliane 1\\", which had been lost eleven days earlier. The loss posed a significant threat to \\"Eliane 4\\", and the French wanted to eliminate that threat. The dawn attack, which Bigeard devised, was preceded by a short, massive artillery barrage, followed by small unit infiltration attacks, followed by mopping-up operations. \\"Eliane 1\\" changed hands several times that day, but by the next morning the French had control of the strongpoint. The Viet Minh attempted to retake it on the evening of 12 April, but were pushed back.[62]\\r\\nAt this point, the morale of the Viet Minh soldiers was greatly lowered due to the massive casualties they had received. During a period of stalemate from 15 April to 1 May, the French intercepted enemy radio messages which told of whole units refusing orders to attack, and communist prisoners said that they were told to advance or be shot by the officers and noncommissioned officers behind them.[63] Worse still, the Viet Minh lacked advanced medical care, with one stating that \\"Nothing strikes at combat morale like the knowledge that if wounded, the soldier will go uncared for\\".[64] To avert the crisis of mutiny, Gip called in fresh reinforcements from Laos.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the fighting at \\"Eliane 1\\", on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded \\"Huguette 1 and 6\\". On 11 April, the garrison of \\"Huguette 1\\" attacked, and was joined by artillery from the garrison of \\"Claudine\\". The goal was to resupply \\"Huguette 6\\" with water and ammunition. The attacks were repeated on the nights of the 14ÿ15 and 16ÿ17 April. While they did succeed in getting some supplies through, the French suffered heavy casualties, which convinced Langlais to abandon \\"Huguette 6\\". Following a failed attempt to link up, on 18 April, the defenders at \\"Huguette 6\\" made a daring break out, but only a few managed to make it to French lines.[65][66] The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against Huguette 1, and overran the fort on the morning of 22 April. With the fall of \\"Huguette 1\\", the Viet Minh took control of more than 90 percent of the airfield, making accurate parachute drops impossible.[67] This caused the landing zone to become perilously small, and effectively choked off much needed supplies.[68] A French attack against \\"Huguette 1\\" later that day was repulsed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\"Isabelle\\" saw only light action until 30 March, when the Viet Minh isolated it and beat back the attempt to send reinforcements north. Following a massive artillery barrage on 30 March, the Viet Minh began employing the same trench warfare tactics that they were using against the central camp. By the end of April, \\"Isabelle\\" had exhausted its water supply and was nearly out of ammunition.[69]\\r\\nThe Viet Minh launched a massed assault against the exhausted defenders on the night of 1 May, overrunning \\"Eliane 1\\", \\"Dominique 3\\", and \\"Huguette 5\\", although the French managed to beat back attacks on \\"Eliane 2\\". On 6 May, the Viet Minh launched another massed attack against \\"Eliane 2\\". The attack included, for the first time, Katyusha rockets.[40] The French artillery fired a \\"TOT\\" (Time on Target) attack, so artillery rounds fired from different positions would strike on target at the same time.[70] This barrage defeated the first assault wave. A few hours later that night, the Viet Minh detonated a mine shaft, blowing \\"Eliane 2\\" up. The Viet Minh attacked again, and within a few hours then had overrun the defenders.[71]\\r\\nOn 7 May, Gip ordered an all-out attack against the remaining French units with over 25,000 Viet Minh against fewer than 3,000 garrison troops. At 17:00, de Castries radioed French headquarters in Hanoi and talked with Cogny.\\r\\nDe Castries: \\"The Viets are everywhere. The situation is very grave. The combat is confused and goes on all about. I feel the end is approaching, but we will fight to the finish.\\"\\r\\nCogny: \\"Of course you will fight to the end. It is out of the question to run up the white flag after your heroic resistance.\\"[37]\\r\\nThe last radio transmission from the French headquarters reported that enemy troops were directly outside the headquarters bunker and that all the positions had been overrun. The radio operator in his last words stated: \\"The enemy has overrun us. We are blowing up everything. Vive la France!\\" That night the garrison made a breakout attempt, in the Camar܇n tradition. While some of the main body managed to break out, none succeeded in escaping from the valley. However at \\"Isabelle\\", a similar attempt later the same night saw about 70 troops, out of 1,700 men in the garrison, escape to Laos.[72] By about 6:20?pm, only one French position, strongpoint Lily, manned by Moroccan soldiers commanded by a French officer, Major Jean Nicholas, had not been overrun. The position surrendered that night when Nicholas personally waved a small white flag (probably a handkerchief) from his rifle.[73]\\r\\nOn 8 May, the Viet Minh counted 11,721 prisoners, of whom 4,436 were wounded.[74] This was the greatest number the Viet Minh had ever captured: one-third of the total captured during the entire war. The prisoners were divided into groups. Able-bodied soldiers were force-marched over 600?km (370?mi) to prison camps to the north and east,[75] where they were intermingled with Viet Minh soldiers to discourage French bombing runs.[76] Hundreds died of disease along the way. The wounded were given basic first aid until the Red Cross arrived, extracted 858 prisoners, and provided better aid to the remainder. Those wounded who were not evacuated by the Red Cross were sent into detention.[77]\\r\\nThe Viet Minh captured 8,000 French and marched them 500 miles on foot to prison camps; less than half survived the march.[78] Of 10,863 prisoners (including Vietnamese fighting for the French), only 3,290 were officially repatriated four months later;[79] however, the losses figure may include the 3,013 prisoners of Vietnamese origin whose eventual fate is unknown.[80]\\r\\nThe garrison constituted roughly a tenth of the total French Union manpower in Indochina.[81] The defeat seriously weakened the position and prestige of the French as previously planned negotiations over the future of Indochina began.\\r\\nThe Geneva Conference opened on 8 May 1954,[82] the day after the surrender of the garrison. Ho Chi Minh entered the conference on the opening day with the news of his troops' victory in the headlines. The resulting agreement temporarily partitioned Vietnam into two zones: the North was administered by the communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam while the South was administered by the French-supported State of Vietnam. The last units of the French Union forces withdrew from Indochina in 1956. This partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956. After the French withdrawal, the United States supported the southern government, under Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, which opposed the Geneva agreement, and which claimed that Ho Chi Minh's forces from the North had been killing Northern loyalists and terrorizing people both north and south. The North was supported by both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Soviet Union (USSR). This arrangement proved tenuous and escalated into the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War), eventually bringing 500,000 American troops into South Vietnam.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrance's defeat in Indochina, coupled with the German destruction of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, as well as with its NATO allies, most importantly, the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from which many of the troops who fought at ?i?n Bin Ph? had been recruited.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1954, six months after the battle at ?i?n Bin Ph? ended, the Algerian War started, and by 1956, both the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates had gained independence. A French board of inquiry, the Catroux Commission, later investigated the defeat.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act, the United States provided the French with material aid during the battle?ÿ aircraft (supplied by the USS?Saipan), weapons, mechanics, 24 CIA/CAT pilots, and U.S. Air Force maintenance crews.[83] The United States, however, intentionally avoided overt direct intervention. In February 1954, following the French occupation of ?i?n Bin Ph? but before the battle, Democratic senator Michael Mansfield asked the United States Defense Secretary, Charles Erwin Wilson, whether the United States would send naval or air units if the French were subjected to greater pressure there, but Wilson replied that \\"for the moment there is no justification for raising United States aid above its present level\\". President Dwight D. Eisenhower also stated, \\"Nobody is more opposed to intervention than I am\\".[83] On 31 March, following the fall of \\"Beatrice\\", \\"Gabrielle\\", and \\"Anne-Marie\\", a panel of U.S. Senators and House Representatives questioned the American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, about the possibility of American involvement. Radford concluded it was too late for the U.S. Air Force to save the French garrison. A proposal for direct intervention was unanimously voted down by the committee, which \\"concluded that intervention was a positive act of war\\".[84]\\r\\nThe United States did covertly participate in the battle. Following a request for help from Henri Navarre, Radford provided two squadrons of B-26 Invader bomber aircraft to support the French. Following this, 37 American transport pilots flew 682 sorties over the course of the battle.[85] Earlier, in order to succeed the pre-?i?n Bin Ph? Operation Castor of November 1953, General Chester McCarty made available 12 additional C-119 Flying Boxcars flown by French crews.[85]\\r\\nTwo of the American pilots, James McGovern, Jr., and Wallace Buford, were killed in action during the siege of ?i?n Bin Ph?.[86] On 25 February 2005, the seven still living American pilots were awarded the French Legion of Honor by Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United States.[85] The role that the American pilots played in this battle had remained little known until 2004. The American historian Erik Kirsinger researched the case for more than a year to establish the facts.[87][88]\\r\\nThe French author Jules Roy suggests that Admiral Radford discussed with the French the possibility of using nuclear weapons in support of the French garrison.[89] Moreover, John Foster Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at ?i?n Bin Ph?,[90] and a similar source claims that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden was aware of the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons in that region.[91]\\r\\nIn January 1968, during the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese Army under V? Nguyn Gip's command initiated a siege and artillery bombardment on the U.S. Marine Corps base at Khe Sanh, South Vietnam. Historians are divided on whether this was a genuine attempt to repeat their success at ?i?n Bin Ph? by forcing the surrender of the Marine base, or else a diversion from the rest of the T?t Offensive, or an example of the North Vietnamese Army keeping its options open. At Khe Sanh, a number of factors were significantly different from ?i?n Bin Ph?. Khe Sanh was much closer to an American supply base (45?km or 28?mi) compared to a French one at ?i?n Bin Ph? (200?km or 120?mi).[92]\\r\\nAt Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines held the high ground, and their artillery forced the North Vietnamese to use their own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at ?i?n Bin Ph?, the French artillery (six 105?mm batteries and one battery of four 155?mm howitzers and mortars[93]) was only sporadically effective;[94] Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.\\r\\nKhe Sanh received 18,000 tons of aerial resupplies during the 77-day battle, whereas during the 167 days that the French forces at ?i?n Bin Ph? held out, they received only 4,000 tons.[94] Also, the US Air Force dropped 114,810 tons of bombs upon the Vietnamese at Khe Sanh ÿ roughly as many as on Japan during 1945 during World War II.[95]\\r\\nMany of the flights operated by the French Air force to evacuate casualties had female flight nurses on board. A total of 15 women served on flights to ?i?n Bin Ph?. One, Genevive de Galard, was stranded there when her plane was destroyed by shellfire while being repaired on the airfield. She remained on the ground providing medical services in the field hospital until the surrender. She was referred to as the \\"Angel of ?i?n Bin Ph?\\". Historians disagree regarding this moniker, with Martin Windrow maintaining that de Galard was referred to by this name by the garrison itself, but Michael Kenney and Bernard Fall maintaining it was added by outside press agencies.[96]\\r\\nThe French forces came to ?i?n Bin Ph? accompanied by two bordels mobiles de campagne, (\\"mobile field brothels\\"), served by Algerian and Vietnamese women.[97] When the siege ended, the Viet Minh sent the surviving Vietnamese women for \\"re-education\\".[98]\\r\\nThis battle was depicted in at least three films:\\r\\nIt is also mentioned in the Billy Joel song \\"We Didn't Start the Fire.\\"\\r\\nToday the battlefield is a large historical site. French positions such as Beatrice, Isabelle, Elaine, Muong Thanh Bridge and De Castries's Bunker have been preserved. Nearly 30 kilometres away from the centre of Dien Bien Phu lays the Viet Minh army complex ranging from shelters and trenches, also preserved in Muong Phang village. A 96-meter underground tunnel connects the working places of General V? Nguyn Gip and General Hong V?n Thi. In addition monuments and memorials to both sides are situated in the region.","input":"What was the result of the battle of dienbien?"},{"output":"the first six to seven months of their lives","context":"The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear[a]) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60ÿ85?cm (24ÿ33?in) and weighs 4ÿ15?kg (9ÿ33?lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.\\r\\nKoalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.\\r\\nKoalas were hunted by indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[1] The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable.[4] The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word koala comes from the Dharug gula. Although the vowel 'u' was originally written in the English orthography as \\"oo\\" (in spellings such as coola or koolah), it was changed to \\"oa\\", possibly in error.[5] Because of the koala's supposed resemblance to a bear, it was often miscalled the koala bear, particularly by early settlers.[6] The generic name, Phascolarctos, is derived from the Greek words phaskolos \\"pouch\\" and arktos \\"bear\\". The specific name, cinereus, is Latin for \\"ash coloured\\".[7]\\r\\nPeramelidae\\r\\nDasyuridae\\r\\nDromiciops\\r\\nPetauroidea\\r\\nPhalangeroidea\\r\\nH. moschatus\\r\\nPotoroinae\\r\\nMacropodinae\\r\\nP. cinereus\\r\\nT. carnifex\\r\\nNgapakaldia\\r\\nD. optatum\\r\\nZ. trilobus\\r\\nN. lavarackorum\\r\\nM. williamsi\\r\\nI. illumidens\\r\\nVombatidae\\r\\nThe koala was given its generic name Phascolarctos in 1816 by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville,[9] who would not give it a specific name until further review. In 1819, German zoologist Georg August Goldfuss gave it the binomial Lipurus cinereus. Because Phascolarctos was published first, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, it has priority as the official name of the genus.[10] French naturalist Anselme Ga?tan Desmarest proposed the name Phascolartos fuscus in 1820, suggesting that the brown-coloured versions were a different species than the grey ones. Other names suggested by European authors included Marodactylus cinereus by Goldfuss in 1820, P.?flindersii by Ren Primevre Lesson in 1827, and P.?koala by John Edward Gray in 1827.[2]\\r\\nThe koala is classified with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia.[11] The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums.[12] The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal,[8] and the koala's lineage was possibly the first to branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.[13]\\r\\nThe modern koala is the only extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once included several genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets.[14] Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species of Perikoala, were around the same size as the modern koala, while others, such as species of Litokoala, were one-half to two-thirds its size.[15] Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early.[14] During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene[14][16] and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa;[14] and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth.[17]\\r\\nDuring the Pliocene and Pleistocene, when Australia experienced changes in climate and vegetation, koala species grew larger.[15] P. cinereus may have emerged as a dwarf form of the giant koala (P.?stirtoni). The reduction in the size of large mammals has been seen as a common phenomenon worldwide during the late Pleistocene, and several Australian mammals, such as the agile wallaby, are traditionally believed to have resulted from this dwarfing. A 2008 study questions this hypothesis, noting that P.?cinereus and P.?stirtoni were sympatric during the middle to late Pleistocene, and possibly as early as the Pliocene.[18] The fossil record of the modern koala extends back at least to the middle Pleistocene.[19]\\r\\nTraditionally, three distinct subspecies have been recognised: the Queensland koala (P.?c. adustus, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales koala (P.?c.?cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala (P.?c.?victor, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala is the smallest of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull.[20][21] The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit.[21] Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation.[22][23] Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene.[24] Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations.[25] In April 2013, scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome.[26]\\r\\nThe koala is a stocky animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail.[27][28] It has a body length of 60ÿ85?cm (24ÿ33?in) and a weight of 4ÿ15?kg (9ÿ33?lb),[28] making it among the largest arboreal marsupials.[29] Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland.[20] The species is sexually dimorphic, with males 50% larger than females. Males are further distinguished from females by their more curved noses[29] and the presence of chest glands, which are visible as hairless patches.[30] As in most marsupials, the male koala has a bifurcated penis,[31] and the female has two lateral vaginas and two separate uteri.[27] The male's penile sheath contains naturally occurring bacteria that play an important role in fertilisation.[32] The female's pouch opening is tightened by a sphincter that keeps the young from falling out.[33]\\r\\nThe pelage of the koala is thicker and longer on the back, and shorter on the belly. The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside.[29] The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown.[27] The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back.[28] The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation.[34] The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. The large forepaws have two opposable digits (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) that allow them to grasp small branches. On the hindpaws, the second and third digits are fused, a typical condition for members of the Diprotodontia, and the attached claws (which are still separate) are used for grooming.[35] As in humans and other primates, koalas have friction ridges on their paws.[36] The animal has a sturdy skeleton and a short, muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that contribute to its climbing and grasping abilities. Additional climbing strength is achieved with thigh muscles that attach to the shinbone lower than other animals.[37] The koala has a cartilaginous pad at the end of the spine that may make it more comfortable when it perches in the fork of a tree.[33]\\r\\nThe koala has one of the smallest brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal,[38] being 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only 19.2?g (0.68?oz).[39] The brain's surface is fairly smooth, typical for a \\"primitive\\" animal.[40] It occupies only 61% of the cranial cavity[38] and is pressed against the inside surface by cerebrospinal fluid. The function of this relatively large amount of fluid is not known, although one possibility is that it acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the brain if the animal falls from a tree.[40] The koala's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain.[38] Because of its small brain, the koala has a limited ability to perform complex, unfamiliar behaviours. For example, when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface, the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves.[41] The koala's olfactory senses are normal, and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility.[38] Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin. Its round ears provide it with good hearing,[33] and it has a well-developed middle ear.[14] A koala's vision is not well developed,[33] and its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits.[29] Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low-pitched sounds (see social spacing, below). Unlike typical mammalian vocal cords, which are folds in the larynx, these organs are placed in the velum (soft palate) and are called velar vocal cords.[42]\\r\\nThe koala has several adaptations for its eucalypt diet, which is of low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre.[43] The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces.[44] Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it is ready to be chewed.[45] The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine,[46] which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy.[44] A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.[47]\\r\\nUnlike kangaroos and eucalyptus-eating possums, koalas are hindgut fermenters, and their digestive retention can last for up to 100 hours in the wild, or up to 200 hours in captivity.[44] This is made possible by the extraordinary length of their caecum200?cm (80?in) long and 10?cm (4?in) in diameterthe largest proportionally of any animal.[48] Koalas can select which food particles to retain for longer fermentation and which to pass through. Large particles typically pass through more quickly, as they would take more time to digest.[44] While the hindgut is proportionally larger in the koala than in other herbivores, only 10% of the animal's energy is obtained from fermentation. Since the koala gains a low amount of energy from its diet, its metabolic rate is half that of a typical mammal,[43] although this can vary between seasons and sexes.[44] The koala conserves water by passing relatively dry faecal pellets high in undigested fibre, and by storing water in the caecum.[46]\\r\\nThe koala's geographic range covers roughly 1,000,000?km2 (390,000?sq?mi), and 30 ecoregions.[49] It extends throughout eastern and southeastern Australia, encompassing northeastern, central and southeastern Queensland, eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and southeastern South Australia. The koala was introduced near Adelaide and on several islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island.[1] The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range.[49] Fossil evidence shows that the koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia during the late Pleistocene. They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by indigenous Australians.[50]\\r\\nIn Queensland, koalas are unevenly distributed and uncommon except in the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they are abundant only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly everywhere. In South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced.[1] Koalas can be found in habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool temperate.[29] In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.[51]\\r\\nKoalas are herbivorous, and while most of their diet consists of eucalypt leaves, they can be found in trees of other genera, such as Acacia, Allocasuarina, Callitris, Leptospermum, and Melaleuca.[52] Although the foliage of over 600 species of Eucalyptus is available, the koala shows a strong preference for around 30.[53] They tend to choose species that have a high protein content and low proportions of fibre and lignin.[46] The most favoured species are Eucalyptus microcorys, E.?tereticornis, and E.?camaldulensis, which, on average, make up more than 20% of their diet.[54] Despite its reputation as a fussy eater, the koala is more generalist than some other marsupial species, such as the greater glider. Since eucalypt leaves have a high water content, the koala does not need to drink often;[52] its daily water turnover rate ranges from 71 to 91 ml/kg of body weight. Although females can meet their water requirements from eating leaves, larger males require additional water found on the ground or in tree hollows.[46] When feeding, a koala holds onto a branch with hindpaws and one forepaw while the other forepaw grasps foliage. Small koalas can move close to the end of a branch, but larger ones stay near the thicker bases.[55] Koalas consume up to 400 grams (14?oz) of leaves a day, spread over four to six feeding sessions.[56] Despite their adaptations to a low-energy lifestyle, they have meagre fat reserves and need to feed often.[57]\\r\\nBecause they get so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 hours a day;[58] only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement.[59] They are predominantly active at night and spend most of their waking hours feeding. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as long as a day.[60] On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree which is cooler than the surrounding air. The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without panting.[61][62] On warm days, a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs dangling.[58] During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy.[60] On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, walking on all fours.[58] The koala usually grooms itself with its hindpaws, but sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.[63]\\r\\nKoalas are asocial animals and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behaviours. In Victoria, home ranges are small and have extensive overlap, while in central Queensland they are larger and overlap less.[64] Koala society appears to consist of \\"residents\\" and \\"transients\\", the former being mostly adult females and the latter males. Resident males appear to be territorial and dominate others with their larger body size.[65] Alpha males tend to establish their territories close to breeding females, while younger males are subordinate until they mature and reach full size.[66] Adult males occasionally venture outside their home ranges; when they do so, dominant ones retain their status.[64] When a male enters a new tree, he marks it by rubbing his chest gland against the trunk or a branch; males have occasionally been observed to dribble urine on the trunk. This scent-marking behaviour probably serves as communication, and individuals are known to sniff the base of a tree before climbing.[67] Scent marking is common during aggressive encounters.[68] Chest gland secretions are complex chemical mixturesabout 40 compounds were identified in one analysisthat vary in composition and concentration with the season and the age of the individual.[69]\\r\\nAdult males communicate with loud bellowslow pitched sounds that consist of snore-like inhalations and resonant exhalations that sound like growls.[70] These sounds are thought to be generated by unique vocal organs found in koalas.[42] Because of their low frequency, these bellows can travel far through air and vegetation.[71] Koalas may bellow at any time of the year, particularly during the breeding season, when it serves to attract females and possibly intimidate other males.[72] They also bellow to advertise their presence to their neighbours when they enter a new tree.[71] These sounds signal the male's actual body size, as well as exaggerate it;[73] females pay more attention to bellows that originate from larger males.[74] Female koalas bellow, though more softly, in addition to making snarls, wails, and screams. These calls are produced when in distress and when making defensive threats.[70] Young koalas squeak when in distress. As they get older, the squeak develops into a \\"squawk\\" produced both when in distress and to show aggression. When another individual climbs over it, a koala makes a low grunt with its mouth closed. Koalas make numerous facial expressions. When snarling, wailing, or squawking, the animal curls the upper lip and points its ears forward. During screams, the lips retract and the ears are drawn back. Females bring their lips forward and raise their ears when agitated.[75]\\r\\nAgonistic behaviour typically consists of squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other.[76] In extreme situations, a male may try to displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or to move to the end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree.[77] Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close.[76] In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.[66]\\r\\nKoalas are seasonal breeders, and births take place from the middle of spring through the summer to early autumn, from October to May. Females in oestrus tend to hold their heads further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant.[78] Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.[79]\\r\\nThe koala's gestation period lasts 33ÿ35 days,[80] and a female gives birth to a single joey (although twins occur on occasion). As with all marsupials, the young are born while at the embryonic stage, weighing only 0.5?g (0.02?oz). However, they have relatively well-developed lips, forelimbs, and shoulders, as well as functioning respiratory, digestive, and urinary systems. The joey crawls into its mother's pouch to continue the rest of its development.[81] Unlike most other marsupials, the koala does not clean her pouch.[82]\\r\\nA female koala has two teats; the joey attaches itself to one of them and suckles for the rest of its pouch life.[81] The koala has one of the lowest milk energy production rates in relation to body size of any mammal. The female makes up for this by lactating for as long as 12 months.[83] At seven weeks of age, the joey's head grows longer and becomes proportionally large, pigmentation begins to develop, and its sex can be determined (the scrotum appears in males and the pouch begins to develop in females). At 13 weeks, the joey weighs around 50?g (1.8?oz) and its head has doubled in size. The eyes begin to open and fine fur grows on the forehead, nape, shoulders, and arms. At 26 weeks, the fully furred animal resembles an adult, and begins to poke its head out of the pouch.[84]\\r\\nAs the young koala approaches six months, the mother begins to prepare it for its eucalyptus diet by predigesting the leaves, producing a faecal pap that the joey eats from her cloacum. The pap is quite different in composition from regular faeces, resembling instead the contents of the caecum, which has a high concentration of bacteria. Eaten for about a month, the pap provides a supplementary source of protein at a transition time from a milk to a leaf diet.[85] The joey fully emerges from the pouch for the first time at six or seven months of age, when it weighs 300ÿ500?g (11ÿ18?oz). It explores its new surroundings cautiously, clinging to its mother for support. By nine months, it weighs over 1?kg (2.2?lb) and develops its adult fur colour. Having permanently left the pouch, it rides on its mother's back for transportation, learning to climb by grasping branches.[86] Gradually, it spends more time away from its mother, and at 12 months it is fully weaned, weighing around 2.5?kg (5.5?lb). When the mother becomes pregnant again, her bond with her previous offspring is permanently severed. Newly weaned young are encouraged to disperse by their mothers' aggressive behaviour towards them.[87]\\r\\nFemales become sexually mature at about three years of age and can then become pregnant; in comparison, males reach sexual maturity when they are about four years old,[88] although they can produce sperm as early as two years.[87] While the chest glands can be functional as early as 18 months of age, males do not begin scent-marking behaviours until they reach sexual maturity.[69] Because the offspring have a long dependent period, female koalas usually breed in alternate years. Favourable environmental factors, such as a plentiful supply of high-quality food trees, allow them to reproduce every year.[89]\\r\\nKoalas may live from 13 to 18 years in the wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more hazardous lives.[90] Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males.[91] Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.[92]\\r\\nKoalas have few predators; dingos and large pythons may prey on them, while birds of prey (such as powerful owls and wedge-tailed eagles) are threats to young. They are generally not subject to external parasites, other than ticks in coastal areas. Koalas may also suffer mange from the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, and skin ulcers from the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, but neither is common. Internal parasites are few and largely harmless.[91] These include the tapeworm Bertiella obesa, commonly found in the intestine, and the nematodes Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus and Durikainema phascolarcti, which are infrequently found in the lungs.[93] In a three-year study of almost 600 koalas admitted to the Australian Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, 73.8% of the animals were infected with at least one species of the parasitic protozoal genus Trypanosoma, the most common of which was T.?irwini.[94]\\r\\nKoalas can be subject to pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria,[91] which can cause keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, and reproductive tract infection.[95] Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations.[96] The koala retrovirus (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) which is similar to AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.[97]\\r\\nThe animals are vulnerable to bushfires due to their slow movements and the flammability of eucalypt trees.[98] The koala instinctively seeks refuge in the higher branches, where it is vulnerable to intense heat and flames. Bushfires also fragment the animal's habitat, which restricts their movement and leads to population decline and loss of genetic diversity.[99] Dehydration and overheating can also prove fatal.[100] Consequently, the koala is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Models of climate change in Australia predict warmer and drier climates, suggesting that the koala's range will shrink in the east and south to more mesic habitats.[101] Droughts also affect the koala's well-being. For example, a severe drought in 1980 caused many Eucalyptus trees to lose their leaves. Subsequently, 63% of the population in southwestern Queensland died, especially young animals that were excluded from prime feeding sites by older, dominant koalas, and recovery of the population was slow.[41] Later, this population declined from an estimated mean population of 59,000 in 1995 to 11,600 in 2009, a reduction attributed largely to hotter and drier conditions resulting from droughts in most years between 2002 and 2007.[102] Another predicted negative outcome of climate change is the effect of elevations in atmospheric CO2 levels on the koala's food supply: increases in CO2 cause Eucalyptus trees to reduce protein and increase tannin concentrations in their leaves, reducing the quality of the food source.[103]\\r\\nThe first written reference of the koala was recorded by John Price, servant of John Hunter, the Governor of New South Wales. Price encountered the \\"cullawine\\" on 26 January 1798, during an expedition to the Blue Mountains,[104] although his account was not published until nearly a century later in Historical Records of Australia.[105] In 1802, French-born explorer Francis Louis Barrallier encountered the animal when his two Aboriginal guides, returning from a hunt, brought back two koala feet they were intending to eat. Barrallier preserved the appendages and sent them and his notes to Hunter's successor, Philip Gidley King, who forwarded them to Joseph Banks. Similar to Price, Barrallier's notes were not published until 1897.[106] Reports of the first capture of a live \\"koolah\\" appeared in The Sydney Gazette in August 1803.[107] Within a few weeks Flinders' astronomer, James Inman, purchased a specimen pair for live shipment to Joseph Banks in England. They were described as 'somewhat larger than the Waumbut (Wombat)'. These encounters helped provide the impetus for King to commission the artist John Lewin to paint watercolours of the animal. Lewin painted three pictures, one of which was subsequently made into a print that was reproduced in Georges Cuvier's The Animal Kingdom (first published in 1827) and several European works on natural history.[108]\\r\\nBotanist Robert Brown was the first to write a detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, based on a female specimen captured near what is now Mount Kembla in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Austrian botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer drew the animal's skull, throat, feet, and paws. Brown's work remained unpublished and largely unnoticed, however, as his field books and notes remained in his possession until his death, when they were bequeathed to the British Museum (Natural History) in London. They were not identified until 1994, while Bauer's koala watercolours were not published until 1989.[109] British surgeon Everard Home included details of the koala based on eyewitness accounts of William Paterson, who had befriended Brown and Bauer during their stay in New South Wales.[110] Home, who in 1808 published his report in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,[111] gave the animal the scientific name Didelphis coola.[112]\\r\\nThe first published image of the koala appeared in George Perry's (1810) natural history work Arcana.[113] Perry called it the \\"New Holland Sloth\\" on account of its perceived similarities to the Central and South American tree-living mammals of genus Bradypus. His disdain for the koala, evident in his description of the animal, was typical of the prevailing early 19th-century British attitude about the primitiveness and oddity of Australian fauna:[114]\\r\\n\\"...?the eye is placed like that of the Sloth, very close to the mouth and nose, which gives it a clumsy awkward appearance, and void of elegance in the combination?... they have little either in their character or appearance to interest the Naturalist or Philosopher. As Nature however provides nothing in vain, we may suppose that even these torpid, senseless creatures are wisely intended to fill up one of the great links of the chain of animated nature?...\\".[115]\\r\\nNaturalist and popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala in his three-volume work The Mammals of Australia (1845ÿ63) and introduced the species, as well as other members of Australia's little-known faunal community, to the general British public.[116] Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London.[117] In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat.[118] English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered just a few years before.[119] Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 The Mammals of Australia.[120]\\r\\nThe first living koala in Britain arrived in 1881, purchased by the Zoological Society of London. As related by prosecutor to the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a washstand fell on it and it was unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity to dissect the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liverparts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens.[121] Scottish embryologist William Caldwellwell known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypusdescribed the uterine development of the koala in 1884,[122] and used the new information to convincingly place the koala and the monotremes into an evolutionary time frame.[123]\\r\\nPrince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, visited the Koala Park Sanctuary in Sydney in 1934[124] and was \\"intensely interested in the bears\\". His photograph, with Noel Burnet, the founder of the park, and a koala, appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald. After World War II, when tourism to Australia increased and the animals were exported to zoos overseas, the koala's international popularity rose. Several political leaders and members of royal families had their pictures taken with koalas, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry, Crown Prince Naruhito, Crown Princess Masako, Pope John Paul II, US President Bill Clinton, Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev, South African President Nelson Mandela,[125] Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.[126]\\r\\nThe koala is well known worldwide and is a major draw for Australian zoos and wildlife parks. It has been featured in advertisements, games, cartoons, and as soft toys.[127] It benefited the national tourism industry by over an estimated billion Australian dollars in 1998, a figure that has since grown.[128] In 1997, half of visitors to Australia, especially those from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, sought out zoos and wildlife parks; about 75% of European and Japanese tourists placed the koala at the top of their list of animals to see.[129] According to biologist Stephen Jackson: \\"If you were to take a straw poll of the animal most closely associated with Australia, it's a fair bet that the koala would come out marginally in front of the kangaroo\\".[127] Factors that contribute to the koala's enduring popularity include its childlike body proportions and teddy bear-like face.[130]\\r\\nThe koala is featured in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that brought them to the continent.[131] Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people from other parts of the world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines.[132] Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy.[133] Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests.[134] The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.[135]\\r\\nEarly European settlers in Australia considered the koala to be a prowling sloth-like animal with a \\"fierce and menacing look\\".[136] At the beginning of the 20th century, the koala's reputation took a more positive turn, largely due to its growing popularity and depiction in several widely circulated children's stories.[137] It is featured in Ethel Pedley's 1899 book Dot and the Kangaroo, in which it is portrayed as the \\"funny native bear\\".[136] Artist Norman Lindsay depicted a more anthropomorphic koala in The Bulletin cartoons, starting in 1904. This character also appeared as Bunyip Bluegum in Lindsay's 1918 book The Magic Pudding.[138] Perhaps the most famous fictional koala is Blinky Bill. Created by Dorothy Wall in 1933, the character appeared in several books and has been the subject of films, TV series, merchandise, and a 1986 environmental song by John Williamson.[139] The first Australian stamp featuring a koala was issued by the Commonwealth in 1930.[140] A television ad campaign for Australia's national airline Qantas, starting in 1967 and running for several decades, featured a live koala (voiced by Howard Morris), who complained that too many tourists were coming to Australia and concluded \\"I hate Qantas\\".[141] The series has been ranked among the greatest commercials of all time.[142]\\r\\nThe song \\"Ode to a Koala Bear\\" appears on the B-side of the 1983 Paul McCartney/Michael Jackson duet single Say Say Say.[139] A koala is the main character in Hanna-Barbera's The Kwicky Koala Show and Nippon Animation's Noozles, both of which were animated cartoons of the early 1980s. Food products shaped like the koala include the Caramello Koala chocolate bar and the bite-sized cookie snack Koala's March. Dadswells Bridge in Victoria features a tourist complex shaped like a giant koala,[125] and the Queensland Reds rugby team has a koala as its mascot.[143] The Platinum Koala coin features the animal on the reverse and Elizabeth II on the obverse.[144]\\r\\nThe drop bear is an imaginary creature in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous version of the koala. This hoax animal is commonly spoken about in tall tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.[145][146][147][148][149][150][151]\\r\\nWhile the koala was previously classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016.[1] Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal to include the koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.[19] In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures is based on a misconception that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is probably less than 100,000.[152]\\r\\nKoalas were hunted for food by Aboriginals. A common technique used to capture the animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark to the end of a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy).[153] According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.[154]\\r\\nThe koala was heavily hunted by European settlers in the early 20th century,[155] largely for its thick, soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for use in rugs, coat linings, muffs, and as trimming on women's garments.[156] Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses. The public outcry over these cullings was probably the first wide-scale environmental issue that rallied Australians. Novelist and social critic Vance Palmer, writing in a letter to The Courier-Mail, expressed the popular sentiment:\\r\\n\\"The shooting of our harmless and lovable native bear is nothing less than barbarous?... No one has ever accused him of spoiling the farmer's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the prickly pear. There is no social vice that can be put down to his account?... He affords no sport to the gun-man?... And he has been almost blotted out already from some areas.\\"[157]\\r\\nDespite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926ÿ28 led to the killing of another 600,000 koalas during a one-month open season in August 1927.[158] In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state, suggesting that only 500ÿ1000 remained.[159]\\r\\nThe first successful efforts at conserving the species were initiated by the establishment of Brisbane's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Sydney's Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became the first to successfully breed koalas and earned a reputation as the foremost contemporary authority on the marsupial.[160] In 1934, David Fleay, curator of Australian mammals at the Melbourne Zoo, established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo, and featured the koala. This arrangement allowed him to undertake a detailed study of its diet in captivity. Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at Healesville Sanctuary and the David Fleay Wildlife Park.[161]\\r\\nSince 1870, koalas have been introduced to several coastal and offshore islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. Their numbers have significantly increased,[162] and since the islands are not large enough to sustain such high koala numbers, overbrowsing has become a problem.[163] In the 1920s, Lewis initiated a program of large-scale relocation and rehabilitation programs to transfer koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced to new regions, with the intent of eventually returning them to their former range. For example, in 1930ÿ31, 165 koalas were translocated to Quail Island. After a period of population growth, and subsequent overbrowsing of gum trees on the island, about 1,300 animals were released into mainland areas in 1944. The practice of translocating koalas became commonplace; Victorian State manager Peter Menkorst estimated that from 1923 to 2006, about 25,000 animals were translocated to more than 250 release sites across Victoria.[164] Since the 1990s, government agencies have tried to control their numbers by culling, but public and international outcry has forced the use of translocation and sterilisation, instead.[165]\\r\\nOne of the biggest anthropogenic threats to the koala is habitat destruction and fragmentation. In coastal areas, the main cause of this is urbanisation, while in rural areas, habitat is cleared for agriculture. Native forest trees are also taken down to be made into wood products.[166] In 2000, Australia ranked fifth in the world by deforestation rates, having cleared 564,800 hectares (1,396,000 acres).[167] The distribution of the koala has shrunk by more than 50% since European arrival, largely due to fragmentation of habitat in Queensland.[49] The koala's \\"vulnerable\\" status in Queensland and New South Wales means that developers in these states must consider the impacts on this species when making building applications.[152] In addition, koalas live in many protected areas.[1]\\r\\nWhile urbanisation can pose a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided enough trees are present.[168] Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities: collisions with vehicles and attacks by domestic dogs kill about 4,000 animals every year.[103] Injured koalas are often taken to wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres.[168] In a 30-year retrospective study performed at a New South Wales koala rehabilitation centre, trauma (usually resulting from a motor vehicle accident or dog attack) was found to be the most frequent cause of admission, followed by symptoms of Chlamydia infection.[169] Wildlife caretakers are issued special permits, but must release the animals back into the wild when they are either well enough or, in the case of joeys, old enough. As with most native animals, the koala cannot legally be kept as a pet in Australia or anywhere else.[170]","input":"How long does a baby koala stay with its mother?"},{"output":"Emperor Claudius","context":"The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD?43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: Britannia). Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54?BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.\\r\\nBetween 55?BC and the 40s?AD, the status quo of tribute, hostages, and client states without direct military occupation, begun by Caesar's invasions of Britain, largely remained intact. Augustus prepared invasions in 34?BC, 27?BC and 25?BC. The first and third were called off due to revolts elsewhere in the empire, the second because the Britons seemed ready to come to terms.[1] According to Augustus's Res Gestae, two British kings, Dubnovellaunus and Tincomarus, fled to Rome as suppliants during his reign,[2] and Strabo's Geography, written during this period, says Britain paid more in customs and duties than could be raised by taxation if the island were conquered.[3]\\r\\nBy the 40s?AD, the political situation within Britain was apparently in ferment. The Catuvellauni had displaced the Trinovantes as the most powerful kingdom in south-eastern Britain, taking over the former Trinovantian capital of Camulodunum (Colchester), and were pressing their neighbours the Atrebates, ruled by the descendants of Julius Caesar's former ally Commius.[4]\\r\\nCaligula planned a campaign against the Britons in 40, but its execution was bizarre: according to Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars, he drew up his troops in battle formation facing the English Channel and, once his forces had become quite confused, ordered them to gather seashells, referring to them as \\"plunder from the ocean due to the Capitol and the Palace\\".[5] Modern historians are unsure if that was meant to be an ironic punishment for the soldiers' mutiny or due to Caligula's derangement. Certainly this invasion attempt readied the troops and facilities that would make Claudius' invasion possible three years later. For example, Caligula built a lighthouse at Bononia (modern Boulogne-sur-Mer), the Tour D'Ordre, that provided a model for the one built soon after at Dubris (Dover).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 43, possibly by re-collecting Caligula's troops from 40, Claudius mounted an invasion force to re-instate Verica, an exiled king of the Atrebates.[6] Aulus Plautius, a distinguished senator, was given overall charge of four legions, totalling about 20,000 men, plus about the same number of auxiliaries. The legions were:\\r\\nThe II Augusta is known to have been commanded by the future emperor Vespasian. Three other men of appropriate rank to command legions are known from the sources to have been involved in the invasion. Cassius Dio mentions Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, who probably led the IX Hispana, and Vespasian's brother Titus Flavius Sabinus the Younger. He wrote that Sabinus was Vespasian's lieutenant, but as Sabinus was the older brother and preceded Vespasian into public life, he could hardly have been a military tribune. Eutropius mentions Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus, although as a former consul he may have been too senior, and perhaps accompanied Claudius later.[7]\\r\\nThe main invasion force under Aulus Plautius crossed in three divisions. The port of departure is usually taken to have been Boulogne (Latin: Bononia), and the main landing at Rutupiae (Richborough, on the east coast of Kent). Neither of these locations is certain. Dio does not mention the port of departure, and although Suetonius says that the secondary force under Claudius sailed from Boulogne,[8] it does not necessarily follow that the entire invasion force did. Richborough has a large natural harbour which would have been suitable, and archaeology shows Roman military occupation at about the right time. However, Dio says the Romans sailed east to west, and a journey from Boulogne to Richborough is south to north. Some historians[9] suggest a sailing from Boulogne to the Solent, landing in the vicinity of Noviomagus (Chichester) or Southampton, in territory formerly ruled by Verica. An alternative explanation might be a sailing from the mouth of the Rhine to Richborough, which would be east to west.[10]\\r\\nBritish resistance was led by Togodumnus and Caratacus, sons of the late king of the Catuvellauni, Cunobeline. A substantial British force met the Romans at a river crossing thought to be near Rochester on the River Medway. The battle raged for two days. Hosidius Geta was almost captured, but recovered and turned the battle so decisively that he was awarded the \\"Roman triumph\\".\\r\\nThe British were pushed back to the Thames. They were pursued by the Romans across the river causing some Roman losses in the marshes of Essex. Whether the Romans made use of an existing bridge for this purpose or built a temporary one is uncertain. At least one division of auxiliary Batavian troops swam across the river as a separate force.\\r\\nTogodumnus died shortly after the battle on the Thames. Plautius halted and sent word for Claudius to join him for the final push. Cassius Dio presents this as Plautius needing the emperor's assistance to defeat the resurgent British, who were determined to avenge Togodumnus. However, Claudius was no military man. Claudius's arch says he received the surrender of eleven kings without any loss,[11] and Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars says that Claudius received the surrender of the Britons without battle or bloodshed.[12] It is likely that the Catuvellauni were already as good as beaten, allowing the emperor to appear as conqueror on the final march on Camulodunum. Cassius Dio relates that he brought war elephants and heavy armaments which would have overawed any remaining native resistance. Eleven tribes of South East Britain surrendered to Claudius and the Romans prepared to move further west and north. The Romans established their new capital at Camulodunum and Claudius returned to Rome to celebrate his victory. Caratacus escaped and would continue the resistance further west.\\r\\nVespasian took a force westwards subduing tribes and capturing oppida as he went, going at least as far as Exeter, which would appear to have become an early base for Leg. II Augusta. [13] Legio IX Hispana was sent north towards Lincoln (Latin: Lindum Colonia) and within four years of the invasion it is likely that an area south of a line from the Humber to the Severn Estuary was under Roman control. That this line is followed by the Roman road of the Fosse Way has led many historians to debate the route's role as a convenient frontier during the early occupation. It is more likely that the border between Roman and Iron Age Britain was less direct and more mutable during this period.\\r\\nLate in 47 the new governor of Britain, Publius Ostorius Scapula, began a campaign against the tribes of modern-day Wales, and the Cheshire Gap. The Silures of southeast Wales caused considerable problems to Ostorius and fiercely defended the Welsh border country. Caratacus himself was defeated in the Battle of Caer Caradoc and fled to the Roman client tribe of the Brigantes who occupied the Pennines. Their queen, Cartimandua was unable or unwilling to protect him however given her own truce with the Romans and handed him over to the invaders. Ostorius died and was replaced by Aulus Didius Gallus who brought the Welsh borders under control but did not move further north or west, probably because Claudius was keen to avoid what he considered a difficult and drawn-out war for little material gain in the mountainous terrain of upland Britain. When Nero became emperor in 54, he seems to have decided to continue the invasion and appointed Quintus Veranius as governor, a man experienced in dealing with the troublesome hill tribes of Anatolia. Veranius and his successor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus mounted a successful campaign across Wales, famously destroying the druidical centre at Mona or Anglesey in 60 at what historians later called the Menai Massacre. Final occupation of Wales was postponed however when the rebellion of Boudica forced the Romans to return to the south east. The Silures were not finally conquered until circa 76 when Sextus Julius Frontinus' long campaign against them began to have success.\\r\\nFollowing the successful suppression of Boudica's uprising, a number of new Roman governors continued the conquest by edging north. Cartimandua was forced to ask for Roman aid following a rebellion by her husband Venutius. Quintus Petillius Cerialis took his legions from Lincoln as far as York and defeated Venutius near Stanwick around 70. This resulted in the already Romanised Brigantes and Parisii tribes being further assimilated into the empire proper. Frontinus was sent into Roman Britain in 74 to succeed Quintus Petillius Cerialis as governor of that island. He subdued the Silures and other hostile tribes of Wales, establishing a new base at Caerleon for Legio II Augusta (Isca Augusta) and a network of smaller forts fifteen to twenty kilometres apart for his auxiliary units. During his tenure, he probably established the fort at Pumsaint in west Wales, largely to exploit the gold deposits at Dolaucothi. He retired in 78, and later he was appointed water commissioner in Rome. The new governor was Gnaeus Julius Agricola, made famous through the highly laudatory biography of him written by his son-in-law, Tacitus.\\r\\nArriving in mid-summer of 78, Agricola found several previously defeated peoples had re-established their independence. The first to be dealt with were the Ordovices of north Wales, who had destroyed a cavalry ala of Roman auxiliaries stationed in their territory. Knowing the terrain from his prior military service in Britain, he was able to move quickly to defeat and virtually exterminate them. He then invaded Anglesey, forcing the inhabitants to sue for peace.[14] The following year he moved against the Brigantes of northern England and the Selgovae along the southern coast of Scotland, using overwhelming military power to re-establish Roman control.[15]\\r\\nDetails of the early years of the Roman occupation in North Britain are unclear but began no earlier than 71, as Tacitus says that in that year Petillius Cerialis (governor 71ÿ74) waged a successful war against the Brigantes,[16] whose territory straddled Britain along the Solway-Tyne line. Tacitus praises both Cerialis and his successor Julius Frontinus (governor 75ÿ78), but provides no additional information on events prior to 79 regarding the lands or peoples living north of the Brigantes. The Romans certainly would have followed up their initial victory over the Brigantes in some manner. In particular, archaeology has shown that the Romans had campaigned and built military camps in the north along Gask Ridge, controlling the glens that provided access to and from the Scottish Highlands, and also throughout the Scottish Lowlands in northeastern Scotland. In describing Agricola's campaigns, Tacitus does not explicitly state that this is actually a return to lands previously occupied by Rome, where Roman occupation either had been thrown off by the Brittonic inhabitants, or had been abandoned by the Romans.\\r\\nTacitus says that after a combination of force and diplomacy quieted discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the Firth of Tay (some historians hold that he stopped along the Firth of Forth in that year), not returning south until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the new lands that he had conquered, and in the rebellious lands that he had re-conquered.[17] In 82 he sailed to either Kintyre or the shores of Argyll, or to both. In 83 and 84 he moved north along Scotland's eastern and northern coasts using both land and naval forces, campaigning successfully against the inhabitants, and winning a significant victory over the northern British peoples led by Calgacus at the Battle of Mons Graupius.[18]\\r\\nPrior to his recall in 84, Agricola built a network of military roads and forts to secure the Roman occupation. Existing forts were strengthened and new ones planted in northeastern Scotland along the Highland Line, consolidating control of the glens that provided access to and from the Scottish Highlands. The line of military communication and supply along southeastern Scotland and northeastern England (i.e., Dere Street) was well-fortified. In southern-most Caledonia, the lands of the Selgovae (approximating to modern Dumfriesshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright) were heavily planted with forts, not only establishing effective control there, but also completing a military enclosure of south-central Scotland (most of the Southern Uplands, Teviotdale, and western Tweeddale).[19] In contrast to Roman actions against the Selgovae, the territories of the Novantae, Damnonii, and Votadini were not planted with forts, and there is nothing to indicate that the Romans were at war with them.\\r\\nAgricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian. His successors are not named in any surviving source, but it seems they were unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge in Perthshire, erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius, were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is equally likely that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was more profitable to leave the Caledonians alone and only under de jure submission.\\r\\nRoman occupation was withdrawn to a line subsequently established as one of the limites (singular limes) of the empire (i.e. a defensible frontier) by the construction of Hadrian's Wall. An attempt was made to push this line north to the River Clyde-River Forth area in 142 when the Antonine Wall was constructed. This was once again abandoned after two decades and only subsequently re-occupied on an occasional basis.\\r\\nThe Romans retreated to the earlier and stronger Hadrian's Wall in the River TyneSolway Firth frontier area, this having been constructed around 122. Roman troops, however, penetrated far into the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, there is a greater density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area.\\r\\nThe most notable was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae tribe, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy, a coalition of Brittonic Pictish[20] tribes of the north of Britain. He used the three legions of the British garrison (augmented by the recently formed 2nd Parthica legion), 9000 imperial guards with cavalry support, and numerous auxiliaries supplied from the sea by the British fleet, the Rhine fleet and two fleets transferred from the Danube for the purpose. According to Dio Cassius, he inflicted genocidal depredations on the natives and incurred the loss of 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics before having to withdraw to Hadrian's Wall. He repaired and reinforced the wall with a degree of thoroughness that led most subsequent Roman authors to attribute the construction of the wall to him. It was during the negotiations to purchase the truce necessary to secure the Roman retreat to the wall that the first recorded utterance, attributable with any reasonable degree of confidence, to a native of Scotland was made (as recorded by Dio Cassius). When Septimius Severus's wife, Julia Domna, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife of a Caledonian chief, Argentocoxos, replied: \\"We consort openly with the best of men while you allow yourselves to be debauched in private by the worst\\".[21] The emperor Septimius Severus died at York while planning to renew hostilities, and these plans were abandoned by his son Caracalla.\\r\\nLater excursions into Scotland by the Romans were generally limited to the scouting expeditions of exploratores in the buffer zone that developed between the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The degree to which the Romans interacted with the Gaelic speaking island of Hibernia (modern Ireland) is still unresolved amongst archaeologists in Ireland. The successes and failures of the Romans in subduing the peoples of Britain are still represented in the political geography of the British Isles today.[clarification needed]","input":"Who was the roman emperor who invaded britain?"},{"output":"Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr.","context":"World War II:\\r\\nPaul Warfield Tibbets Jr. (23 February 1915 ÿ 1 November 2007) was a brigadier general in the United States Air Force. He is best known as the pilot who flew the Enola Gay (named after his mother) when it dropped Little Boy, the first of two atomic bombs used in warfare, on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\\r\\nTibbets enlisted in the United States Army in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic. In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the 340th Bombardment Squadron of the 97th Bombardment Group, which was equipped with the Boeing B-17. In July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the Eighth Air Force, and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight heavy bomber mission against Occupied Europe on 17 August 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly Major General Mark W. Clark and Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the Twelfth Air Force.\\r\\nTibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the 509th Composite Group, which would conduct the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war, he participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the early 1950s. He commanded the 308th Bombardment Wing and 6th Air Division in the late 1950s, and was military attach in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for Executive Jet Aviation, serving on the founding board and as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by barnstormer Doug Davis, dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the Hialeah Park Race Track.[1][2]\\r\\nIn the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets's family to return to Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville,[1] and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934.[3] During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines.[3] After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.[1]\\r\\nBecause he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the Aviation Cadet Training Program.[4] On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and received his pilot rating in 1938 at Kelly Field in San Antonio.[1]\\r\\nAfter graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the 16th Observation Squadron, which was based at Lawson Field, Georgia, with a flight supporting the Infantry School at nearby Fort Benning.[1] It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a department store in Columbus, Georgia. The two quietly married in a Roman Catholic seminary in Holy Trinity, Alabama on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper.[5] They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from Huntingdon College and Auburn University. He was a colonel in the United States Army Reserves and worked as a hospital pharmacist. He died in West Monroe, Louisiana, in 2016.[6] The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in Georgiana in Butler County in southern Alabama.[7][8]\\r\\nWhile Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning, he was promoted to first lieutenant[9] and served as a personal pilot for Brigadier General George S. Patton, Jr., in 1940 and 1941.[1] In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the 9th Bombardment Squadron of the 3d Bombardment Group at Hunter Field, Savannah, Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the A-20 Havoc.[10] While there he was promoted to captain. In December 1941, he received orders to join the 29th Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, for training on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while listening to the radio during a routine flight.[9] Due to fears that German U-Boats might enter Tampa Bay and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah.[11] Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, with 21 B-18 Bolo medium bombers.[1] The B-18s were used as an intermediate trainer, which pilots flew after basic flight training in a Cessna UC-78 and before qualifying in the B-17.[12]\\r\\nIn February 1942, Tibbets reported for duty with the 29th Bombardment Group as its engineering officer. Three weeks later he was named the commanding officer of the 340th Bombardment Squadron of the 97th Bombardment Group, equipped with the B-17D.[13] It was initially based at MacDill, and then Sarasota Army Airfield, Florida, before moving to Godfrey Army Airfield in Bangor, Maine.[14]\\r\\nIn July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group of the Eighth Air Force to be deployed to England, where it was based at RAF Polebrook.[15] It had been hastily assembled to meet demands for an early deployment, and arrived without any training in the basics of high altitude daylight bombing. In the first weeks of August 1942, under the tutelage of Royal Air Force veterans, the group received intensive training for its first mission. The group commander, Lieutenant Colonel Cornelius W. Cousland,[16] was replaced by Colonel Frank A. Armstrong Jr., who appointed Tibbets as his deputy.[17]\\r\\nTibbets flew the lead bomber Butcher Shop[18] for the first American daylight heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow penetration raid against a marshalling yard in Rouen in Occupied France, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, Red Gremlin, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew with him in Enola Gay.[19] On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.[20][21]\\r\\nOn that first mission, Tibbets saw in real-time that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. At the time, he thought to himself, \\"People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. Those are not soldiers.\\" But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program and ended up in drug sales. The reason why they had failed the program was because \\"they had too much sympathy for their patients\\", which \\"destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities\\". It dawned on Tibbets that:\\r\\nI am just like that if I get to thinking about some innocent person getting hit on the ground. I am supposed to be a bomber pilot and destroy a target. I wont be worth anything if I do that... I made up my mind then that the morality of dropping that bomb was not my business. I was instructed to perform a military mission to drop the bomb. That was the thing that I was going to do the best of my ability. Morality, there is no such thing in warfare. I dont care whether you are dropping atom bombs, or 100-pound bombs, or shooting a rifle. You have got to leave the moral issue out of it.[22]\\r\\nIn the leadup to Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, the commander of the Eighth Air Force, Major General Carl Spaatz was ordered to provide his best two pilots for a secret mission. He chose Tibbets and Major Wayne Connors. Tibbets flew Major General Mark W. Clark from Polebrook to Gibraltar while Connors flew Clark's chief of staff, Brigadier General Lyman Lemnitzer.[23] A few weeks later Tibbets flew the Supreme Allied Commander, Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, there.[24] \\"By reputation\\", historian Stephen Ambrose wrote, Tibbets was \\"the best flier in the Army Air Force [sic].\\"[25]\\r\\nTibbets had flown 25 combat missions against targets in France[13] when the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to North Africa as part of Major General Jimmy Doolittle's Twelfth Air Force. For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He claimed that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions,[26] was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel Lauris Norstad, Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force.[13] Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to colonel, but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers. He was told that Norstad had vetoed the promotion, saying \\"there's only going to be one colonel in operations.\\"[27]\\r\\nTibbets did not get along well with Norstad, or with Doolittle's chief of staff, Brigadier General Hoyt Vandenberg. In one planning meeting, Norstad wanted an all-out raid on Bizerte to be flown at 6,000 feet (1,800?m). Tibbets protested that flak would be most effective at that altitude. When challenged by Norstad, Tibbets said he would lead the mission himself at 6,000 feet if Norstad would fly as his co-pilot. Norstad backed down, and the mission was successfully flown at 20,000 feet (6,100?m).[28]\\r\\nWhen General Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold, the Chief of United States Army Air Forces, requested an experienced bombardment pilot to help with the development of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, Doolittle recommended Tibbets.[29] Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943. At the time, the B-29 program was beset by a host of technical problems, and the chief test pilot, Edmund T. Allen, had been killed in a crash of the prototype aircraft.[30]\\r\\nWorking with the Boeing plant in Wichita, Kansas, Tibbets test-flew the B-29 and soon accumulated more flight time in it than any other pilot. He found that without defensive armament and armor plating, the aircraft was 7,000 pounds (3,200?kg) lighter, and its performance was much improved. In simulated combat engagements against a P-47 fighter at the B-29's cruising altitude of 30,000 feet (9,100?m), he discovered that the B-29 had a smaller turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.[31][32]\\r\\nAfter a year of developmental testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy), a B-29 training unit based at Grand Island Army Air Field, Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29.[13] Tibbets taught two Women Airforce Service Pilots, Dora Dougherty and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.[33]\\r\\nOn 1 September 1944, Tibbets reported to Colorado Springs Army Airfield, the headquarters of the Second Air Force, where he met with its commander, Major General Uzal Ent, and three representatives of the Manhattan Project, Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr., Captain William S. Parsons, and Norman F. Ramsey Jr., who briefed him on the project.[34] Tibbets was told that he would be in charge of the 509th Composite Group, a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of military stores. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: Great Bend Army Airfield, Kansas; Mountain Home Army Airfield, Idaho; or Wendover Army Air Field, Utah.[35] Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.[36]\\r\\nWhen the operation was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.[37]\\r\\nTibbets was promoted to colonel in January 1945[38] and brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover. He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. In order to disguise all the civilian engineers on base who were working on the Manhattan Project, Tibbets was forced to lie to his wife; he told her that the engineers were \\"sanitary workers.\\" At one point, Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to unplug a drain.[39]\\r\\nOn 6 March 1945 (concurrent with the activation of Project Alberta), the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at Los Alamos. Its purpose was to provide \\"skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers\\"[40] and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% rejection rate. The 509th Composite Group reached full strength in May 1945.[41]\\r\\nWith the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island:[42] the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee.[43]\\r\\nThe ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945, to its port of embarkation at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while the group's materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner.[44] An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between May 15 and 22,[45] where it was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945.[46] Project Alberta's \\"Destination Team\\" also sent most of its members to Tinian to supervise the assembly, loading, and dropping of the bombs under the administrative title of 1st Technical Services Detachment, Miscellaneous War Department Group.[47][48]\\r\\nOn 5 August 1945, Tibbets formally named his B-29 Enola Gay after his mother.[49] Enola Gay had been personally selected by him while it was still on the assembly line at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Bellevue, Nebraska.[50] The regularly assigned aircraft commander, Robert A. Lewis, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.[49][51]\\r\\nAt 02:45 the next dayin accordance with the terms of Operations Order No. 35the Enola Gay departed North Field for Hiroshima, Japan, with Tibbets at the controls. Tinian was approximately 2,000 miles (3,200?km) away from Japan, so it took six hours to reach Hiroshima. The atomic bomb, code-named \\"Little Boy\\", was dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets recalled that the city was covered with a tall mushroom cloud after the bomb was dropped.[52]\\r\\nTibbets was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by Spaatz immediately after landing on Tinian.[53] He became a celebrity, with pictures and interviews of his wife and children in the major American newspapers. He was seen as a national hero who had ended the war with Japan. Tibbets later received an invitation from President Harry S. Truman to visit the White House.[54] The 509th Composite Group was awarded an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1999.[55]\\r\\nTibbets was interviewed extensively by Mike Harden of the Columbus Dispatch, and profiles appeared in the newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: \\"I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did?... I sleep clearly every night.\\"[56][57] \\"I knew when I got the assignment,\\" he told a reporter in 2005, \\"it was going to be an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico.[59] Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group.[60] Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.[61]\\r\\nTibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon.[13] When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attach, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program.[62] He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted.[13]\\r\\nTibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France.[13] He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama,[63] and he and Lucy divorced that year.[64] During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956.[65] They had a son, James Tibbets.[66]\\r\\nIn January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida.[13] and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959.[67] This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System.[13] In 1964, Tibbets was named military attach in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966.[67] He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966.[68]\\r\\nAfter his retirement from the Air Force, Tibbets worked for Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), an air taxi company based in Columbus, Ohio, and now called NetJets. He was one of the founding board members and attempted to extend the company's operations to Europe, but was unsuccessful. He retired from the company in 1968, and returned to Miami, Florida, where he had spent part of his childhood. The banks foreclosed on EJA in 1970, and Bruce Sundlun became president. Sundlun lured Tibbets back to EJA that year. Tibbets succeeded Sundlun as president on 21 April 1976, and remained in the role until 1986. He served for a year as a consultant before his second and final retirement from EJA in 1987.[8][57][69]\\r\\nBarry Nelson played Tibbets in the film The Beginning or the End (1947).[70] Above and Beyond (1952) depicted the World War II events that involved Tibbets; Robert Taylor starred as Tibbets and Eleanor Parker played the role of his first wife Lucy.[71] Tibbets was also the model for screenwriter Sy Bartlett's fictional character \\"Major Joe Cobb\\" in the film Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and for a brief period in February 1949 was slated to be the film's technical advisor until his replacement at the last minute by Colonel John H. deRussy.[72] Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb, a 1980 made-for-television movie, somewhat fictionalized, told the story of Tibbets crew. Patrick Duffy played Tibbets and Kim Darby played Lucy.[73]\\r\\nIn other fictional portrayals, Nicholas Kilbertus was Tibbets in the film Day One (1989),[74] David Gow played him in the TV movie Hiroshima (1995),[75] and Ian Shaw played the part in the BBC's TV docudrama Hiroshima (2005), for which Tibbets was also interviewed on camera.[76] An interview with Tibbets also appeared in the movie Atomic Cafe (1982),[77] as well as was in the 1970s British documentary series The World at War,[78] and the \\"Men Who Brought the Dawn\\" episode of the Smithsonian Networks' War Stories (1995).[79] Tibbets figured largely in the 2000 book Duty: A Father, His Son and the Man Who Won the War by Bob Greene of the Chicago Tribune.[80]\\r\\nIn 1976, the United States government apologized to Japan after Tibbets re-enacted the bombingcomplete with a mushroom cloudin a restored B-29 at an air show in Texas. He said that he had not intended for the re-enactment to insult the Japanese people.[56][81] In 1995, he denounced the 50th anniversary exhibition of the Enola Gay at the Smithsonian Institution, which attempted to present the bombing in context with the destruction it caused, as a \\"damn big insult\\",[56] due to its focus on the Japanese casualties rather than the brutality of the Japanese government.[56] He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1996.[68]\\r\\nTibbets's grandson Paul W. Tibbets IV graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the 393d Bomb Squadron, flying the B-2 Spirit at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The squadron was one of the two operational squadrons that had formed part of the 509th Composite Group when Tibbets commanded it. Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America's strategic nuclear forces.[82] On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the 509th Bomb Wing.[83]\\r\\nTibbets died in his Columbus, Ohio, home on 1 November 2007, at the age of 92.[56][84] He had suffered small strokes and heart failure during his final years and had been in hospice care.[8][85] He was survived by his French-born wife, Andrea,[81] and two sons from his first marriage, Paul III and Gene as well as his son, James, from his second marriage.[8][85] Tibbets had asked for no funeral or headstone, because he feared that opponents of the bombing might use it as a place of protest or destruction. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated,[86] and his ashes were scattered over the English Channel;[87] he had flown over the Channel many times during the war.[85]\\r\\nSource: Ohio History Central.[88]","input":"Who was the pilot who dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima?"},{"output":"a key part of the Spanish Empire","context":"","input":"What was puerto rico before it was a commonwealth?"},{"output":"representative democracy","context":" \\r\\nGovernment of the Dominican Republic takes place in a framework of a representative democracy, whereby the President of the Dominican Republic is both head of state, head of government, and of a multi-party system.

After at least one constitutional term, a person who has held the post of President before may run for this Office again, according to the last amendment made to the Constitution in 2010. Elections are held in years evenly divisible by four.\\r\\nThe Dominican Constitution takes twenty-seven paragraphs to spell out the president's extensive powers. Among the most important are those that grant him authority over virtually all appointments and removals of public officials, and even popular elected ones; empower him to promulgate the laws passed by Congress; direct him to engage in diplomatic relations; and empower him to command, to deploy, and to make appointments in, the armed forces. The president also has vast emergency powers to suspend basic rights in times of emergency, to defer the legislature, to declare a state of siege, and to rule by decree.\\r\\nThe 1966 Constitution provides for ministers and subcabinet ministers to assist in public administration. These officials must be Dominican citizens, at least twenty-five years of age, with full civil and political rights. The powers of the ministers are determined by law. However, the president is constitutionally responsible for the actions of his ministers. Ministers serve at the president's discretion, and function both as administrators of their ministries and as agents of presidential authority.\\r\\nThe military consists of about 45,000 active duty personnel. Its principal mission is to defend the nation, but it serves more as an internal security force. The army, twice as large as the other services combined, consists of four infantry brigades and a combat support brigade; the air force operates three flying squadrons; and the navy maintains 30 aging vessels. The Dominican Republic's military is second in size to Cuba's in the Caribbean.\\r\\nThe armed forces participate fully in counter-narcotics efforts. They also are active in efforts to control contraband and illegal immigration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and from the Dominican Republic to the United States and Puerto Rico.\\r\\nLegislative power is exercised by a bicameral National Congress (Congreso de la Rep~blica). The upper house is the Senate (Senado) with 32 members, elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies. The lower house is the Chamber of Deputies (Cmara de Diputados) with 178 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in accordance to each province, as follows: one deputy is elected for every 50,000 inhabitants plus fraction exceeding 25,000, but never less than two.\\r\\nAmong the attributions of the Senate are the following:\\r\\nCongressional and municipal elections are held separately from the presidential elections. Re-election is always possible, without any limitation. The office of Senator and Deputy are incompatible with any other position or employment at the Public Administration.\\r\\nThe Judicial Power is charged of administering justice in order to ensure the respect, protection and supervision of rights recognized under the Constitution and laws. Its higher organ is the Supreme Court of Justice, which is composed of 16 judges appointed by the National Council of Magistrates, an entity created by the constitutional reform of 1994 to ensure the independence of the Judicial Branch.\\r\\nThe National Council of Magistrates is nominated by the three major political parties. It is presided by the President of the Republic and has the following members:\\r\\nThe Supreme Court hears appeals from lower courts (as a Court of Cassation) and chooses members of lower courts. It has sole jurisdiction over actions against the President, designated members of his cabinet, and members of Congress. It has administrative and financial autonomy.\\r\\nApart from working as an appeals court for all judgments rendered by judicial courts, the Supreme Court supervises all judges in the Dominican territory. Its judicial and administrative functions may be summarized as follows:\\r\\nEach of the 31 provinces is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. People-elected mayors and municipal councils administer the National District (Santo Domingo) and the 103 municipal districts.\\r\\nThe Dominican Republic has 31 provinces (provincias) and one National District* (Distrito Nacional): Azua, Baoruco, Barahona, Dajab܇n, Duarte, El Seibo, Elas Pi?a, Espaillat, Hato Mayor, Independencia, La Altagracia, La Romana, La Vega, Mara Trinidad Snchez, Monse?or Nouel, Monte Cristi, Monte Plata, Pedernales, Peravia, Puerto Plata, Hermanas Mirabal, Saman, Snchez Ramrez, San Crist܇bal, San Jos de Ocoa, San Juan, San Pedro de Macors, Santiago, Santiago Rodrguez, Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional, and Valverde.\\r\\nThe Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system with national elections every four years. In two rounds of presidential elections in 1996, nearly 80% of eligible Dominican voters went to the polls. The leading parties in 1994 were the PRSC, linked to the International Christian Democratic political movement, whose candidate was President Joaqun Balaguer; the PRD, affiliated with the Socialist International, whose candidate was Jos Francisco Pe?a G܇mez; and the PLD, whose candidate was former President Juan Bosch.\\r\\nIn the 1994 elections, international observers noted many irregularities in the voter lists, and the opposition PRD immediately charged the Central Electoral Board and the PRSC with fraud. A Verification Commission appointed by the Central Electoral Board, however, did not accept the PRD's charges. By all estimates, total disenfranchised voters far exceeded the 22,281-vote margin of victory in favor of President Balaguer on 2 August 1994.\\r\\nFollowing an intense period of political activity, the competing political parties signed a Pact for Democracy on 10 August, reducing President Balaguer's term of office from 4 to 2 years, setting early elections, and reforming the constitution. A new Central Electoral Board was named to work on electoral reform. The main candidates in 1996 were Vice President Jacinto Peynado (PRSC), Jos Francisco Pe?a G܇mez (PRD), and Leonel Fernndez (PLD).\\r\\nDomestic and international observers saw the 1996 election as transparent and fair. After the first round in which Jacinto Peynado (PRSC) was eliminated, the PRSC with Joaqun Balaguer endorsed Leonel Fernndez (PLD). Results in the second round, 45 days later on 30 June, were tabulated quickly, and although the victory margin was narrow (1.5%), it was never questioned. The transition from incumbent administration to incoming administration was smooth and ushered in a new, modern era in Dominican political life.\\r\\nFernndez' political agenda was one of economic and judicial reform. He helped enhance Dominican participation in hemispheric affairs, such as the Organization of American States and the follow-up to the Miami Summit. On 16 May 2000, Hip܇lito Meja, the Revolutionary Democratic Party candidate, was elected president in another free and fair election. He defeated Dominican Liberation Party candidate Danilo Medina 49.8% to 24.84%. Former President Balaguer garnered 24.68% of the vote. Mejia entered office on 16 August with four priorities: education reform, economic development, increased agricultural production, and poverty alleviation. Meja also champions the cause of Central American and Caribbean economic integration and migration, particularly as it relates to Haiti. On 16 May 2004, Leonel Fernndez, running for the Dominican Liberation Party, garnered about 57% of the vote. On 16 May 2008, Leonel Fernndez, running for the Dominican Liberation Party, garnered about 54% of the vote for a second consecutive term in office.\\r\\nPresidential elections are held in the Dominican Republic every four years, on the 16 May. The candidate must gain a majority vote of at least 50% plus one to win the presidency in the first round. If none of the candidates obtains such majority, a second poll will take place 45 days later, at which the population will decide between the two candidates that had the best results during the first poll.\\r\\nTemplate:Dominican Republic presidential election, 2016","input":"What form of government does the dominican republic have?"},{"output":"Minnesota","context":"Kiester is a city in Faribault County, Minnesota, United States.

Situated in the valley between the Aventine and Palatine Hills, it was the first and largest stadium in ancient Rome and its later Empire. It measured 621?m (2,037?ft) in length and 118?m (387?ft) in width and could accommodate over 150,000 spectators.[1] In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a public park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Circus was Rome's largest venue for ludi, public games connected to Roman religious festivals. Ludi were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the Roman people (populus Romanus) and gods. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the Roman calendar. Others might be given to fulfill a religious vow, such as the games in celebration of a triumph. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ludi at the Circus were vowed by Tarquin the Proud to Jupiter in the late Regal era for his victory over Pometia.[2]\\r\\nLudi ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, plays and recitals, beast-hunts and gladiator fights. Some included public executions. The greater ludi at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade (pompa circensis), much like the triumphal procession, which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.[3]\\r\\nDuring Rome's Republican era, the aediles organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ludi offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for higher office.[4] Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \\"flute players, scenic artists and dancers\\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A venatio held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \\"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.[5]\\r\\nAs Rome's provinces expanded, existing ludi were embellished and new ludi invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the late Republic, ludi were held on 57 days of the year;[6] an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby cattle market, just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of Catullus (mid-1st century BC) was likely \\"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\\"[7] frequented by \\"prostitutes, jugglers, fortune tellers and low-class performing artists.\\"[8]\\r\\nRome's emperors met the ever-burgeoning popular demand for regular ludi and the need for more specialised venues, as essential obligations of their office and cult. Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the Colosseum had been built to host most of the city's gladiator shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed Stadium of Domitian, though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.[10] Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ludi.[11]\\r\\nEven at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale venationes;[12] in the late 3rd century, the emperor Probus laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.[13] With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ludi gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast-hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and the last known races there were held by Totila in 549.[14]\\r\\nThe Circus Maximus was sited on the level ground of the Valley of Murcia (Vallis Murcia), between Rome's Aventine and Palatine Hills. In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river Tiber and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \\"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\\".[15]\\r\\nIn Livy's history of Rome, the first Etruscan king of Rome Lucius Tarquinius Priscus built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the equites and patricians), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, Tarquinius Superbus, added the first seating for citizen-commoners (plebs, or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.[16] Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained[17] but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (metae), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.[18]\\r\\nThe games' sponsor (Latin editor) usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (pulvinar) but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the Republican era) the dictator Manius Valerius Maximus and his descendants were granted rights to a curule chair at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.[19] In the 190s?BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.[20]\\r\\nPermanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted,[21] and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( Quadrigas ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,[22] they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by herms that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, four-horse or two-horse chariots could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.[23] Typically, there were seven laps per race. From at least 174?BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs; Castor and Pollux, who were born from an egg, were divine patrons of horses, horsemen, and the equestrian order (equites). In 33?BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier (euripus) for maximum visibility.[24][25]\\r\\nJulius Caesar's development of the Circus, commencing around 50?BC, extended the seating tiers to run almost the entire circuit of the track, barring the starting gates and a processional entrance at the semi-circular end.[26] The track measured approximately 621?m (2,037?ft) in length and 150?m (387?ft) in breadth. A?canal was cut between the track perimeter and its seating to protect spectators and help drain the track.[27] The inner third of the seating formed a trackside cavea. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for equites. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000; Pliny the Elder's estimate of 250,000 is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31?BC, either during or after construction.[28]\\r\\nThe fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and pulvinar at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.[30] Augustus had it brought from Heliopolis at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The pulvinar was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (aedes) raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus as \\"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\\", with \\"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\\"[31]\\r\\nThe site remained prone to flooding,[32] probably through the starting gates, until Claudius made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor Tiberius compensated various small businesses there for their losses.[33] In AD 64, during Nero's reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.[34]\\r\\nBy the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.[35]\\r\\nIn AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring Titus at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.[36] The emperor Domitian built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.[37]\\r\\nThe risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted Trajan's decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside her gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under Caracalla, and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in Diocletian's reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.[38]\\r\\nThe southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess Murcia, an obscure deity associated with Venus, the myrtle shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.[39] The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to Consus, a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess Ceres and to the underworld. According to Roman tradition, Romulus discovered this shrine shortly after the founding of Rome. He invented the Consualia festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then abducted the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous Roman myth of the Rape of the Sabine women had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.\\r\\nIn this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and Hercules' Ara Maxima, supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.[40] In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus's patron deities, was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the spina or euripus)[41] between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as Vallis Murcia.[42]\\r\\nTemples to several other deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to Ceres and Flora stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to Luna, the moon goddess. Aventine temples to Venus Obsequens, Mercury and Dis (or perhaps Summanus) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to Magna Mater and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god Apollo.\\r\\nSun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of Stoic and solar monism as a theological basis for the Roman Imperial cult. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred obelisk towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line. The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (quadriga) through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (biga); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.[43] In Imperial cosmology, the emperor was Sol-Apollo's earthly equivalent, and Luna may have been linked to the empress.[citation needed] Luna's temple, built long before Apollo's, burned down in the Great Fire of 64 AD and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of Diana, who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with Sol Indiges, usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.[44]\\r\\nSeveral festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the Cerealia, the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \\"Roman Games\\" (Ludi Romani) held at the Circus in honour of Jupiter in 366 BC.[45] In the early Imperial era, Ovid describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,[46] followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.[47] Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.\\r\\nAfter the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried 6m beneath the modern surface. In the 11th century, the Circus was \\"replaced by dwellings rented out by the congregation of Saint-Guy.\\"[48] In the 12th century, a watercourse was dug there to drain the soil, and by the 1500s the area was used as a market garden.[49] Many of the Circus' standing structures survived these changes; in 1587, two obelisks were removed from the central barrier by Pope Sixtus V, and one of these was re-sited at the Piazza del Popolo. Mid 19th century workings at the circus site uncovered the lower parts of a seating tier and outer portico. Since then, a series of excavations has exposed further sections of the seating, curved turn and central barrier but further exploration has been limited by the scale, depth and waterlogging of the site.[50]\\r\\nThe Circus site now functions as a large park area, in the centre of the city. It is often used for concerts and meetings. The Rome concert of Live 8 (July 2, 2005) was held there. The English band Genesis performed a concert before an estimated audience of 500,000 people in 2007 (this was filmed and released as When in Rome 2007). The Rolling Stones played there in front of 71,527 people on June 22, 2014 for the Italian date of their 14 On Fire tour. The Circus has also hosted victory celebrations, following the Italian World Cup 2006 victory and the A.S. Roma Serie A victory in 2001.\\r\\n Media related to Circus Maximus at Wikimedia Commons\\r\\nCoordinates: 415309N 122909E? / ?41.8859N 12.4857E? / 41.8859; 12.4857","input":"How many spectators could the circus maximus hold?"},{"output":"June 26, 1950","context":"\\"La Vie en rose\\" (French pronunciation:??[la vi ? ?oz]) was the signature song of popular French singer dith Piaf, written in 1945,[2] popularized in 1946, and released as a single in 1947.

In 1943, Piaf had performed at a nightclub/bordello called \\"La Vie en Rose\\".[8] Initially, Piaf's peers and songwriting team did not think the song would be successful, finding it weaker than the rest of her repertoire. Heeding their advice, the singer put the song aside, only to change her mind the next year. The song was performed live in concert for the first time in 1946. It became a favorite with audiences.[7] \\"La Vie en rose\\" was the song that made Piaf internationally famous, with its lyrics telling about the joy of finding true love and appealing to those who had survived the difficult wartime.[9]\\r\\n\\"La Vie en rose\\" was released on a 10\\" single in 1947 by Columbia Records, a division of EMI, with \\"Un refrain courait dans la rue\\" making the B-side.

The first of her albums to include \\"La Vie en rose\\" was the 10\\" Chansons parisiennes, released in 1950. The song appeared on most of Piaf's subsequent albums, and on numerous greatest hits compilations. It went on to become her signature song and her trademark hit, sitting with \\"Milord\\" and \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" among her best-known and most recognizable tunes. Encouraged by its success, Piaf wrote 80 more songs in her career.[7]\\r\\nEnglish lyrics were written by Mack David and numerous versions were recorded in the US in 1950.

Louis Armstrong recorded C'est si bon and La Vie en rose in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra on June 26, 1950[12] and this reached the No. 28 position in the Billboard charts.[13] Bing Crosby also recorded the song in French in 1953 for his album Le Bing: Song Hits of Paris.\\r\\nThe song received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998.[14]\\r\\nTwo films about Piaf named after the song's title have been produced. The first one, a 1998 documentary, used archive footage and interviews with Raquel Bitton, and was narrated by Bebe Neuwirth. The 2007 biographical feature film La Vie en Rose won Marion Cotillard an Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying Piaf in the film from childhood until her death at 47.[15]\\r\\nJamaican singer Grace Jones covered \\"La Vie en rose\\" in 1977 for her debut studio album Portfolio. It was the third and the last single off that album, and at the same time, her first single release on Island Records after having signed with the label.\\r\\nThe single version was heavily edited from its original album version being more than seven minutes long to a 3.5-minute track. Jones' fairly radical bossa nova interpretation of dith Piaf's signature tune became her first international hit single and a staple of her repertoire. It was later performed as part of her 1981 A One Man Show, then the only track from her disco era to be included in the show. In Spain and Mexico the track was billed as \\"La Vida en rosa\\" on the 7\\" single release, although it was not a Spanish version of the song. Jones' recording of \\"La Vie en rose\\" was later re-released a number of times in the early 1980s and finally reached #12 in the UK charts when re-released as a double A-side with \\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\" in 1985. The single was certified Gold in France and Italy.[19]\\r\\nGrace Jones about the song: \\"That's a very special song to me. Oh God, I cry every time I sing it. I had quite a few French lovers, so every time I sing it I think about them.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe music video for the song was made using the chroma key technique. It presents Grace dancing and singing the song with the famous 1978 montage picture of herself in the background, which was later used for the cover of her 1985 Island Life compilation. The video begins with Grace wearing a rose-patterned coat. Having removed it, the singer dances in a scant gold dress which reveals her right nipple as well as black underwear.\\r\\nAmerican singer Donna Summer covered \\"La Vie en rose\\" in 1993 for the tribute album called Tribute to Edith Piaf or Edith Piaf Tribute, on which several contemporary stars recorded interpretations of some of Piaf's best known songs. Released on both vinyl and CD, the American release of the album and single contain a different mix of Summer's synth-driven performance than the French release. These releases are among the most sought after of Summer's collectables.[citation needed] The U.S. single features a variety of remixes by DJ Chris Cox.","input":"When did louis armstrong sing la vie en rose?"},{"output":"a set of standard terminology and guidelines (a body of knowledge) for project management","context":"The Project Management Body of Knowledge is a set of standard terminology and guidelines (a body of knowledge) for project management. The body of knowledge evolves over time and is presented in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (the Guide to the PMBOK or the Guide), a book whose sixth edition was released in 2017. The Guide is a document resulting from work overseen by the Project Management Institute (PMI), which offers the CAPM and PMP certifications.\\r\\nMuch of the PMBOK Guide is unique to project management e.g. critical path method and work breakdown structure (WBS).

The Fifth Edition was released in 2013.\\r\\nThe latest English-language version of The PMBOK Guide  The Sixth Edition was released in September 2017.[3]\\r\\nThe PMBOK Guide is intended to be a \\"subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as a good practice. 'Generally recognized' means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time and there is a consensus about their value and usefulness. 'Good practice' means there is a general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques can enhance the chance of success over many projects.\\"[4] This means that sometimes the \\"latest\\" project management trends, often promoted by consultants, may not be part of the latest version of The PMBOK Guide.\\r\\nHowever, the 6th Edition of the PMBOK Guide now includes an \\"Agile Practice Guide\\"\\r\\nThe PMBOK Guide is process-based, meaning it describes work as being accomplished by processes. This approach is consistent with other management standards such as ISO 9000 and the Software Engineering Institute's CMMI. Processes overlap and interact throughout a project or its various phases.\\r\\nA Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge  Sixth Edition provides guidelines for managing individual projects and defines project management related concepts. It also describes the project management life cycle and its related processes, as well as the project life cycle.[4] and for the first time it includes an \\"Agile Practice Guide\\".\\r\\nThe PMBOK as described in the Guide recognizes 47 processes that fall into five basic process groups and ten knowledge areas that are typical of most projects, most of the time.\\r\\nThe five process groups are:\\r\\nThe ten knowledge areas, each of which contains some or all of the project management processes, are:\\r\\nEach of the ten knowledge areas contains the processes that need to be accomplished within its discipline in order to achieve effective project management. Each of these processes also falls into one of the five process groups, creating a matrix structure such that every process can be related to one knowledge area and one process group.\\r\\nWhile the PMBOK Guide is meant to offer a general guide to manage most projects most of the time, there are currently three official extensions:\\r\\nThe PMBOK is a widely accepted standard in project management, however there are alternatives to the PMBOK standard, and PMBOK does have its critics. One thrust of critique has come from the critical chain developers and followers (e.g. Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Lawrence P. Leach),[5] as opposed to critical path method adherents. The PMBOK Guide section on Project Time Management does indicate Critical Chain as an alternative method to Critical Path.\\r\\nA second strand of criticism originates in Lean Construction. This approach emphasises the lack of two way communication in the PMBOK model and offers and alternative which emphasises a language/action perspective and continual improvement in the planning process.[6]","input":"What is project management body of knowledge (pmbok)?"},{"output":"Buckeyes won 26ÿ17.","context":"Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Heather Cox and Tom Rinaldi (ESPN)\\r\\nEduardo Varela and Pablo Viruega (ESPN Deportes)\\r\\nThe 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship was a bowl game that determined the consensus national champion of NCAA Division I FBS college football for the 2014 season, which took place at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on January 12, 2015.

It is also used in Northern Ireland, alongside British Sign Language (BSL). Irish Sign Language is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF) than to BSL, though it has influence from both languages. It has influenced sign languages in Australia and South Africa, and has little relation to either spoken Irish or English.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish Deaf Society says that ISL \\"arose from within deaf communities\\", \\"was developed by deaf people themselves\\" and \\"has been in existence for hundreds of years\\". According to Ethnologue, the language has influence from both LSF and BSL, as well as from signed French and signed English, BSL having been introduced in Dublin in 1816.[3] The first school for deaf children in Ireland was established in 1816 by Dr. Charles Orpen. The Claremont Institute was a Protestant institution and given that Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom, it is no surprise that BSL (or some version of signed English based in BSL) was used for teaching and learning (Pollard 2006). McDonnell (1979) reports that the Irish institutions - Catholic and Protestant - did not teach the children to speak and it was not until 1887 that Claremont report changing from a manual to an oral approach. For the Catholic schools, the shift to oralism came later: St. Mary's School for Deaf Girls moved to an oral approach in 1946 and St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys shifted to oralism in 1956,[4] though this did not become formal state policy until 1972. Sign language use was seriously suppressed and religion was used to further stigmatise the language (e.g. children were encouraged to give up signing for Lent and sent to confession if caught signing).[5] The fact that the Catholic schools are segregated on the basis of gender led to the development of a gendered-generational variant of Irish Sign Language that is still evident (albeit to a lesser degree) today.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nISL was brought by Catholic missionaries to Australia,and to Scotland and England, with remnants of ISL still visible in some variants of BSL, especially in Glasgow, and with some elderly Auslan Catholics still using ISL today. In South Africa, the Dominican nuns who established Catholic Schools saw a need for a school for the deaf, but due to resource constraints were not in a position to do this immediately. Instead, they wrote back to their Mother House in Cabra requesting an experienced teacher of the deaf. A deaf teacher, Ms. Bridget Lynne, responded. Remnants of gendered generational Irish Sign Language are thought to still be visible in some dialects of South African Sign Language[7], which can probably be traced back to Ms. Lynne. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016\\" passed all stages in the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) on 14 December 2017, and was signed into law by the President of Ireland Michael D Higgins on 24 December 2017.[8][9] The Bill  ensures that public services are available through ISL and also outlines the need for greater access to education through sign language. Prior to the passage, there was no automatic right for deaf people to have an ISL interpreter (except for criminal court proceedings). For the deaf community, recognition of ISL means more legal rights and better access to public services - including education, healthcare, media and banking.[10][11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ISO 639-3 code for Irish Sign Language is 'isg'; 'isl' is the code for Icelandic.","input":"What type of sign language is used in ireland?"},{"output":"3 September 1939","context":"The Declaration of war by France and the United Kingdom was given on 3 September 1939, after German forces invaded Poland.

Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that I could have done and that would have been more successful.\\r\\nUp to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland, but Hitler would not have it.\\r\\nHe had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened; and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement.\\r\\nThe proposals were never shown to the Poles nor to us; and though they were announced in a German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them, but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning.\\r\\nHis action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace. The situation in which no word given by Germanys ruler could be trusted and no people or country could feel itself safe has become intolerable.\\r\\nAnd now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your part with calmness and courage.\\r\\nAt such a moment as this the assurances of support that we have received from the Empire are a source of profound encouragement to us.\\r\\nWhen I have finished speaking certain detailed announcements will be made on behalf of the Government.

It is the evil things that we shall be fighting against ÿ brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression and persecution ÿ and against them I am certain that the right will prevail.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the First World War, the German Empire signed the First Armistice at Compigne on 11 November 1918 as an end to hostilities with France, the British Empire, and the United States during the convoluted German Revolution of 1918ÿ19, which began 29 October 1918.\\r\\nNegotiations between the Allied powers regarding post-war Europe started on 18 January 1919 in the Salle de l'Horloge at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Seventy delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. The opposing nations of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were excluded from the negotiations. At first a \\"Council of Ten\\" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan met officially to decide the peace terms. It became the \\"Big Four\\" when Japan dropped out and the top person from each of the other four nations met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions to be ratified by the entire assembly. In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including articles 227, 230 and 231. In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June 1919, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.\\r\\nOn 28 June 1919, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, a peace treaty which ended the formal state of war and imposed various punitive measures upon Germany, including military restriction, loss of territory and colonies, war debt, and effective acceptance of blame for the initiation of hostilities in World War I. At the time of the armistice, an attempted Communist revolution transpired (October 1918-August 1919), resulting in the abdication of the Emperor of Germany in November 1918, and what became known as the Weimar Republic was subsequently established in the wake of the uprising. The transition from monarchy to republic was difficult, and many in the new government were not supportive of the democratic system of government. The officer class gave little support to the Republic, and Germany was forced to borrow money from the United States and others to pay its war debt, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. In the early 1920s a period of hyperinflation made the Reichsmark almost worthless. In January 1922, one US dollar was worth 191 Marks, but by November of the same year it was equal to 4,200,000,000 Marks.[2]\\r\\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich following a contentious election. Under Hitler's leadership, the Reichstag turned the government into an effective dictatorship under Hitler's oversight on 21 March 1933 with the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933, and the economic hardships were significantly diminished via implementation of new economic and social policies. After five years in power, Hitler annexed Austria, former component of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (allies of the former German Empire), into Germany, despite such an act (specifically, \\"prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations\\") being banned by both the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Versailles. In early November 1938, the First Vienna Award was signed, allowing Germany to seize the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia which had been a part of the German Empire-allied Austro-Hungarian Empire. Soon after, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia and also gained Memelland (part of the former German Empire from 1871-1920) through the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania.\\r\\nWhile some sources claim Hitler still wanted more, to create Lebensraum, or \\"living space\\", for Germany, other sources claim evidence of hostility on behalf of Polish partisans toward ethnic Germans in the Danzig Corridor (territory lost to Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles) which may have served as a motivating factor for the German invasion (often portrayed as propaganda to justify German expansionism).\\r\\nTwo Western powers, the United Kingdom and France, gave guarantees to Poland that they would declare war if Polish independence came under threat, as presented in a statement to the House of Commons by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 31 March 1939 (formalized by the British 6 April 1939; not ratified until 4 September 1939 by the French):\\r\\n... in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect.\\r\\nI may add that the French Government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty's Government.[3]\\r\\nAlthough they honoured these guarantees by declaring war soon after Germany's Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939,[4] and although the dominions of the British Empire quickly followed suit, so little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was soon defeated, that in its early stages the war declared by Britain and France was described as a \\"Phoney War\\".\\r\\nFurther, neither the British Empire, nor the French, ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939 (17 days after Nazi Germany invaded from the West) and held sway over the former-Polish territory at the war's conclusion, having become a part of the Allied front in the course of World War II. At the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the post-war Yalta Conference in 1945 sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London.\\r\\nThe following excerpts of the speech were sampled by the drum and bass artist S.P.Y. in his remix of Black Sun Empire's track \\"Potemkin\\":[5]\\r\\n- \\"that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us\\"\\r\\n- \\"I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany\\",","input":"When did great britain declare war on germany ww2?"},{"output":"Ledge Point, Western Australia","context":"The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The great white shark is notable for its size, with larger female individuals growing to 6.1?m (20?ft) in length and 1,950?kg (4,300?lb) in weight at maturity.[3][4][5] However most are smaller, males measuring 3.4 to 4.0?m (11 to 13?ft) and females 4.6 to 4.9?m (15 to 16?ft) on average.[5][6] According to a 2014 study the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates,[7] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known.[8] According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.[9] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56?km/h (35?mph),[10] and can swim to depths of 1,200?m (3,900?ft).[11]\\r\\nThe great white shark has no known natural predators other than, on very rare occasion, the killer whale.[12] The great white shark is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans.[13][14] The IUCN list the great white shark as a vulnerable species,[2] while it is included in Appendix?II of CITES.[15]\\r\\nThe novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and the subsequent film by Steven Spielberg depicted the great white shark as a \\"ferocious man eater\\". Humans are not the preferred prey of the great white shark,[16] but, nevertheless, the great white is responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great white shark was one of the many amphibia originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae,[18] its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its generic name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current scientific name, Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or jagged, and odous, which means tooth.[19]\\r\\nThe great white shark came into existence during the mid-Miocene epoch. The earliest known fossils of the great white shark are about 16 million years old.[1] However, the phylogeny of the great white is still in dispute. The original hypothesis for the great white's origins is that it shares a common ancestor with a prehistoric shark, such as the C.?megalodon. C. megalodon had teeth that were superficially not too dissimilar with those of great white sharks, but its teeth were far larger. Although cartilaginous skeletons do not fossilize, C. megalodon is estimated to have been considerably larger than the great white shark, estimated at up to 17?m (56?ft) and 59,413?kg (130,983?lb).[20] Similarities among the physical remains and the extreme size of both the great white and C.?megalodon led many scientists to believe these sharks were closely related, and the name Carcharodon megalodon was applied to the latter. However, a new hypothesis proposes that the C.?megalodon and the great white are distant relatives (albeit sharing the family Lamnidae). The great white is also more closely related to an ancient mako shark, Isurus hastalis, than to the C.?megalodon, a theory that seems to be supported with the discovery of a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae of the extinct transitional species Carcharodon hubbelli in 1988 and published on 14 November 2012.[21] In addition, the new hypothesis assigns C.?megalodon to the genus Carcharocles, which also comprises the other megatoothed sharks; Otodus obliquus is the ancient representative of the extinct Carcharocles lineage.[22]\\r\\nGreat white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between 12 and 24?C (54 and 75?F), with greater concentrations in the United States (Northeast and California), South Africa, Japan, Oceania, Chile, and the Mediterranean including Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus.[23][24] One of the densest known populations is found around Dyer Island, South Africa.[25]\\r\\nThe great white is an epipelagic fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game, such as fur seals (Arctocephalus ssp.), sea lions, cetaceans, other sharks, and large bony fish species. In the open ocean, it has been recorded at depths as great as 1,200?m (3,900?ft).[11] These findings challenge the traditional notion that the great white is a coastal species.[11]\\r\\nAccording to a recent study, California great whites have migrated to an area between Baja California Peninsula and Hawaii known as the White Shark Caf to spend at least 100 days before migrating back to Baja. On the journey out, they swim slowly and dive down to around 900?m (3,000?ft). After they arrive, they change behavior and do short dives to about 300?m (1,000?ft) for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that was tagged off of the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year. A similar study tracked a different great white shark from South Africa swimming to Australia's northwestern coast and back, a journey of 20,000?km (12,000?mi; 11,000?nmi) in under nine months.[26] These observations argue against traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, and open up the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously thought to have been discrete. The reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include seasonal feeding or mating.[27]\\r\\nThe great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are approximately the same size which is similar to some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.[28]\\r\\nIn great white sharks, sexual dimorphism is present, and females are generally larger than males. Male great whites on average measure 3.4 to 4.0?m (11 to 13?ft) long, while females at 4.6 to 4.9?m (15 to 16?ft).[6] Adults of this species weigh 522ÿ771?kg (1,151ÿ1,700?lb) on average,[30] however mature females can have an average mass of 680ÿ1,110?kg (1,500ÿ2,450?lb).[5] The largest females have been verified up to 6.1?m (20?ft) in length and an estimated 1,950?kg (4,300?lb) in weight,[3][4][5] perhaps up to 2,268?kg (5,000?lb).[31] The maximum size is subject to debate because some reports are rough estimations or speculations performed under questionable circumstances.[32] Among living cartilaginous fish, only the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) and the giant manta ray (Manta birostris), in that order, average larger and heavier. These three species are generally quite docile in disposition and given to passively filter-feeding on very small organisms.[30] This makes the great white shark the largest extant macropredatory fish. Great white sharks are at around 1.2?m (3.9?ft) when born, and grow about 25?cm (9.8?in) each year.[33]\\r\\nAccording to J.?E. Randall, the largest white shark reliably measured was a 5.94?m (19.5?ft) individual reported from Ledge Point, Western Australia in 1987.[34] Another great white specimen of similar size has been verified by the Canadian Shark Research Center: A female caught by David McKendrick of Alberton, Prince Edward Island, in August 1988 in the Gulf of St.?Lawrence off Prince Edward Island. This female great white was 6.1?m (20?ft) long.[5] However, there was a report considered reliable by some experts in the past, of a larger great white shark specimen from Cuba in 1945.[35][36][37][38] This specimen was 6.4?m (21?ft) long and had a body mass estimated at 3,324?kg (7,328?lb).[35][37] However, later studies also revealed that this particular specimen was actually around 4.9?m (16?ft) in length, a specimen in the average maximum size range.[5]\\r\\nThe largest great white recognized by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) is one caught by Alf Dean in the south Australian waters in 1959, weighing 1,208?kg (2,663?lb).[32] Several larger great whites caught by anglers have since been verified, but were later disallowed from formal recognition by IGFA monitors for rules violations.\\r\\nA number of very large unconfirmed great white shark specimens have been recorded.[39] For decades, many ichthyological works, as well as the Guinness Book of World Records, listed two great white sharks as the largest individuals: In the 1870s, a 10.9?m (36?ft) great white captured in southern Australian waters, near Port Fairy, and an 11.3?m (37?ft) shark trapped in a herring weir in New Brunswick, Canada, in the 1930s. However these measurements are not scientific and researchers have questioned the reliability of these measurements for a long time, noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. Later studies proved these theories correct. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified basking shark, as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J.?E. Randall examined the shark's jaws and \\"found that the Port Fairy shark was of the order of 5?m (17?ft) in length and suggested that a mistake had been made in the original record, in 1870, of the shark's length\\".[34] These wrong measurements would make the alleged shark more than five times heavier than it really was.\\r\\nSeveral unconfirmed reports of great white sharks caught in modern times with have been estimated to be more than 7?m (23?ft) long,[40] but these claims have received some criticism.[32][40] However, J.?E. Randall believed that great white shark may have exceeded 6.1?m (20?ft) in length.[34] A great white shark was captured near Kangaroo Island in Australia on 1 April 1987. This shark was estimated to be more than 6.9?m (23?ft) long by Peter Resiley,[34][41] and has been designated as KANGA.[40] Another great white shark was caught in Malta by Alfredo Cutajar on 16 April 1987. This shark was also estimated to be around 7.13?m (23.4?ft) long by John Abela and has been designated as MALTA.[40] However, Cappo drew criticism because he used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.?E. Randall to suggest that the KANGA specimen was 5.8ÿ6.4?m (19ÿ21?ft) long.[40] In a similar fashion, I.?K. Fergusson also used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.?E. Randall to suggest that the MALTA specimen was 5.3ÿ5.7?m (17ÿ19?ft) long.[40] However, photographic evidence suggested that these specimens were larger than the size estimations yielded through Randall's methods.[40] Thus, a team of scientistsH.?F. Mollet, G.?M. Cailliet, A.?P. Klimley, D.?A. Ebert, A.?D. Testi, and L.?J.?V. Compagnoreviewed the cases of the KANGA and MALTA specimens in 1996 to resolve the dispute by conducting a comprehensive morphometric analysis of the remains of these sharks and re-examination of photographic evidence in an attempt to validate the original size estimations and their findings were consistent with them. The findings indicated that estimations by P.?Resiley and J.?Abela are reasonable and could not be ruled out.[40] A particularly large female great white nicknamed \\"Deep Blue\\", estimated measuring at 6.1?m (20?ft) was filmed off Guadalupe during shooting for the 2014 episode of Shark Week \\"Jaws Strikes Back\\". Deep Blue would also later gain significant attention when she was filmed interacting with researcher Mauricio Hoyas Pallida in a viral video that Mauricio posted on Facebook on 11 June 2015.[42] A particularly infamous great white shark, supposedly of record proportions, once patrolled the area that comprises False Bay, South Africa, was said to be well over 7 metres (23?ft) during the early 1980s. This shark, known locally as the \\"Submarine\\", had a legendary reputation that was supposedly well founded. Though rumors have stated this shark was exaggerated in size or non-existent altogether, witness accounts by the then young Craig Anthony Ferreira, a notable shark expert in South Africa, and his father indicate an unusually large animal of considerable size and power (though it remains uncertain just how massive the shark was as it escaped capture each time it was hooked). Ferreira describes the four encounters with the giant shark he participated in with great detail in his book \\"Great White Sharks On Their Best Behavior\\".[43]\\r\\nOne contender in maximum size among the predatory sharks is the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). While tiger sharks which are typically both a few feet smaller and have a leaner, less heavy body structure than white sharks, have been confirmed to reach at least 5.5 metres (18?ft) in the length, an unverified specimen was reported to have measured 7.4 metres (24?ft) in length and weighed 3,110 kilograms (6,860?lb), more than two times heavier than the largest confirmed specimen at 1,524 kilograms (3,360?lb).[30][44][45] Some other macropredatory sharks such as the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) and the Pacific sleeper shark (S. pacificus) are also reported to rival these sharks in length (but probably weigh a bit less since they are more slender in build than a great white) in exceptional cases.[46][47] The question of maximum weight is complicated by the unresolved question of whether or not to include the shark's stomach contents when weighing the shark. With a single bite a great white can take in up to 14?kg (31?lb) of flesh, and can also consume several hundred kilograms of food.\\r\\nGreat white sharks, like all other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the electromagnetic field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.[48]\\r\\nTo more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a \\"rete mirabile\\" (Latin for \\"wonderful net\\"). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to 14?C (25?F)[49] above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white shark's success in raising its core temperature is an example of gigantothermy. Therefore, the great white shark can be considered an endothermic poikilotherm because its body temperature is not constant but is internally regulated.[28] Great whites also rely on the fat and oils stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans.[50] Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that In addition to controlling the sharks' buoyancy, the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns. Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.[51]\\r\\nA 2007 study from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, used CT scans of a shark's skull and computer models to measure the shark's maximum bite force. The study reveals the forces and behaviors its skull is adapted to handle and resolves competing theories about its feeding behavior.[52] In 2008, a team of scientists led by Stephen Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the great white shark's jaw power and findings indicated that a specimen massing 3,324?kg (7,328?lb) could exert a bite force of 18,216 newtons (4,095?lbf).[37]\\r\\nThis shark's behavior and social structure is not well understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.\\r\\nThe great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as spy-hopping. This behavior has also been seen in at least one group of blacktip reef sharks, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable \\"clans\\" of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.[53]\\r\\nGreat white sharks are carnivorous and prey upon fish (e.g. tuna, rays,[53] other sharks[53]), cetaceans (i.e., dolphins, porpoises, whales), pinnipeds (e.g. seals, fur seals,[53] and sea lions), sea turtles,[53] sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and seabirds.[54] Great whites have also been known to eat objects that they are unable to digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish including other elasmobranchs, as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of 3 meters (9.8?ft) or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species.[55] Upon approaching a length of nearly 4 meters (13?ft), great white sharks begin to target predominately marine mammals for food, though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences.[56][57] They seem to be highly opportunistic.[58][59] These sharks prefer prey with a high content of energy-rich fat. Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal, a pig, and a sheep from his boat in the South Farallons. The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.[60]\\r\\nOff California, sharks immobilize northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) with a large bite to the hindquarters (which is the main source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between 1,500 and 2,000?kg (3,300 and 4,400?lb), and are potentially dangerous adversaries.[61][62] Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies.[63] Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.[64]\\r\\nWhite sharks also attack dolphins and porpoises from above, behind or below to avoid being detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus),[40] Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus),[40] bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.),[40][65] Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.),[65] harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena),[40] and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli).[40] Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour.[65] White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a 1.8-meter (5.9?ft) juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark.[66] In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales.[40][65] Cases where an adult Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around 1,100?kg (2,400?lb),[67] and a juvenile Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at 3?m (9.8?ft), were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed.[68] When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), has been found in great white shark stomachs.[58]\\r\\nOff Seal Island, False Bay in South Africa, the sharks ambush brown fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) from below at high speeds, hitting the seal mid-body. They can go so fast that they completely leave the water. The peak burst speed is estimated to be above 40 kilometers per hour (25?mph).[69] They have also been observed chasing prey after a missed attack. Prey is usually attacked at the surface.[70] Shark attacks most often occur in the morning, within 2 hours of sunrise, when visibility is poor. Their success rate is 55% in the first 2 hours, falling to 40% in late morning after which hunting stops.[53]\\r\\nWhale carcasses comprise an important part of the diet of white sharks. However, this has rarely been observed due to whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that 30?kg (66?lb) of whale blubber could feed a 4.5?m (15?ft) white shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection, spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale caudal peduncle and fluke, the sharks would investigate the carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding bouts of 15ÿ20 seconds the sharks removed flesh with lateral headshakes, without the protective ocular rotation they employ when attacking live prey. The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of blubber and immediately returning to feed, possibly in order to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield pieces, using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish them. After feeding for several hours, the sharks appeared to become lethargic, no longer swimming to the surface; they were observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite hard enough to remove flesh, they would instead bounce off and slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding simultaneously, bumping into each other without showing any signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit the head of a neighbouring shark, leaving two teeth embedded, but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away. Unusually for the area, large numbers of sharks over five metres long were observed, suggesting that the largest sharks change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the maneuverability required to hunt seals. The investigating team concluded that the importance of whale carcasses, particularly for the largest white sharks, has been underestimated.[71] In another documented incident, white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks.[72]\\r\\nStomach contents of great whites also indicates that whale sharks both juvenile and adult may also be included on the animal's menu, though whether this is active hunting or scavenging is not known at present.[73][74]\\r\\nGreat white sharks were previously thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 years to reach sexual maturity.[9][75][76] Maximum life span was originally believed to be more than 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.[8]\\r\\nLittle is known about the great white shark's mating habits. It is possible that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating.[71] Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth.[77] The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer.[78] The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.[citation needed]\\r\\nA breach is the result of a high speed approach to the surface with the resulting momentum taking the shark partially or completely clear of the water. This is a hunting technique employed by great white sharks whilst hunting seals. This technique is often used on cape fur seals at Seal Island in False Bay, South Africa. Because the behavior is unpredictable, it is very hard to document. It was first photographed by Chris Fallows and Rob Lawrence who developed the technique of towing a slow-moving seal decoy to trick the sharks to breach.[79] Between April and September, scientists may observe around 600 breaches. The seals swim on the surface and the great white sharks launch their predatory attack from the deeper water below. They can reach speeds of up to 40 kilometers per hour (25?mph) and can at times launch themselves more than 3.0 metres (10?ft) into the air. Just under half of observed breach attacks are successful.[80] In 2011, a 3-meter (9.8?ft) long shark jumped onto a seven-person research vessel off Seal Island in Mossel Bay. The crew were undertaking a population study using sardines as bait, and the incident was judged not to be an attack on the boat but an accident.[81]\\r\\nInterspecific competition between the great white shark and the orca is probable in regions where dietary preferences of both species may overlap.[65] An incident was documented on 4 October 1997, in the Farallon Islands off California in the United States. An estimated 4.7ÿ5.3-meter (15ÿ17?ft) female orca immobilized an estimated 3ÿ4-meter (9.8ÿ13.1?ft) great white shark.[82] The orca held the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility and kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate. The orca then proceeded to eat the dead shark's liver.[65][82][83] It is believed that the scent of the slain shark's carcass caused all the great whites in the region to flee, forfeiting an opportunity for a great seasonal feed.[84] Another similar attack apparently occurred there in 2000, but its outcome is not clear.[85] After both attacks, the local population of about 100 great whites vanished.[83][85] Following the 2000 incident, a great white with a satellite tag was found to have immediately submerged to a depth of 500?m (1,600?ft) and swum to Hawaii.[85] In 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a great white shark off South Australia.[86] In 2017, along the South African coast, four great whites were found washed ashore with their livers removed with what was described as 'surgical precision'. Local scientists claim that pods of orcas in the area were to blame for the attacks.[87][88]\\r\\nIt is unclear how much of a concurrent increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable.[2] Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.\\r\\nThe IUCN notes that very little is known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears uncommon compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable.[2] It is included in Appendix II of CITES,[15] meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit.[89] As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks.[90] A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range.[91] According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2000 great white sharks near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.[92][93]\\r\\nFishermen target many sharks for their jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely an object of commercial fishing, although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as smooth-hound shark.\\r\\nThe great white shark was declared Vulnerable by the Australian Government in 1999 because of significant population decline and is currently protected under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.[94] The causes of decline prior to protection included mortality from sport fishing harvests as well as being caught in beach protection netting.[95]\\r\\nThe national conservation status of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction.[94] Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as Threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.[94]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Australian government created the White Shark Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation in addition to federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities.[95] An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions.[96] A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's White Shark population was separated by Bass Strait into genetically distinct eastern and western populations, indicating a need for the development of regional conservation strategies.[97]\\r\\nPresently, human-caused shark mortality is continuing, primarily from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing as well as from being caught in beach protection netting, and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.[96]\\r\\nAs of April 2007, great white sharks were fully protected within 370 kilometers (230?mi) of New Zealand and additionally from fishing by New Zealand-flagged boats outside this range. The maximum penalty is a $250,000 fine and up to six months in prison.[98]\\r\\nIn 2013, great white sharks were added to California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the population of great whites in the North Pacific was estimated to be fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.[99]\\r\\nA 2014 study estimated the population of great white sharks along the California coastline to be approximately 2,400.[100][101]\\r\\nIn 2015 Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its significant and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to both protect the sharks and public health.[102]\\r\\nWhile the term \\"shark attack\\" is in common use for instances of humans being wounded by sharks, it has been suggested that this is based largely on the misconception that white sharks and other large predatory sharks (such as bull and tiger sharks) seek out humans as prey. A recent review recommends that only in the very rare instances where a shark clearly predated on a human should the bite incident be termed an \\"attack,\\" which implies predation, and that otherwise it is more accurate to class bite incidents as \\"sighting\\", \\"encounter\\", \\"bite incident\\", or \\"fatal bite incident\\". Sightings do not include physical interaction, encounters include physical interaction without harm, shark bites include minor and major shark bite incidents, including those that do and do not require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents are those that result in death. The study suggests that only in a case where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.[103]\\r\\nOf all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans, with 272 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of 2012.[17]\\r\\nMore than any documented bite incident, Peter Benchley's best-selling novel Jaws and the subsequent 1975 film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg provided the great white shark with the image of being a \\"man eater\\" in the public mind.[104] While great white sharks have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked bite incidents, they typically do not target them: for example, in the Mediterranean Sea there have been 31 confirmed bite incidents against humans in the last two centuries, most of which were non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be \\"test-bites\\". Great white sharks also test-bite buoys, flotsam, and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a surfboard to identify what it is.\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals.[105] Many bite incidents occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.[106]\\r\\nHumans are not appropriate prey because the shark's digestion is too slow to cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.[107]\\r\\nHowever, some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability to move out of reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.[108]\\r\\nIn 2014 the state government of Western Australia led by Premier Colin Barnett implemented a policy of killing large sharks. The policy, colloquially referred to as the Western Australian shark cull, was intended to protect users of the marine environment from shark bite incidents, following the deaths of seven people on the Western Australian coastline in the years 2010ÿ2013.[109] Baited drum lines were deployed near popular beaches using hooks designed to catch great white sharks, as well as bull and tiger sharks. Large sharks found hooked but still alive were shot and their bodies discarded at sea.[110] The government claimed they were not culling the sharks, but were using a \\"targeted, localised, hazard mitigation strategy\\".[111] Barnett described opposition as \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"extreme\\", and said that nothing could change his mind.[112] This policy was met with widespread condemnation from the scientific community, which showed that species responsible for bite incidents were notoriously hard to identify, that the drum lines failed to capture white sharks, as intended, and that the government also failed to show any correlation between their drum line policy and a decrease in shark bite incidents in the region.[113]\\r\\nGreat white sharks infrequently bite and sometimes even sink boats. Only five of the 108 authenticated unprovoked shark bite incidents reported from the Pacific Coast during the 20th century involved kayakers.[114] In a few cases they have bitten boats up to 10 meters (33?ft) in length. They have bumped or knocked people overboard, usually biting the boat from the stern. In one case in 1936, a large shark leapt completely into the South African fishing boat Lucky Jim, knocking a crewman into the sea. Tricas and McCosker's underwater observations suggest that sharks are attracted to boats by the electrical fields they generate, which are picked up by the ampullae of Lorenzini and confuse the shark about whether or not wounded prey might be near-by.[115]\\r\\nPrior to August 1981, no great white shark in captivity lived longer than 11 days. In August 1981, a white shark survived for 16 days at SeaWorld San Diego before being released.[116] The idea of containing a live great white at SeaWorld Orlando was used in the 1983 film Jaws 3-D.\\r\\nIn 1984, shortly before its opening day, the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California, housed its first great white shark which had died after 10 days. In July 2003, Monterey researchers captured a small female and kept it in a large netted pen near Malibu for five days. They had the rare success of getting the shark to feed in captivity before its release.[117] Not until September 2004 was the aquarium able to place a great white on long-term exhibit. A young female, which was caught off the coast of Ventura, was kept in the aquarium's 3,800,000-liter (1,000,000?U.S.?gal) Outer Bay exhibit for 198 days before she was released in March 2005. She was tracked for 30 days after release.[118] On the evening of 31 August 2006, the aquarium introduced a juvenile male caught outside Santa Monica Bay.[119] His first meal as a captive was a large salmon steak on 8 September 2006, and as of that date, he was estimated to be 1.72 meters (68?in) in length and to weigh approximately 47 kilograms (104?lb). He was released on 16 January 2007, after 137 days in captivity.\\r\\nMonterey Bay Aquarium housed a third great white, a juvenile male, for 162 days between 27 August 2007, and 5 February 2008. On arrival, he was 1.4?m (4.6?ft) long and weighed 30.6?kg (67?lb). He grew to 1.8?m (5.9?ft) and 64?kg (141?lb) before release. A juvenile female came to the Outer Bay Exhibit on 27 August 2008. While she did swim well, the shark fed only one time during her stay and was tagged and released on 7 September 2008. Another juvenile female was captured near Malibu on 12 August 2009, introduced to the Outer Bay exhibit on 26 August 2009, and was successfully released into the wild on 4 November 2009.[120] The Monterey Bay Aquarium added a 1.4-meter (4.6?ft) long male into their redesigned \\"Open Sea\\" exhibit on 31 August 2011. The animal was captured in the waters off of Malibu.\\r\\nOne of the largest adult great whites ever exhibited was at Japan's Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in 2016, where a 3.5 meters (11?ft) male was exhibited for three days before dying.[121][122] Probably the most famous captive was a 2.4?m (7.9?ft) female named Sandy, which in August 1980 became the only great white to be housed at the California Academy of Sciences' Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco, California. She was released because she would not eat and constantly bumped against the walls.[123]\\r\\nCage diving is most common at sites where great whites are frequent including the coast of South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia,[124] and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at the focus of a booming tourist industry.[125][126] A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.\\r\\nAt present, hang baits are illegal off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive operators do not use them. Operators in South Africa and Australia continue to use hang baits and pinniped decoys.[127] In South Australia, playing rock music recordings underwater, including the AC/DC album Back in Black has also been used experimentally to attract sharks.[128]\\r\\nCompanies object to being blamed for shark bite incidents, pointing out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans.[129] Their position is that further research needs to be done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior.[130] One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.[127]\\r\\nThe shark tourist industry has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to S20,000. That is a fraction of the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between S50 and S150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between S9,000 and S27,000 of revenue daily.[131]\\r\\nPutting chum in the water\\r\\nA great white shark approaches divers in a cage off Dyer Island, Western Cape, South Africa.\\r\\nA great white shark approaches a cage","input":"Where was the biggest great white shark found?"},{"output":"Paedophryne amauensis frogs","context":"The smallest organisms found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of organism size; including volume, mass, height, length, or genome size.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the incomplete nature of scientific knowledge, it is possible that the smallest organism is undiscovered. Furthermore, there is some debate over the definition of life, and what entities qualify as organisms; consequently the smallest known organism (microorganism) is debatable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany biologists consider viruses to be non-living because they lack a cellular structure and cannot metabolize by themselves, requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesize new products. A minority of scientists hold that, because viruses do have genetic material and can employ the metabolism of their host, they can be considered organisms. As well, an emerging idea that is gaining traction among some virologists is the concept of the virocell, in which the actual phenotype of a virus is the infected cell, and the virus particle is simply a reproductive or dispersal stage, much like pollen or a spore.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smallest viruses in terms of genome size are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. Perhaps the most famous is the bacteriophage Phi-X174 with a genome size of 5386 nucleotides.[2]  However, some ssDNA viruses can be even smaller. For example, Porcine circovirus type 1 has a genome of only 1759 nucleotides[3] and a capsid diameter of only 17?nm.[4] As a whole, the viral family geminiviridae is only about 30?nm in length. However, the two capsids making up the virus are fused; divided, the capsids would be 15?nm in length. Other environmentally characterized ssDNA viruses such as CRESS DNA viruses as well as others can have genomes that are considerably less that 2,000 nucleotides.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smallest RNA viruses in terms of genome size are small retroviruses such as rous sarcoma virus with genomes of 3.5 kilo base pairs (kb) and particle diameters of 80 nanometres (nm). The smallest double stranded DNA viruses are the hepadnaviruses such as Hepatitis B, at 3.2 kb and 42?nm; parvoviruses have smaller capsids, at 18-26?nm, but larger genomes, at 5 kb. It is important to consider other self replicating genetic elements, such as satelliviruses, viroids and ribozymes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genome of Nasuia deltocephalinicola, a symbiont of the European pest leafhopper, Macrosteles quadripunctulatus consists of a circular chromosome of 112,031 base pairs.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nNanoarchaeum equitans's genome is 490,885 nucleotides long.\\r\\n\\r\\nPelagibacter ubique is one of the smallest known free-living bacterium with a length of 0.37-0.89 m and an average cell diameter of 0.12-0.20 m.

However, the vast majority of bacterial strains have not been studied, and the marine ultramicrobacteria Sphingomonas sp strain RB2256 is reported to have passed through a 220?nm ultrafilter.

In general these extremely small frogs occur in tropical forest and montane environments.

The young man is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Additional roles were played by Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price and Alan Arkin.\\r\\nBurton conceived Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Caroline Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox, after Warner Bros. declined. Edward Scissorhands was then fast tracked after Burton's critical and financial success with Batman. The majority of filming took place in Lakeland, Florida between March 10 and June 10, 1990.[4] The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman. The leading role of Edward had been connected to several actors prior to Depp's casting: a meeting between Burton and the preferred choice of the studio, Tom Cruise, was not fruitful, and Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part. The character of The Inventor was devised specifically for Vincent Price, and would be his last major role. Edward's scissor hands were created and designed by Stan Winston.\\r\\nEdward Scissorhands was released to positive feedback from critics, and was a financial success. The film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and the Saturn Awards, as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn elderly woman tells her granddaughter the story of a young man named Edward who has scissor blades for hands. As the creation of an old Inventor, Edward is an artificially created human who is almost completed. The Inventor homeschools Edward, but suffers a fatal heart attack and died before he could attach hands to Edward.\\r\\nSome years later, Peg Boggs, a local Avon door-to-door saleswoman, visits the decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her family: her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Despite their initial fear of Edward, they come to see him as a kind person.\\r\\nThe Boggs' neighbors are curious about their new house guest, and the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming Edward. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as he does not have a background or financial history.\\r\\nJealous of Kim's attraction to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick the lock on his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.\\r\\nDuring Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice sculpture modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.\\r\\nKim races after Edward, while Jim obtains a handgun and follows Kim. In the mansion, Jim ambushes Edward and fights with him; Edward refuses to fight back until he sees Jim slap Kim as she attempts to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a window of the mansion, killing him. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him before departing. As the police and neighbors gather, Kim leads them to believe that Jim and Edward killed each other.\\r\\nThe elderly woman finishes telling her granddaughter the story, revealing that she is Kim and saying that she never saw Edward again. She prefers not to visit him because decades have passed and she wants him to remember her as she was in her youth. She thinks Edward is still alive, immortal because he is artificial, and because of the \\"snow\\" which Edward creates when carving ice sculptures.\\r\\nThe genesis of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing by then-teenaged director Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. \\"I get the feeling people just got this urge to want to leave me alone for some reason, I don't know exactly why.\\" During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was \\"about an abortion that came back to life\\". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands.[5] \\"Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal\\", Thompson remarked.[6] She wrote Scissorhands as a \\"love poem\\" to Burton, calling him \\"the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together\\".[7]\\r\\nShortly after Thompson's hiring, Burton began to develop Edward Scissorhands at Warner Bros., with whom he worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice. However, within a couple of months, Warner sold the film rights to 20th Century Fox.[8] Fox agreed to finance Thompson's screenplay while giving Burton complete creative control. At the time, the budget was projected to be around $8ÿ9 million.[9] When writing the storyline, Burton and Thompson were influenced by Universal Horror films, such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), The Phantom of the Opera (1925), Frankenstein (1931), and Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), as well as King Kong (1933) and various fairy tales. Burton originally wanted to make Scissorhands as a musical, feeling \\"it seemed big and operatic to me\\", but later dropped the idea.[10] Following the enormous success of Batman, Burton arrived to the status of being an A-list director. He had the opportunity to do any film he wanted, but rather than fast track Warner Bros.' choices for Batman Returns[5] or Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, Burton opted to make Edward Scissorhands for Fox.[11]\\r\\nAlthough Winona Ryder was the first cast member attached to the script,[10] Dianne Wiest was the first to sign on. \\"Dianne, in particular, was wonderful\\", Burton said. \\"She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested\\".[12] When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered;[13] Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. \\"He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him\\", Burton remembered. \\"He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up\\".[12] Cruise asked for a \\"happier\\" ending.[14] Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part,[15] the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The Bonfire of the Vanities.[16] Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: \\"Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late.\\"[17] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role,[18] while Thompson favored John Cusack.[13] Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest,[16] although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.[13]\\r\\nThough Burton was unfamiliar with Johnny Depp's then-popular performance in 21 Jump Street, he had always been Burton's first choice.[12] At the time of his casting, Depp was wanting to break out of the teen idol status which his performance in 21 Jump Street had afforded him. When he was sent the script, Depp \\"wept like a newborn\\" and immediately found personal and emotional connections with the story.[19] In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue.[20] Fox studio executives were so worried about Edward's image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until release of the film.[21] Burton approached Ryder for the role of Kim Boggs based on their positive working experience in Beetlejuice.[12] Drew Barrymore previously auditioned for the role.[22] Crispin Glover auditioned for the role of Jim before Anthony Michael Hall was cast.[9]\\r\\nKathy Baker saw her part of Joyce, the neighbor who tries to seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy.[10] Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was \\"a bit baffled. Nothing really made sense to me until I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary\\".[10] The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.[23]\\r\\nBurbank, California was considered as a possible location for the suburban neighborhoods, but Burton believed the city had become too altered since his childhood[12] so the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, including the town of Lutz and the Southgate Shopping Center of Lakeland was chosen for a three-month shooting schedule.[6] The production crew found, in the words of the production designer Bo Welch, \\"a kind of generic, plain-wrap suburb, which we made even more characterless by painting all the houses in faded pastels, and reducing the window sizes to make it look a little more paranoid.\\"[24] The key element to unify the look of the neighborhood was Welch's decision to repaint each of the houses in one of four colors, which he described as \\"sea-foam green, dirty flesh, butter, and dirty blue\\".[25] The facade of the Gothic mansion was built just outside Dade City. Filming Edward Scissorhands created hundreds of (temporary) jobs and injected over $4 million into the Tampa Bay economy.[26] Production then moved to a Fox Studios sound stage in Century City, California, where interiors of the mansion were filmed.[24]\\r\\nTo create Edward's scissor hands, Burton employed Stan Winston, who would later design the Penguin's prosthetic makeup in Batman Returns.[27] Depp's wardrobe and prosthetic makeup took one hour and 45 minutes to apply.[28] The giant topiaries that Edward creates in the film were made by wrapping metal skeletons in chicken wire, then weaving in thousands of small plastic plant sprigs.[29] Rick Heinrichs worked as one of the art directors.\\r\\nEdward Scissorhands is the fourth feature film collaboration between director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman. The orchestra consisted of 79 musicians.[30] Elfman cites Scissorhands as epitomizing his most personal and favorite work. In addition to Elfman's music, three Tom Jones songs also appear: \\"It's Not Unusual\\", \\"Delilah\\" and \\"With These Hands\\". \\"It's Not Unusual\\" would later be used in Mars Attacks! (1996), another film of Burton's with music composed by Elfman.[31]\\r\\nBurton acknowledged that the main themes of Edward Scissorhands deal with self-discovery and isolation. Edward is found living alone in the attic of a Gothic castle, a setting that is also used for main characters in Burton's Batman and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Edward Scissorhands climaxes much like James Whale's Frankenstein and Burton's own Frankenweenie. A mob confronts the \\"evil creature\\", in this case, Edward, at his castle. With Edward unable to consummate his love for Kim because of his appearance, the film can also be seen as being influenced by Beauty and the Beast. Edward Scissorhands is a fairy tale book-ended by a prologue and an epilogue featuring Kim Boggs as an old woman telling her granddaughter the story,[27] augmenting the German Expressionism and Gothic fiction archetypes.[32]\\r\\nBurton explained that his depiction of suburbia is \\"not a bad place. It's a weird place. I tried to walk the fine line of making it funny and strange without it being judgmental. It's a place where there's a lot of integrity.\\"[25] Kim leaves her jock boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton's revenge against jocks he encountered as a teenager in suburban Burbank, CA. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered. Burton referred to this scene as a \\"high school fantasy\\".[27]\\r\\nTest screenings for the film were encouraging for 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands on the scale of \\"an E.T.-sized blockbuster,\\" but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. \\"We have to let it find its place. We want to be careful not to hype the movie out of the universe,\\" he reasoned.[33] Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. Edward Scissorhands eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film was declared to be a box office success.[34] The New York Times wrote \\"the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were both together in real life at the time (1989ÿ1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences.\\"[28]\\r\\nEdward Scissorhands received acclaim from critics and audiences. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that the film holds an 89% approval rating, based on 56 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The first collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands is a magical modern fairy tale with gothic overtones and a sweet center.\\"[35] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 77 (out of 100) based on 19 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be \\"generally favorable\\".[36] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a \\"A-\\" grade.[37]\\r\\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone praised the piece by stating, \\"Burton's richly entertaining update of the Frankenstein story is the year's most comic, romantic and haunting film fantasy.\\" He continued by praising Depp's performance stating, \\"Depp artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it's a terrific performance\\" and the \\"engulfing score\\" from Danny Elfman.[38] Staff of Variety spoke highly of the film, \\"Director [Burton] takes a character as wildly unlikely as a boy whose arms end in pruning shears, and makes him the center of a delightful and delicate comic fable.\\"[39]\\r\\nMarc Lee of The Daily Telegraph scored the film five out of five stars, writing, \\"Burton's modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts.\\" whilst additionally adding praise to Depp's performance, \\"[Depp] is sensational in the lead role, summoning anxiety, melancholy and innocence with heartbreaking conviction. And it's all in the eyes: his dialogue is cut-to-the-bone minimal.\\"[40]\\r\\nDesson Thomson of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin.\\"[41] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post granted the film praise, \\"Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin.\\" She too praised Depp's performance in stating, \\"... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.[42]\\r\\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \\"A-\\" rating and praised it in \\"The romanticism has a personal dimension ÿ for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light.\\" He also commented very positively on character of Edward, \\"... who is Burton's purest achievement as a director so far.\\" Of Depp he wrote, \\"Depp may not be doing that much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, but what he does is tremulous and affecting.\\" As well as Elfman's score of the piece by saying it to be, \\"[A] lovely, storybook score highlights the pop romanticism of Burton's conception.

In addition, Winston was nominated for his visual effects work.[46] Depp was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost to Grard Depardieu of Green Card.[47] Edward Scissorhands was able to win the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation[48] and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. Danny Elfman, Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, and Atwood received individual nominations.[49] Elfman was also given a Grammy Award nomination.[11]\\r\\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\\r\\nBurton cites Edward Scissorhands as epitomizing his most personal work.[11] The film is also Burton's first collaboration with actor Johnny Depp and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky. In October 2008, the Hallmark Channel purchased the television rights.[52] Metal band Motionless in White have a song entitled \\"Scissorhands (The Last Snow)\\", with its lyrics written about the film in homage to its legacy and impact on the gothic subculture.[53] Scottish indie rock band The Twilight Sad named a mini-album Here, It Never Snowed.

The bell can pulsate to acquire propulsion and locomotion. The tentacles may be utilized to capture prey or defend against predators by emitting toxins in a painful sting. Jellyfish species are classified in the subphylum Medusozoa which makes up a major part of the phylum Cnidaria, although not all Medusozoa species are considered to be jellyfish.\\r\\nJellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. Scyphozoans are exclusively marine, but some hydrozoans live in freshwater. Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide. Jellyfish have roamed the seas for at least 500 million years,[2] and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal.[3]\\r\\nThe popular English name jellyfish has been in use since 1796.[4] It has traditionally also been applied to other animals sharing a superficial resemblance, for example ctenophores (members from another phylum of common, gelatinous and generally transparent or translucent, free-swimming planktonic carnivores now known as comb jellies) were included as \\"jellyfishes\\".[5] Even some scientists include the phylum ctenophora when they are referring to jellyfish.[6] Other scientists prefer to use the more all-encompassing term gelatinous zooplankton, when referring to these, together with other soft-bodied animals in the water column.[7]\\r\\nAs jellyfish are not true fish, which are vertebrates, the word jellyfish is considered by some to be a misnomer. Public aquaria often use the terms jellies or sea jellies instead.[8] The term \\"jellies\\" may have become more popular than \\"jellyfish\\".[1] In scientific literature, \\"jelly\\" and \\"jellyfish\\" are often used interchangeably.[9] Some sources may use the term \\"jelly\\" to refer to organisms in this taxon, as \\"jellyfish\\" may be considered inappropriate.[10]\\r\\nMany textbooks and sources refer to only scyphozoans as \\"true jellyfish\\".[11][12]\\r\\nA group of jellyfish is sometimes called a bloom or a swarm.[13] \\"Bloom\\" is usually used for a large group of jellyfish that gather in a small area, but may also have a time component, referring to seasonal increases, or numbers beyond what was expected.[14] Other collective names for a group of jellyfish are \\"fluther\\"[15] and \\"smack,\\"[16] though neither term is commonly used by scientists who study jellyfish. Jellyfish are \\"bloomy\\" by nature of their life cycles, being produced by their benthic polyps usually in the spring when sunshine and plankton increase, so they appear rather suddenly and often in large numbers, even when an ecosystem is in balance.[17] Using \\"swarm\\" usually implies some kind of active ability to stay together, which a few species such as Aurelia, the moon jelly, demonstrate.[18]\\r\\nMedusa jellyfish may be classified as scyphomedusae (\\"true\\" jellyfish), stauromedusae (stalked jellyfish), cubomedusae (box jellyfish), or hydromedusae, according to which clade their species belongs.[19]\\r\\nThe term medusa was coined by Linnaeus in 1752, alluding to the tentacled head of Medusa in Greek mythology.[4] This term refers exclusively to the non-polyp life-stage which occurs in many cnidarians, which is typified by a large pulsating gelatinous bell with long trailing tentacles. All medusa-producing species belong to the sub-phylum Medusozoa.\\r\\nIn biology, a medusa (plural: medusae) is a form of cnidarian in which the body is shaped like an umbrella, in contrast with polyps. Medusae vary from bell-shaped to the shape of a thin disk, scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below. The upper or aboral surface is called the exumbrella and the lower surface is called the subumbrella; the mouth is located on the lower surface, which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin (called the velum). The digestive cavity consists of the gastrovascular cavity and radiating canals which extend toward the margin; these canals may be simple or branching, and vary in number from few to many. The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and tentacles.\\r\\nGerman biologist Ernst Haeckel popularized medusae through his vivid illustrations, particularly in Kunstformen der Natur.\\r\\nMost jellyfish do not have specialized digestive, osmoregulatory, central nervous, respiratory, or circulatory systems. The manubrium is a stalk-like structure hanging down from the centre of the underside, often surrounded by oral arms, which connects with the mouth/anus at the base of the bell.[20] This opens into the gastrovascular cavity, where digestion takes place and nutrients are absorbed. It is joined to the radial canals which extend to the margin of the bell, where tentacles are attached.[21] Nematocysts, which deliver the sting, are located mostly on the tentacles; Scyphozoans also have them around the mouth and stomach.[22] Jellyfish do not need a respiratory system since their skin is thin enough that the body is oxygenated by diffusion. They have limited control over movement, but can use their hydrostatic skeleton to navigate through contraction-pulsations of the bell-like body; some species actively swim most of the time, while others are mostly passive.[23] Depending on the species, the body contains between 95 and 98% water.[24] Most of the umbrella mass is a gelatinous material  the jelly  called mesoglea which is surrounded by two layers of protective skin. The top layer is called the epidermis, and the inner layer is referred to as gastrodermis, which lines the gut.\\r\\nJellyfish employ a loose network of nerves, located in the epidermis, which is called a \\"nerve net\\".[25] Although traditionally thought not to have a central nervous system, nerve net concentration and ganglion-like structures could be considered to constitute one in most species.[26] A jellyfish detects various stimuli including the touch of other animals via this nerve net, which then transmits impulses both throughout the nerve net and around a circular nerve ring, through the rhopalial lappet, located at the rim of the jellyfish body, to other nerve cells.\\r\\nSome jellyfish have ocelli: light-sensitive organs that do not form images but which can detect light and are used to determine up from down, responding to sunlight shining on the water's surface. These are generally pigment spot ocelli, which have some cells (not all) pigmented.\\r\\nCertain species of jellyfish, such as the box jellyfish, have more advanced vision than their counterparts. The box jellyfish has 24 eyes, two of which are capable of seeing color, and four parallel information processing areas or rhopalia that act in competition,[27] supposedly making it one of the few creatures to have a 360-degree view of its environment.[28]\\r\\nThe eyes are suspended on stalks with heavy crystals on one end, acting like a gyroscope to orient the eyes skyward. They look upward to navigate from roots in mangrove swamps to the open lagoon and back, watching for the mangrove canopy, where they feed.[3]\\r\\nJellyfish range from about one millimeter in bell height and diameter to nearly 2 metres (6.6?ft) in bell height and diameter; the tentacles and mouth parts usually extend beyond this bell dimension.\\r\\nThe smallest jellyfish are the peculiar creeping jellyfish in the genera Staurocladia and Eleutheria, which have bell disks from 0.5?mm to a few millimeters in diameter, with short tentacles that extend out beyond this, which these jellyfish use to move across the surface of seaweed or the bottoms of rocky pools.[29] Many of these tiny creeping jellyfish cannot be seen in the field without a hand lens or microscope; they can reproduce asexually by splitting in half (called fission). Other very small jellyfish, which have bells about one millimeter, are the hydromedusae of many species that have just been released from their parent polyps;[30] some of these live only a few minutes before shedding their gametes in the plankton and then dying, while others will grow in the plankton for weeks or months. The hydromedusae Cladonema radiatum and Cladonema californicum are also very small, living for months, yet never growing beyond a few mm in bell height and diameter.[31] Another small species of jellyfish is the Australian Irukandji, which is about the size of a fingernail.[3]\\r\\nThe lion's mane jellyfish, Cyanea capillata, was long-cited as the largest jellyfish, and arguably the longest animal in the world, with fine, thread-like tentacles that may extend up to 36.5 metres (120?ft) long (though most are nowhere near that large).[32][33] They have a moderately painful, but rarely fatal, sting.\\r\\nThe increasingly common giant Nomura's jellyfish, Nemopilema nomurai, found in some, but not all years in the waters of Japan, Korea and China in summer and autumn is another candidate for \\"largest jellyfish\\", in terms of diameter and weight, since the largest Nomura's jellyfish in late autumn can reach 200 centimetres (79?in) in bell (body) diameter and about 200 kilograms (440?lb) in weight, with average specimens frequently reaching 90 centimetres (35?in) in bell diameter and about 150 kilograms (330?lb) in weight.[34][35] The large bell mass of the giant Nomura's jellyfish[36] can dwarf a diver and is nearly always much greater than the up-to-100 centimetres (39?in) bell diameter Lion's Mane.[37]\\r\\nThe rarely encountered deep-sea jellyfish Stygiomedusa gigantea is another candidate for \\"largest jellyfish\\", with its thick, massive bell up to 100 centimetres (39?in) wide, and four thick, \\"strap-like\\" oral arms extending up to 6 metres (20?ft) in length,[38] very different from the typical fine, threadlike tentacles that rim the umbrella of more-typical-looking jellyfish, including the Lion's Mane.\\r\\nJellyfish belong to Medusozoa, the clade of cnidarians which excludes Anthozoa (e.g., corals and anemones). This suggests that the medusa form evolved after the polyps.[39]\\r\\nThe phylogenetics of this group are complex and evolving. The Medusozoa and Octocorallia are proposed as sister groups according to research published in 2012. That research also proposes coronate Scyphozoa and Cubozoa as a sister clade to Hydrozoa and discomedusan Scyphozoa, which are themselves sister groups. The hydroidolinans are a sister group to Limnomedusae, also called Trachylina. Semaeostomae is paraphyletic with Rhizostomeae. The class Storozoa was the earliest group of Medusozoa to diverge and the Limnomedusae were the earliest Hydrozoa to diverge.[40]\\r\\nThe four major classes of medusozoan Cnidaria are:\\r\\nSome other animals are frequently associated with or mistaken for medusa jellyfish.\\r\\nThere are over 200 species of Scyphozoa, about 50 species of Staurozoa, about 20 species of Cubozoa, and the Hydrozoa includes about 1000ÿ1500 species that produce medusae (and many more hydrozoan species that do not produce medusae).[42][43]\\r\\nMany scientists who work on relationships between these groups are reluctant to assign ranks, although there is general agreement on the different groups, regardless of their absolute rank. Here is one scheme, which includes all groups that produce jellyfish, derived from several expert sources:\\r\\nJellyfish development occurs in multiple phases. Sperm fertilize eggs which develop into larval planulae, become polyps, bud into ephyrae and then transform into adult medusae. In some species, specimens may skip some phases.[51]\\r\\nThe planula is a small larva covered with cilia. It settles onto a firm surface and develops into a polyp.\\r\\nThe polyp is generally a small stalk with a mouth that is ringed by upward-facing tentacles. The polyps resemble the closely related Cnidaria anthozoan (sea anemones and corals) polyps. The jellyfish polyp may be sessile, living on the bottom or on another substrate such as floats or boat hulls, or it may be free-floating or attached to tiny bits of free-living plankton[52] or rarely, fish[53][54] or other invertebrates. Polyps may be solitary or colonial. Polyp colonies form by strobilation, in which multiple polyps share a common stomach cavity.[55] Most polyps are only millimeters in size. They feed continuously. The polyp stage may last for years.\\r\\nThe next stage is the ephyra, which is a free-swimming precursor of the final adult stage.\\r\\nThe ephyra then develops into a medusa. The medusa is the life stage that is typically identified as a jellyfish.[56]\\r\\nJellyfish reproduce both sexually and asexually. Upon reaching adult size, jellyfish spawn daily given enough food. In most species, spawning is controlled by light, so the entire population spawns at about the same time of day, often at either dusk or dawn.[57] Jellyfish are usually either male or female (with occasional hermaphrodites). In most cases, adults release sperm and eggs into the surrounding water, where the (unprotected) eggs are fertilized and mature into new organisms.\\r\\nAfter a growth interval, the polyp begins reproducing asexually by budding and, in the Scyphozoa, is called a segmenting polyp, or a scyphistoma. Budding produces more scyphistomae and also ephyrae. Budding sites vary by species; from the tentacle bulbs, the manubrium (above the mouth), or the gonads of hydromedusae.[52] Polyps asexually produce free-swimming ephyra, which then become a medusa. New specimens (usually only a millimeter or two across) swim away from the polyp and then grow. Some polyps can asexually produce a creeping frustule larval form, which then develops into another polyp.[citation needed]\\r\\nA few species can produce new medusae by budding directly from the medusan stage. Some hydromedusae reproduce by fission (splitting in half).[52] A few omit the planula, polyp and ephyra phases and produce new medusae directly from eggs.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn a few species, the sperm swim into the female's mouth, fertilizing the eggs within her body, where they remain during early development stages. In moon jellies, the eggs lodge in pits on the oral arms, which form a temporary brood chamber for the developing planula larvae.\\r\\nJellyfish lifespans typically range from a few hours (in the case of some very small hydromedusae) to several months; there are some indications that deep sea species may live on the order of years. Life span varies by species. Most large coastal jellyfish live 2 to 6 months, during which they grow from a millimeter or two to many centimeters in diameter.\\r\\nAquarium jellyfish that are carefully tended, fed daily even when food might be seasonally rare in the wild, and sometimes treated with antibiotics if they develop infections, may live several years, though this would be very unusual in the wild.\\r\\nAn unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, formerly classified as T. nutricula,[58] might be effectively immortal because of its ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory.[59] At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded that there are three species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may hold the key to immortality for human beings, as he says that genetically they are not that much different from humans.[60]\\r\\nJellyfish have been proven to be the most energy efficient swimmers of all animals.[61] They move through the water by radially expanding and contracting their bell-shaped bodies to push water behind them. They pause between the contraction and expansion to create two vortex rings. Muscles are used for the contraction of the body, which sheds the first vortex and pushes the animal forward, but the mesoglea is so elastic that the expansion is powered exclusively by relaxing the bell, which releases the energy stored from the contraction. By doing so, the second vortex ring rolls under it and begins to spin faster. This sucks in water which refills the bell and is pushed up against the centre of the body, giving it a secondary and \\"free\\" boost forward. The mechanism, called passive energy recapture, only works at low speeds and relatively small body sizes, allowing the animal to travel 30 percent farther on each swimming cycle. Jellyfish achieved a 48 percent lower cost of transport (the amount of food and oxygen consumed, versus energy spent in movement) than other animals in similar studies.[62][63][64]\\r\\nMedusae are carnivorous, feeding on plankton, crustaceans, fish eggs, small fish and other jellyfish, ingesting and voiding through the same hole in the middle of the bell. Jellies hunt passively using their tentacles as drift nets. Their swimming technique also helps them to capture prey; when their body expands it displaces more water which brings more potential prey within the reach of their tentacles.[66]\\r\\nOther species of jellyfish are among the most common and important jellyfish predators, some of which specialize in jellies. Sea anemones may eat jellyfish that drift into their range. Other predators include tuna, shark, swordfish, sea turtles, and at least one species of Pacific salmon. In general however, there are few predators preying on jellyfish and they can be considered top predators in the food chain. Not only do they eat fish eggs and juvenile fish, but they also compete for food resources, leading to jellyfish having a difficult-to-reverse dominant position in the ecosystem.[67]\\r\\nSea birds sometimes pick symbiotic crustaceans from the jellyfish bells near the sea's surface, inevitably feeding also on the jellyfish hosts of these amphipods or young crabs and shrimp.\\r\\nJellyfish bloom formation is a complex process that depends on ocean currents, nutrients, sunshine, temperature, season, prey availability, reduced predation and oxygen concentrations. Ocean currents tend to congregate jellyfish into large swarms or \\"blooms\\", consisting of hundreds or thousands of individuals. Blooms can also result from unusually high populations in some years. A recent study tracking swimming jellyfish revealed that these medusae can detect marine currents and swim against the current to congregate in blooms.[68] Jellyfish are better able to survive in nutrient-rich, oxygen-poor water than competitors, and thus can feast on plankton without competition. Jellyfish may also benefit from saltier waters, as saltier waters contain more iodine, which is necessary for polyps to turn into jellyfish. Rising sea temperatures caused by climate change may also contribute to jellyfish blooms, because many species of jellyfish are relatively better able to survive in warmer waters.[69]\\r\\nOne hypothesis is that the global increase in jellyfish bloom frequency may stem from human impact. In some locations jellyfish may be filling ecological niches formerly occupied by now overfished creatures, but this hypothesis lacks supporting data.[17] Youngbluth states that \\"jellyfish feed on the same kinds of prey as adult and young fish, so if fish are removed from the equation, jellyfish are likely to move in.\\"[70]\\r\\nSome jellyfish populations that have shown clear increases in the past few decades are invasive species, newly arrived from other habitats: examples include the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, central and eastern Mediterranean, Hawaii, and tropical and subtropical parts of the West Atlantic (including the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and Brazil).[71][72] Invasive populations can expand rapidly because they often face no predators in the new habitat.\\r\\nIncreased nutrients, ascribed to agricultural runoff, have been cited as contributing to jellyfish proliferation. Graham states, \\"ecosystems in which there are high levels of nutrients ... provide nourishment for the small organisms on which jellyfish feed. In waters where there is eutrophication, low oxygen levels often result, favoring jellyfish as they thrive in less oxygen-rich water than fish can tolerate. The fact that jellyfish are increasing is a symptom of something happening in the ecosystem.\\"[70]\\r\\nJellyfish populations may be expanding globally as a result of overfishing of their natural predators and the availability of excessive nutrients due to land runoff.[73][74] When marine ecosystems become disturbed jellyfish can proliferate. For example, jellyfish reproduce rapidly and have fast growth rates; they predate many species, while few species predate them; and they feed via touch rather than visually, so they can feed effectively at night and in turbid waters.[75][76] It may become difficult for fish stocks to reestablish themselves in marine ecosystems once they have become dominated by jellyfish, because jellyfish feed on plankton, which includes fish eggs and larvae.[77][78]\\r\\nMost jellyfish are marine animals, although a few hydromedusae inhabit freshwater. The best known freshwater example is the cosmopolitan hydrozoan jellyfish, Craspedacusta sowerbii. It is less than an inch (2.5?cm) in diameter, colorless and it does not sting.\\r\\nSome jellyfish populations have become restricted to coastal saltwater lakes, such as Jellyfish Lake in Palau.\\r\\nAlthough what first comes to mind as the common domain of jellyfish is living well up off the ocean floor in the plankton, a few species of jellyfish are closely associated with the bottom for much of their lives (that is, they can be considered benthic). The upside-down jellyfish in the genus Cassiopea typically lie on the bottom of shallow lagoons where they sometimes pulsate gently with their umbrella top facing down. The tiny creeping jellyfish Staurocladia and Eleutheria (see section on Size, above) cannot swim and \\"walk\\" around on seaweed fronds or rocky bottoms on their tentacles. Most hydromedusae and scyphomedusae that live in coastal habitats find themselves on the bottom periodically, where they may stop swimming for a while, and certain box jellyfish species also rest on the sea bed in shallow water.[79] Even some deep-sea species of hydromedusae and scyphomedusae are usually collected on or near the bottom. All of the stauromedusae are found attached to either seaweed or rocky or other firm material on the bottom.[80]\\r\\nSome species explicitly adapt to tidal flux. In Roscoe Bay, jellyfish ride the current at ebb tide until they hit a gravel bar, and then descend below the current. They remain in still waters until the tide rises, ascending and allowing it to sweep them back into the bay. They also actively avoid fresh water from mountain snowmelt, diving until they find enough salt.[3]\\r\\nJellyfish function as hosts for a wide variety of organisms. Endoparasitic helminths are transmitted from intermediate host jellyfish to definitive host fish via predation. Some digenean trematodes, especially species of the family Lepocreadiidae, are known to use jellyfish as their second intermediate hosts and/or paratenic hosts. Medusivorous fish become infected by trematodes through predation of infected jellyfish and act as definitive hosts.[81] [82]\\r\\nFisheries have begun harvesting the American cannonball jellyfish, Stomolophus meleagris, along the southern Atlantic coast of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico for export to Asia.[84]\\r\\nJellyfish are also harvested for their collagen, which can be used for a variety of applications including the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\\r\\nIn some countries, such as China, Japan, and Korea, jellyfish are known as a delicacy. \\"Dried jellyfish\\" has become increasingly popular throughout the world. The jellyfish is dried to prevent spoiling; if not dried they can spoil within a matter of hours. Once dried, they can be stored for weeks at a time. Only scyphozoan jellyfish belonging to the order Rhizostomeae are harvested for food; about 12 of the approximately 85 species. Most of the harvest takes place in southeast Asia.[85] Rhizostomes, especially Rhopilema esculentum in China (˗ hҊizh, \\"sea stingers\\") and Stomolophus meleagris (cannonball jellyfish) in the United States, are favored because of their larger and more rigid bodies and because their toxins are harmless to humans.[84]\\r\\nTraditional processing methods, carried out by a Jellyfish Master, involve a 20- to 40-day multi-phase procedure in which after removing the gonads and mucous membranes, the umbrella and oral arms are treated with a mixture of table salt and alum, and compressed. Processing reduces liquefaction, odor, and the growth of spoilage organisms, and makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a \\"crunchy and crispy texture.\\" Jellyfish prepared this way retain 7ÿ10% of their original weight, and the processed product contains approximately 94% water and 6% protein. Freshly processed jellyfish has a white, creamy color and turns yellow or brown during prolonged storage.\\r\\nIn China, processed jellyfish are desalted by soaking in water overnight and eaten cooked or raw. The dish is often served shredded with a dressing of oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar, or as a salad with vegetables. In Japan, cured jellyfish are rinsed, cut into strips and served with vinegar as an appetizer.[84][86] Desalted, ready-to-eat products are also available.[84]\\r\\nIn Israel, a start-up company called Cine'al has developed a super-absorbent substance made from jellyfish known as hydromash which they claim can be used to make diapers, tampons, and paper towels. Hydrosmash was inspired by research from the University of Tel Aviv, which found that jellyfish were made up of a material that could \\"absorb high volume of liquids and hold them without disintegrating or dissolving.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn 1961, Osamu Shimomura extracted green fluorescent protein (GFP) and another bioluminescent protein, called aequorin, from the large and abundant hydromedusa Aequorea victoria, while studying photoproteins that cause bioluminescence in this species. Three decades later, Douglas Prasher sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP. Martin Chalfie figured out how to use GFP as a fluorescent marker of genes inserted into other cells or organisms. Roger Tsien later chemically manipulated GFP to produce other fluorescent colors to use as markers. In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfie and Tsien won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work with GFP.\\r\\nMan-made GFP became commonly used as a fluorescent tag to show which cells or tissues express specific genes. The genetic engineering technique fuses the gene of interest to the GFP gene. The fused DNA is then put into a cell, to generate either a cell line or (via IVF techniques) an entire animal bearing the gene. In the cell or animal, the artificial gene turns on in the same tissues and the same time as the normal gene, making GFP instead of the normal protein. Illuminating the animal or cell reveals what tissues express that proteinor at what stage of development. The fluorescence shows where the gene is expressed.[88]\\r\\nJellyfish are displayed in many public aquariums. Often the tank's background is blue and the animals are illuminated by side light, increasing the contrast between the animal and the background. In natural conditions, many jellies are so transparent that they are nearly invisible.\\r\\nJellyfish are not adapted to closed spaces. They depend on currents to transport them from place to place. Professional exhibits feature precise water flows, typically in circular tanks to avoid trapping specimens in corners. The Monterey Bay Aquarium uses a modified version of the kreisel (German for \\"spinning top\\") for this purpose. The outflow is spread out over a large surface area and the inflow enters as a sheet of water in front of the outflow, so the jellyfish do not get sucked into it.[89] As of 2009, jellyfish were becoming popular in home aquariums.[90][91][92][93] These home aquariums generate this special water flow pattern using an air-lift pump[94] and require special food for the jellyfish, which can be shipped from suppliers to their final destination.\\r\\nJellyfish sting their prey using nematocysts, also called cnidocysts, stinging structures located in specialized cells called cnidocytes, which are characteristic of all Cnidaria. Contact with a jellyfish tentacle can trigger millions of nematocysts to pierce the skin and inject venom,[95] yet only some species' venom cause an adverse reaction in humans. When a nematocyst is triggered by contact by predator or prey, pressure builds up rapidly inside it up to 2,000 pounds per square inch (14,000?kPa) until it bursts. A lance inside the nematocyst pierces the victim's skin, and venom flows through into the victim.[96] Touching or being touched by a jellyfish can be very uncomfortable, sometimes requiring medical assistance; sting effects range from no effect to extreme pain to death. Even beached and dying jellyfish can still sting when touched.\\r\\nScyphozoan jellyfish stings range from a twinge to tingling to agony.[97] Most jellyfish stings are not deadly, but stings of some species of the class Cubozoa and the Box jellyfish, such as the famous and especially toxic Irukandji jellyfish, can be deadly. Stings may cause anaphylaxis, which can be fatal. Medical care may include administration of an antivenom.\\r\\nIn 2010, at a New Hampshire beach, pieces of a single dead lion's mane jellyfish stung between 125 and 150 people.[98][99] Jellyfish kill 20 to 40 people a year in the Philippines alone.[97] In 2006 the Spanish Red Cross treated 19,000 stung swimmers along the Costa Brava.[97]\\r\\nThe sea wasp, a box jellyfish found in Australian waters, and more recently, Florida,[100] can kill an adult human within a few minutes. A thin skin covering such as pantyhose was found to be sufficient protection. The pantyhose were formerly thought to work because of the length of the nematocysts, but it is now known to be related to the way the stinger cells work. The stinging cells on a box jellyfish's tentacles are not triggered by pressure. Instead, they are triggered by the chemicals found on skin. Pantyhose hinders the detection of the chemicals preventing the nematocysts from firing.[101]\\r\\nThe three goals of first aid for uncomplicated stings are to prevent injury to rescuers, deactivate the nematocysts, and remove tentacles attached to the patient. Rescuers usually wear barrier clothing, such as pantyhose, wet suits or full-body sting-proof suits while removing jellies or tentacles from injured. Deactivating the nematocysts (stinging cells) prevents further injection of venom.\\r\\nVinegar (3ÿ10% aqueous acetic acid) may be used as a common remedy to help with box jellyfish stings,[102][103] but not the stings of the Portuguese man o' war (which is not a true jellyfish, but a siphonophore).[102] For stings on or around the eyes, a towel dampened with vinegar may be used to dab around the eyes, with care taken to avoid the eyeballs. Salt water may be used as an alternative if vinegar is unavailable;[102][104] and may be preferred over vinegar.[105] Fresh water is not usually used if the sting occurs in salt water, as changes in tonicity[106] can release additional venom. Rubbing wounds, or using alcohol, spirits, ammonia, or urine may have strongly negative effects as these can encourage the release of venom.[107]\\r\\nClearing the area of jelly, tentacles, and wetness further reduces nematocyst firing.[107] Scraping the affected skin with a knife edge, safety razor, or credit card may remove remaining nematocysts.[108]\\r\\nBeyond initial first aid, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may control skin irritation (pruritus).[108] Ice or fresh water is not usually applied to stings, since they may cause nematocysts to continue to release toxin.[109][110] Immunobased antivenins have been available since the 1970s;[111] administration requires medical personnel and refrigeration and are used in extreme cases as with regard to the box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri.[112]\\r\\nJellyfish adversely affect humanity by interfering with public systems and harming swimmers.[97] The most obvious consequences are human injury or death and reduced coastal tourism. Jellies destroy fish nets, poison or crush captured fish, and consume fish eggs and young fish.[113] The most venomous jellyfish is the box jellyfish which produces enough poison to kill 60 humans and is the reason for 1 death per year.[114]\\r\\nJellyfish can clog cooling equipment, disabling power plants in several countries. Jellyfish caused a cascading blackout in the Philippines in 1999,[97] as well as damaging the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California in 2008.[115] Clogging can stop desalination plants, as well as clogging ship engines[113] and infesting fishing nets.[116]","input":"What kind of water do jellyfish live in?"},{"output":"September 2009","context":"","input":"When did television started broadcasting 24 hours a day?"},{"output":"October 13, 1792","context":"The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800. The term White House is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers, as in \\"The White House announced that...\\".\\r\\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban[2] in the Neoclassical style. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800 using Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.[3] In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico in 1829.\\r\\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\\r\\nThe modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildingthe former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice Presidentand Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six storiesthe Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second[4] on the American Institute of Architects list of \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two executive mansions in New York City: the Samuel Osgood House at 3 Cherry Street (April 1789?ÿ February 1790), and the Alexander Macomb House at 39ÿ41 Broadway (FebruaryÿAugust 1790). In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790.\\r\\nThe July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524ÿ30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it.\\r\\nPresident John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On Saturday,[5] November 1, 1800,[6] he became the first president to occupy the White House. The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania.\\r\\nFirst Presidential Mansion: Samuel Osgood House, Manhattan, New York.

Built to be the permanent presidential mansion, Congress moved the national capital to Philadelphia before its completion.\\r\\nHouse intended for the President, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1790s). Built to be the permanent presidential mansion, neither Washington nor Adams would occupy it.\\r\\nThe President's House was a major feature of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's' plan for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C. (see: L'Enfant Plan).[7][8] The architect of the White House was chosen in a design competition which received nine proposals, including one submitted anonymously by Thomas Jefferson.[9]\\r\\nPresident Washington visited Charleston, South Carolina in May 1791 on his \\"Southern Tour\\", and saw the under-construction Charleston County Courthouse designed by Irish architect James Hoban. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then. The following year, he summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.[10]\\r\\nOn July 16, 1792, the President met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.[11]\\r\\nWashington was not entirely pleased with the original submission, however; he found it too small, lacking ornament, and not monumental enough to house the nation's president. On his recommendation, the house was changed from three stories to two, and was widened from a nine-bay facade to an 11-bay facade. Hoban's competition drawings do not survive.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe building has classical inspiration sources, that could be found directly or indirectly in the Roman architect Vitruvius or in Andrea Palladio styles; Palladio being an Italian architect of the Renaissance which had a considerable influence on the Western architecture (Palladian architecture). The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of Leinster House, in Dublin, which later became the seat of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament).[12] Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present Blue Room. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in White House Historical Association publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and Chateau de Rastignac, a neoclassical country house located in La Bachellerie in the Dordogne region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the French Revolution for twenty years and then finally built 1812ÿ1817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).[13] The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that Thomas Jefferson, during his tour of Bordeaux in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the cole Spciale d'Architecture (Bordeaux Architectural College).[14] On his return to the U.S. he then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and Benjamin Henry Latrobe.[13]\\r\\nConstruction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.[15] The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by enslaved and free African-American laborers, as well as employed Europeans.[16] Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by Scottish immigrants, employed by Hoban,[17] as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the \\"fish scale\\" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to $3,279,177 today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.[18]\\r\\nShortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant for a \\"palace\\" that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.[17] The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa?ades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were whitewashed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.[17]\\r\\nAs it is a famed structure in America, several replicas of the White House have been constructed.\\r\\nThe north front is the principal fa?ade of the White House and consists of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet, thus the fa?ade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a prostyle portico (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a porte cochere. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the center of the portico is surmounted by a lunette fanlight. Above the entrance is a sculpted floral festoon. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet.\\r\\nThe mansion's southern fa?ade is a combination of the Palladian and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is rusticated in the Palladian fashion. At the center of the fa?ade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north fa?ade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor double staircase leading to an Ionic colonnaded loggia (with the Truman Balcony at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa?ade.\\r\\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the \\"President's Palace\\", \\"Presidential Mansion\\", or \\"President's House\\".[19] The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \\"White House\\" was recorded in 1811.[20] A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the Burning of Washington, white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered,[21] giving the building its namesake hue.[22] The name \\"Executive Mansion\\" was used in official contexts until President Theodore Roosevelt established the formal name by having \\"White HouseÿWashington\\" engraved on the stationery in 1901.[23][24] The current letterhead wording and arrangement \\"The White House\\" with the word \\"Washington\\" centered beneath goes back to the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[24]\\r\\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the President of the United States may have derived from Martha Washington's home, White House Plantation in Virginia, where the nation's first President had courted the First Lady in the mid-18th century.[25]\\r\\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building.[17] During Adams' second day in the house, he wrote a letter to his wife Abigail, containing a prayer for the house. Adams wrote:\\r\\nI pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.[26]\\r\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.[26]\\r\\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before Thomas Jefferson moved into the \\"pleasant country residence\\"[27] in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\\"[28]), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With Benjamin Henry Latrobe, he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.[17] Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.[17]\\r\\nIn 1814, during the War of 1812, the White House was set ablaze by British troops[29] during the Burning of Washington, in retaliation for burning Upper Canada's Parliament Buildings in the Battle of York; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,[29] and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by HMS Fantome sank en route to Halifax off Prospect during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,[30][31] even though Fantome had no involvement in that action.[32]\\r\\nAfter the fire, President James Madison resided in The Octagon House from 1814 to 1815, and then the Seven Buildings from 1815 to the end of his term.[33] Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south portico was constructed in 1824 during the James Monroe administration; the north portico was built six years later.[17] Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.[34] An elliptical portico at Chateau de Rastignac in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,[35] although this matter is one of great debate.[36] Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the U.S. Capitol, carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the Viceregal Lodge (now ras an Uachtarin, residence of the President of Ireland), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.[35] For the North Portico, a variation on the Ionic Order was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\\r\\nThe White House as it looked following the conflagration of August 24, 1814\\r\\nJefferson and Latrobe's West Wing Colonnade in this nineteenth-century engraved view, is now the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.\\r\\nPrincipal story plan for the white house by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, 1807.\\r\\nEarliest known photograph of the White House, taken c. 1846 by John Plumbe during the administration of James K. Polk.\\r\\nBy the time of the American Civil War, the White House had become overcrowded. The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions.[37] Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at Meridian Hill in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.[37]\\r\\nWhen Chester Arthur took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed Lucretia Garfield moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. Louis Comfort Tiffany was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a public auction.[38] All that was saved were bust portraits of John Adams and Martin Van Buren.[39] A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\\r\\nIn the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of gold leaf, and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful traceries woven to spell \\"USA\\". The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled Tiffany glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.[40][41]\\r\\nIn 1891, First Lady Caroline Harrison proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.[37] A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.[37] These plans were ultimately rejected.\\r\\nHowever, in 1902 Theodore Roosevelt hired McKim, Mead & White to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building's architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions.[42][43] Charles McKim himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the President's large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.[17]\\r\\nPresident William Howard Taft enlisted the help of architect Nathan C. Wyeth to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the Oval Office.[37] In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time.[44] The West Wing was damaged by fire in 1929, but rebuilt during the remaining years of the Herbert Hoover presidency. In the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the Rose Garden.[17]\\r\\nDecades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S. Truman[45] took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame.[17] By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951.[46] The work, done by the firm of Philadelphia contractor John McShain, required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure.[45] The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7 million (US$ 53 million in 2017).[47] Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall.[45] Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter.[17] The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952.[17] While the house's structure was kept intact by the Truman reconstruction, much of the new interior finishes were generic, and of little historic value. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814ÿ1816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling; the walls of the Vermeil Room, Library, China Room, and Map Room on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.[48]\\r\\nJacqueline Kennedy, wife of President John F. Kennedy (1961ÿ63), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house. She enlisted the help of Henry Francis du Pont of the Winterthur Museum to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.[49] Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the Crowninshield family, Jane Engelhard, Jayne Wrightsman, and the Oppenheimer family. Stphane Boudin of the House of Jansen, a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Mrs. Kennedy to assist with the decoration.[49] Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the Green Room, French Empire for the Blue Room, American Empire for the Red Room, Louis XVI for the Yellow Oval Room, and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the Treaty Room. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.[49] In the Diplomatic Reception Room, Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \\"Vue de l'Amrique Nord\\" wall paper which Zuber & Cie had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\\r\\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy.[50] Sale of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\\r\\nKennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public in a televised tour of the house on Valentine's Day in 1962.[51]\\r\\nCongress enacted legislation in September 1961 declaring the White House a museum. Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the President. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the Smithsonian Institution for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.[52]\\r\\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.[53] Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the Committee for the Preservation of the White House must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Familyusually represented by the First Lady, the White House Curator, and the Chief Usherto implement the family's proposals for altering the house.[54]\\r\\nDuring the Nixon administration (1969ÿ74), First Lady Pat Nixon refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President Richard Nixon.[55] Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.[56] Her husband created the modern press briefing room over Franklin Roosevelt's old swimming pool.[57] Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.[58]\\r\\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.[59] A Carter-era innovation, a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan's presidency.[60][61] Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years.[62] The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.[62]\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton refurbished some rooms with the assistance of Arkansas decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, State Dining Room, Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.[63] During the administration of George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, Cabinet Room, and theater were also refurbished.[63]\\r\\nThe White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair because of his paralytic illness. In the 1990s, Hillary Clinton, at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy wheelchair access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\\r\\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters.[61] These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. 167 solar photovoltaic grid tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter. The story was picked up by industry trade journals.[64] In 2013, President Barack Obama had a set of solar panels installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power would be used for the president's living quarters.[65][66]\\r\\nThe president usually travels to and from the White House grounds via official motorcade or helicopter. The journey by helicopter was inaugurated in the 1950s, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower began traveling on Marine One to and from his official residence.[67]\\r\\nToday the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central Executive Residence flanked by the East Wing and West Wing. The Chief Usher coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes: six stories and 55,000?ft2 (5,100 m2) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, twenty-eight fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley (officially called the Harry S. Truman Bowling Alley), a movie theater (officially called the White House Family Theater[68]), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green.[24] It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.[69]\\r\\nThe original residence is in the center. Two colonnadesone on the east and one on the westdesigned by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings, added later. The Executive Residence houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase.[70] The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, Vermeil Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices.[71] The second floor family residence includes the Yellow Oval Room, East and West Sitting Halls, the White House Master Bedroom, President's Dining Room, the Treaty Room, Lincoln Bedroom and Queens' Bedroom, as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.[72] The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).[73]\\r\\nThe West Wing houses the President's office (the Oval Office) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the Cabinet Room, where the president conducts business meetings and where the Cabinet meets,[74] as well as the White House Situation Room, James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, and Roosevelt Room.[75] In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding fiber optic cables and LCD screens for the display of charts and graphs.[76] The makeover took 11 months and cost $8 million, of which news outlets paid $2 million.[76] In September 2010, a two-year project began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure;[77] this will be followed with additional renovation of the wing.[78]\\r\\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a sound stage and used as the setting for the popular television show The West Wing.[79]\\r\\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the First Lady, and the White House Social Office. Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \\"Office of the First Lady\\". The East Wing was built during World War II in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.\\r\\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers firm, commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the White House Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old American Elm (Ulmus americana L.) tree on the north side of the building, came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora) planted by Andrew Jackson. Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[80]\\r\\nThe Cross Hall, connecting the State Dining Room and the East Room on the State Floor\\r\\nMarine One prepares for landing on the South Lawn where State Arrival Ceremonies for visiting heads of state take place.\\r\\nYellow Oval Room in the private, second-floor family residence centered directly above the Blue Room\\r\\nThe White House and surrounding grounds\\r\\nThe White House with fountain and grounds\\r\\nWhite House from the north\\r\\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.\\r\\nThe White House remained accessible in other ways; President Abraham Lincoln complained that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like \\"General\\" Daniel Pratt, as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn February 1974, a stolen army helicopter landed without authorization on the White House's grounds.[81] Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane crashed on the White House grounds, and the pilot died instantly.[82]\\r\\nAs a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in May 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.[83]\\r\\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, the United States Secret Service closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the Treasury Building.\\r\\nAfter September 11, 2001, this was made permanent in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and the Ellipse.[84] In response to the Boston Marathon bombing the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\\r\\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closing has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.[85]\\r\\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the Old Executive Office Building to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the September 11 attacks. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public.[86] White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after sequestration.[87] The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.[88]\\r\\nThe White House Complex is protected by the United States Secret Service and the United States Park Police.\\r\\nNASAMS (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all air space around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.[89][90]\\r\\nFor security reasons, the section of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House is closed to all vehicular traffic, except government officials.\\r\\nWhite House at night\\r\\nNorth front of the White House on the reverse (back) of the U.S. $20 bill.","input":"When did the construction of the white house begin?"},{"output":"October 21, 1917","context":"Western Front\\r\\nItalian Front\\r\\nThe American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was the expeditionary force of the United States Army during World War I. It was established on July 5, 1917, in France under the command of General John J. Pershing. During the United States campaigns in World War I it fought alongside the French Army, British Army, Canadian Army and Australian Army on the Western Front, against the German Empire. A minority of the AEF troops also fought alongside the Italian Army in that same year, against the Austro-Hungarian Army. The AEF helped the French Army on the Western Front during the Aisne Offensive (at the Battle of Chateau-Thierry (1918) and Battle of Belleau Wood) in the summer of 1918, and the AEF fought its major actions in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in the latter part of 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Woodrow Wilson initially planned to give command of the AEF to Gen. Frederick Funston, but after Funston's sudden death, Wilson appointed Major General John J. \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing in May 1917, and Pershing remained in command for the entire war. Pershing insisted that American soldiers be well-trained before going to Europe. As a result, few troops arrived before January 1918. In addition, Pershing insisted that the American force would not be used merely to fill gaps in the French and British armies, and he resisted European efforts to have U.S. troops deployed as individual replacements in decimated Allied units. This approach was not always well received by the western Allied leaders who distrusted the potential of an army lacking experience in large-scale warfare.[1] In addition, the British Empire tried to bargain with its spare shipping to make the United States put its soldiers into British ranks.\\r\\nBy June 1917, only 14,000 American soldiers had arrived in France, and the AEF had only a minor participation at the front through late October 1917, but by May 1918 over one million American troops were stationed in France, though only half of them made it to the front lines.[2] Since the transport ships needed to bring American troops to Europe were scarce at the beginning, the U.S. Army pressed into service passenger liners, seized German ships, and borrowed Allied ships to transport American soldiers from ports in New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia. The mobilization effort taxed the American military to the limit and required new organizational strategies and command structures to transport great numbers of troops and supplies quickly and efficiently. The French harbors of Bordeaux, La Pallice, Saint Nazaire, and Brest became the entry points into the French railway system that brought the American troops and their supplies to the Western Front. American engineers in France also built 82 new ship berths, nearly 1,000 miles (1,600?km) of additional standard-gauge tracks, and over 100,000 miles (160,000?km) of telephone and telegraph lines.[1]\\r\\nThe first American troops, who were often called \\"Doughboys\\", landed in Europe in June 1917. However the AEF did not participate at the front until October 21, 1917, when the 1st Division fired the first American shell of the war toward German lines, although they participated only on a small scale. A group of regular soldiers and the first American division to arrive in France, entered the trenches near Nancy, France, in Lorraine.[1]\\r\\nThe AEF used French and British equipment. Particularly appreciated were the French canon de 75 modle 1897, the canon de 155 C modle 1917 Schneider, and the canon de 155mm GPF. American aviation units received the SPAD XIII and Nieuport 28 fighters, and the U.S. Army tank corps used French Renault FT light tanks. Pershing established facilities in France to train new arrivals with their new weapons.[3] By the end of 1917, four divisions were deployed in a large training area near Verdun: the 1st Division, a regular army formation; the 26th Division, a National Guard division; the 2nd Division, a combination of regular troops and U.S. Marines; and the 42nd \\"Rainbow\\" Division, a National Guard division made up of soldiers from nearly every state in the United States. The fifth division, the 41st Division, was converted into a depot division near Tours.\\r\\nAt the beginning, during the Spring of 1918, the four battle-ready U.S. divisions were deployed under French and British command to gain combat experience by defending relatively quiet sectors of their lines. After the first offensive action and American-led AEF victory on 28 May 1918 at the Battle of Cantigny,[5] by the U.S. 1st Division, and a similar local action by the 2nd Division at Belleau Wood beginning 6 June, both while assigned under French Corps command, Pershing worked towards the deployment of an independent US field Army. The rest followed at an accelerating pace during the spring and summer of 1918. By June Americans were arriving in-theater at the rate of 10,000 a day; most of which entered training by British, Canadian and Australian battle-experienced officers and senior non-commissioned ranks. The training took a minimum of six weeks due to the inexperience of the servicemen.\\r\\nThe first offensive action by AEF units serving under non-American command was 1,000 men (four companies from the 33d Division AEF), with the Australian Corps during the Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918. (Corporal Thomas A. Pope was awarded the Medal of Honor for this battle.) This battle took place under the overall command of the Australian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir John Monash. The Allied force in this battle combined artillery, armor, infantry, and air support (Combined arms), which served as a blueprint for all subsequent Allied attacks, using \\"tanks\\".[6]\\r\\nU.S. Army and Marine Corps troops played a key role in helping stop the German thrust towards Paris, during the Second Battle of the Marne in June 1918 (at the Battle of Chateau-Thierry (1918) and the Battle of Belleau Wood). The first major and distinctly American offensive was the reduction of the Saint Mihiel salient during September 1918. During the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, Pershing commanded the U.S. First Army, composed of seven divisions and more than 500,000 men, in the largest offensive operation ever undertaken by United States armed forces. This successful offensive was followed by the Meuse-Argonne offensive, lasting from September 26 to November 11, 1918, during which Pershing commanded more than one million American and French combatants. In these two military operations, Allied forces recovered more than 200?sq mi (488?km2) of French territory from the German army. By the time the World War I Armistice had suspended all combat on November 11, 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces had evolved into a modern, combat-tested army.[1]\\r\\nLate in the war, American units ultimately fought in two other theaters at the request of the European powers. Pershing sent troops of the 332d Infantry Regiment to Italy, and President Wilson agreed to send some troops, the 27th and 339th Infantry Regiments, to Russia.[7] These latter two were known as the American Expeditionary Force Siberia,[8] and the American Expeditionary Force North Russia.[9]\\r\\nThe AEF sustained about 320,000 casualties: 53,402 battle deaths, 63,114 noncombat deaths and 204,000 wounded.[10]\\r\\nThe influenza pandemic during the fall of 1918 took the lives of more than 25,000 men from the AEF, while another 360,000 became gravely ill. Some other diseases were relatively well controlled through compulsory vaccination. Typhoid fever was also practically eliminated. Relatively few men suffered actual injury from poison gas, although much larger numbers mistakenly thought that they had been exposed.[7]\\r\\nUsing questionnaires filled out by doughboys as they left the Army, Gutirrez reports that they were not cynical or disillusioned. They fought \\"for honor, manhood, comrades, and adventure, but especially for duty.\\"[11]\\r\\nAfrican Americans were drafted on the same basis as whites and made up 13 percent of the draftees. By the end of the war, over 350,000 African-Americans had served in AEF units on the Western Front.[12] However, they were assigned to segregated units commanded by white officers. One fifth of the black soldiers sent to France saw combat, compared to two-thirds of the whites. They were three percent of AEF combat forces, and under two percent of battlefield fatalities.[13] \\"The mass of the colored drafted men cannot be used for combatant troops\\", said a General Staff report in 1918, and it recommended that \\"these colored drafted men be organized in reserve labor battalions.\\" They handled unskilled labor tasks as stevedores in the Atlantic ports and common laborers at the camps and in the Services of the Rear in France.[14] The French, whose front-line troops were resisting combat duties to the point of mutiny, requested and received control of several regiments of black combat troops.[15] Kennedy reports \\"Units of the black 92nd Division particularly suffered from poor preparation and the breakdown in command control. As the only black combat division, the 92nd Division entered the line with unique liabilities. It had been deliberately dispersed throughout several camps during its stateside training; some of its artillery units were summoned to France before they had completed their courses of instruction, and were never fully-equipped until after the Armistice; nearly all its senior white officers scorned the men under their command and repeatedly asked to be transferred. The black enlisted men were frequently diverted from their already attenuated training opportunities in France in the summer of 1918 and put to work as stevedores and common laborers.\\"[16]\\r\\nThe 369th, 370th, 371st, and 372d Infantry Regiments (nominally the 93d Division, but never consolidated as such) served with distinction under French command with French colonial units in front-line combat. The French did not harbor the same levels of disdain based on skin color and for many Americans of an African-American descent it was a liberating and refreshing experience.[citation needed] These African-American soldiers wore American uniforms, some dating from the time of the Union Army, with French helmets and were armed with French Model 1907/15 8mm Lebel Berthier rifle, and Fusil Mle 1907/15 manufactured by Remington Arms rather than the M1903 Springfield or M1917 Enfield rifles issued to most American soldiers.[17] One of the most distinguished units was the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters. The 369th was on the front lines for six months, longer than any other African-American regiment in the war. One hundred seventy-one members of the 369th were awarded the Legion of Merit.[18] One member of the 369th, Sergeant Henry Johnson, was awarded the French Croix de guerre,[19] and posthumously the Medal of Honor.[20]","input":"When did american troops first fight in ww1?"},{"output":"allowed farmers to plant more crops and therefore to increase production","context":"The three-field system is a regime of crop rotation that was used in medieval and early-modern Europe. Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. Under this system, the arable land of an estate or village was divided into three large fields: one was planted in the autumn with winter wheat or rye; the second field was planted with other crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third was left fallow, in order to allow the soil of that field to regain its nutrients. With each rotation, the field would be used differently, so that a field would be planted for two out of the three years used, whilst one year it \\"rested\\". Previously a \\"two field system\\" had been in place, with half the land being left fallow. The three field system allowed farmers to plant more crops and therefore to increase production and legumes have the ability to fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. With more crops available to sell, this also helped the economy in general to thrive.[1]\\r\\nThe three field system required more plowing of land and its introduction coincided with the adoption of the moldboard plow. These parallel developments worked hand in hand to increase the productivity of the land. The legume crop needed summer rain to succeed, and so the three-field system was less successful around the Mediterranean. Oats for horse food could also be planted in the spring, which, combined with the adoption of horse collars and horseshoes, led to the replacement of oxen by horses for many farming tasks, with a concomitant increase in agricultural productivity and the nutrition available to the population.[2]\\r\\nOne of the first Germans to question this system, and new ways of expanding beyond this medieval system was Johann Friedrich Mayer, in his 1769 work Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen.[3]","input":"What was the purpose of the three-field system?"},{"output":"327,589,916","context":"The United States is estimated to have a population of 327,589,916 as of April 23, 2018, making it the third most populous country in the world.[3] It is very urbanized, with 81% residing in cities and suburbs as of 2014 (the worldwide urban rate is 54%).[4] California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward.[5][6] New York City is the most populous city in the United States.[7]\\r\\nThe total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2016 is 1.82 children per woman,[8][9] which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1.

Note Denver and Baltimore have over 2.5 million residents in their metro areas.\\r\\nThe United States Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The Census Bureaus uses five racial classifications that are defined as indicated below. State classifications of race may differ from federal classifications.[50]\\r\\nData about race and ethnicity are self-reported to the Census Bureau. Since the 2000 census, Congress has authorised people to identify themselves according to more than one racial classification by selecting more than one category. One only ethnicity may be selected, however, because the U.S. Census recognises only two ethnicities -- Hispanic and Non-Hispanic -- which, obviously, are mutually exclusive; so you can be one or the other, but not both. The Census Bureau defines \\"Hispanic\\" as any person who has an ancestral connection to Spain.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010ÿ2015 American Community Survey, the racial composition of the United States in 2015 was:[51]\\r\\nThe U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican , South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. People who identify with the terms Hispanic or Latino are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the decennial census questionnaire and various Census Bureau survey questionnaires ÿ Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano or Puerto Rican or Cuban ÿ as well as those who indicate that they are another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.[52] People who identify their origin as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.[50]\\r\\nThere were 22.1 million veterans in 2009,[53] meaning that less than 10% of Americans served in the Armed Forces.[54]\\r\\nIn 2010, The Washington Post estimated that there were 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.[55]\\r\\nThere were about 2 million people in prison in 2010.[56]\\r\\nThe 2000 U.S. Census counted same-sex couples in an oblique way; asking the sex and the relationship to the \\"main householder\\", whose sex was also asked. One organization specializing in analyzing gay demographic data reported, based on this count in the 2000 census and in the 2000 supplementary survey, that same-sex couples comprised between 0.99% and 1.13% of U.S. couples in 2000.[57] A 2006 report issued by The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation concluded that the number of same-sex couples in the U.S. grew from 2000 to 2005, from nearly 600,000 couples in 2000 to almost 777,000 in 2005. A 2006 UCLA study reported that 4.1% of Americans aged 18ÿ45 identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.[58]\\r\\nA 2011 report by the Institute estimated that 4 million adults identify as gay or lesbian, representing 1.7% of the population over 18. A spokesperson said that, until recently, few studies have tried to eliminate people who had occasionally undertaken homosexual behavior or entertained homosexual thoughts, from people who identified as lesbian or gay.[59] (Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation for a list of studies.) The American Community Survey from the 2000 U.S. Census estimated 776,943 same-sex couple households in the country as a whole, representing about 0.5% of the population.[58]\\r\\nA report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%.[61] At the same time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2042, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[62]\\r\\nThe report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16% today to 30% by 2050, the Black percentage barely rising from 12.9% to 13.1%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to 7.8%. The United States had a population of 310 million people in October 2010, and is projected to reach 400 million by 2039 and 439 million in 2050.[20][63][64][65] It is further projected that 82% of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to immigrants and their children.[66]\\r\\nOf the nation's children in 2050, 62% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 44% today. Approximately 39% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008).[67] Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of American children under 5 years old in 2015.[68]\\r\\nIn 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau projected the future censuses as follows:[20]\\r\\nThe table below is based mainly on selected data as reported to the United States Census Bureau. It only includes the voluntary self-reported membership of religious bodies with 750,000 or more. The definition of a member is determined by each religious body.[69] In 2004[update], the US census bureau reported that about 13% of the population did not identify themselves as a member of any religion.[70][clarification needed]\\r\\nIn a Pew Research Survey performed in 2012, Americans without a religion (atheists, agnostics, nothing in particular, etc.) surpassed Evangelical Protestant Americans with almost 20% of Americans being nonreligious. If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion.[71]\\r\\nA survey conducted in 2014 by the same organization indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion rose to nearly 23% of the population, up from 16% in 2007.[72]\\r\\nReligious affiliation within each state that has the largest deviation compared to the national average, 2001.\\r\\nPercentage of state populations that identify with a religion rather than \\"no religion\\", 2001.\\r\\nPlurality religion by state, 2001. Data is unavailable for Alaska and Hawaii.\\r\\nThe United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.\\r\\nAdult respondents were asked the open-ended question, \\"What is your religion, if any?\\". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \\"Protestant\\" or \\"Christian\\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.\\r\\nReligious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008[79]\\r\\nFigures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \\"no religion\\" than any other group.\\r\\nIn 2010, the median age for marriage for men was 27; for women, 26.[80]\\r\\nIn 2006, the median household income in the United States was around $46,326. Household and personal income depends on variables such as race, number of income earners, educational attainment and marital status.\\r\\nSocial classes in the United States lack distinct boundaries and may overlap. Even their existence (when distinguished from economic strata) is controversial. The following table provides a summary of some prominent academic theories on the stratification of American society:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the average man weighed 194.7 pounds (88.3?kg); the average woman 164.7 pounds (74.7?kg).[81][unreliable source?] The height of an American man was 5?feet 9?inches (1.75?m)[82][unreliable source?] and woman 5?feet 3.8?inches (1.621?m)[83][unreliable source?] The average BMI is 27.3 for males (overweight) and 28.5 for females (overweight).[84][unreliable source?]\\r\\nAccording to a Gallup poll in 2012, an estimated 26% of the population were obese,[85] 21% smoked,[86] and 11% had diabetes.[87]\\r\\nA nationwide study reported by The New York Times in 2010 indicated that 19.5% of teens, aged 12ÿ19, had developed \\"slight\\" hearing loss. \\"Slight\\" was defined as an inability to hear at 16 to 24 decibels.[88]\\r\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control in 2011, an estimated 1.2 million people were living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.[89]\\r\\nA study by William Strauss and Neil Howe, in their books Generations and Fourth Turning, looked at generational similarities and differences going back to the 15th century and concluded that over 80-year spans, generations proceed through four stages of about 20 years each.\\r\\nA definitive recent study of US generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages was asked, \\"What world events are especially important to you?\\"[90] They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident.\\r\\nToday the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts:\\r\\nSubdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as \\"pre-peak\\" (including peak year) and \\"post-peak\\". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \\"bust\\", there are still a relatively large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.[97]\\r\\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[98]\\r\\nMedian ages are 37.3 years; males are 36.1 years; females are 38.5 years estimated as of 2012.\\r\\nAs of 2012, people are distributed by age as follows:\\r\\nThe growth rate is 0.76% as estimated from 2014ÿ2010 by the U.S. Census\\r\\nThe birth rate is 12.5 births/1,000 population, estimated as of 2013. This was the lowest since records began. There were 3,957,577 births in 2013.[99]\\r\\nIn 2009, Time magazine reported that 40% of births were to unmarried women.[101] The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17% Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics, 66% Native Americans, and 72% Black American.[102]\\r\\nThe drop in the birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be associated with the Late-2000s recession.[103]\\r\\nA study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and 2011 were male.[104]\\r\\nPer U.S. federal government data released in March 2011, births fell 4% from 2007 to 2009, the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s.[105] Births have declined for three consecutive years, and are now 7% below the peak in 2007.[106] This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011.[107] Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions.[108] This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly stems from the fact that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s.[109] Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history.[110] In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007.[110] The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009.[110] Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations.[110] Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.[111]\\r\\nNote: Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.[112][9] Also note that growth arrows indicate an increase or decrease in the number of births, not in the fertility rate.\\r\\nNOTE:\\r\\nAs of July 2010, it was estimated that there were 8.18 deaths/1,000 population per year.[114] In 2015 it was 8.44/1,000 population/year.[115]\\r\\n13% of the population was foreign-born in 2009 ÿ a rise of 350% since 1970 when foreign-born people accounted for 3.7% of the population,[116] including 11.2 million illegal immigrants,[117] 80% of whom come from Latin America.[118] Latin America is the largest region-of-birth group, accounting for over half (53%) of all foreign born population in US,[119] and thus is also the largest source of both legal and illegal immigration to US.[120] In 2011, there are 18.1 million naturalized citizens in the United States, accounting for 45% of the foreign-born population (40.4 million) and 6% of the total US population at the time,[121] and around 680,000 legal immigrants are naturalized annually.[122]\\r\\n4.32 people migrate per 1,000 population, estimated in 2010.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of 2010:\\r\\nAs of 2010:\\r\\nAs of 2010:\\r\\nAs of 2016:\\r\\nAs of July?2017[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.3 percent (U3 rate).[126]\\r\\nAs of July?2016[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.9 percent (U3 rate).[126]\\r\\nAs of July?2015[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.3 percent (U3 rate).[127]\\r\\nAs of July?2014[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 6.2 percent (U3 rate).[126]\\r\\nThe U6 unemployment rate as of April?2017[update] was 8.6 percent.[128] The U6 unemployment rate counts not only people without work seeking full-time employment (the more familiar U3 rate), but also counts \\"marginally attached workers and those working part-time for economic reasons.\\" Note that some of these part-time workers counted as employed by U3 could be working as little as an hour a week. And the \\"marginally attached workers\\" include those who have gotten discouraged and stopped looking, but still want to work. The age considered for this calculation is 16 years and over.[129]\\r\\nIn 2013, about 15% of Americans moved.[citation needed] Most of these, 67%, moved within the same county. Of the 33% who moved beyond local county boundaries, 13% of those moved more than 200 miles (320?km).[130]\\r\\nLists:\\r\\nIncome:\\r\\nPopulation:","input":"What is the population in the usa 2018?"},{"output":"Haiti","context":"A member state of the Caribbean Community is a state that has been specified as a member state within the Treaty of Chaguaramas or any other Caribbean state that is in the opinion of the Conference, able and willing to exercise the rights and assume the obligations of membership in accordance with article 29 of the Treaty of Chaguaramas. Member states are designated as either More economically developed country (MDCs) or Less economically developed countries (LDCs). These designations are not intended to create disparity among member states.[1] The Community was established by mainly English- (and English Creole) speaking Caribbean countries, but has since become a multilingual organisation in practice with the addition of Dutch-speaking Suriname on 4 July 1995 and French and Haitian Creole speaking Haiti on 2 July 2002. As of 4 July 2002 there are fifteen full members of the Caribbean Community, four of which are founding members.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1999, Anguilla once again became involved with CARICOM when it gained associate membership. Before this, Anguilla had briefly been a part of CARICOM (1974ÿ1980) as a constituent of the full member state of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla.\\r\\nThe Bahamas had begun participating in the regional cooperation and integration movement when it began attending the Heads of Government Conferences of the Commonwealth Caribbean in 1966. This practice continued even after the establishment of CARIFTA, of which The Bahamas was never a member, with The Bahamas being involved in educational cooperation and Committees established to deepen financial cooperation among CARIFTA states and the Bahamas and to transform CARIFTA into the Caribbean Community. In particular, The Bahamas was even included in a Committee of Attorneys-General tasked with examining the legal implications of forming the Caribbean Community and to draw up a draft Treaty for its formation. In April 1973, at the final meeting of the commonwealth Caribbean Heads of Government before the establishment of the Caribbean Community, the Conference welcomed the upcoming independence of The Bahamas in July 1973 and looked forward to its participation in the Caribbean Community.[2] In late 1974, the Bahamas (as well as Haiti and Suriname) indicated that it would like to join the Community.[3] Bahamian involvement with the Caribbean Community and regional integration continued in the same form after independence and the establishment of CARICOM as had occurred since 1966, with The Bahamas attending the second meeting of the CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in 1975 and being involved in the setting up of a special Inter-Governmental Committee on university education.[4] In fact, the original Treaty of Chaguaramas (In Chapter I, Article 2) provided for The Bahamas to automatically join the Caribbean Community and Common Market upon application,[5] with the Bahamas being listed alongside the actual member states as being a state to which membership of the Community may be open to.[1] The final Conference of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community and The Bahamas at which this informal participation by The Bahamas continued was November 1982 Conference in Jamaica.[6] At the next Conference, The Bahamas was formally admitted as a member of the Community.[7]\\r\\nThe Dominican Republic cooperates with CARICOM (since 1992) under an umbrella organisation, CARIFORUM, an economic pact between CARICOM and the Dominican Republic with the EU.[8] The Dominican Republic became an Observer of CARICOM in 1982 and in 1991 it presented CARICOM with a request for full membership,[9] having first given consideration to joining the bloc in 1989.[10] It also has an unratified free trade agreement (from 2001) with CARICOM. Within the EPA between the region and the European Commission, the Dominican Republic is given means for dispute resolution with CARICOM member-states. Under Article 234, the European Court of Justice also carries dispute resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the European Union states.[11] This is particularly useful to the Dominican Republic which is not a member of the Caribbean Court of Justice and therefore cannot use the CCJ for dispute resolution with states of CARICOM.\\r\\nIn 2005 the Foreign Minister of the Dominican Republic proposed for the second time that the government of the Dominican Republic wished to obtain full membership status in CARICOM. However, due to the sheer size of the Dominican Republic's population and its economy being almost as large as all the current CARICOM states combined and coupled with the Dominican Republic's checkered history of foreign policy solidarity with the CARICOM states, it is unclear whether the CARICOM states will unanimously vote to admit the Dominican Republic as a full member into the organisation. CARICOM has been working at great pains in trying to integrate with Haiti. It has been proposed that CARICOM may deepen ties with the Dominican Republic through the auspice of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) instead, which is an organisation that stops just short of the Single market and economy which underpins CARICOM.\\r\\nIn July 2013, The President of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina, indicated that his country was still interested in joining CARICOM and appealed to CARICOM leaders meeting in Trinidad for the 40th anniversary of CARICOM to admit his country into the organization.[12] His bid drew the support of Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister and the then Chairwoman of CARICOM, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who addressed the others CARICOM heads of government by saying The ongoing reform process in the community must be one that will make CARICOM not only more efficient and effective but more relevant as well. In this regard, may I urge you to consider expanding our membership to welcome the Dominican Republic into the CARICOM family. It is not clear whether the CARICOM Heads of Government will agree, but the move could prove critical as the Dominican Republic increasingly allies itself both with Latin America and Central America, having become a full member state of the Central American Integration System in late June 2013 (it was previously an associate member).[13] The call for the Dominican Republic to be admitted as a full member of CARICOM was given a boost by the position of the Prime Minister of Barbados, Freundel Stuart, who confirmed that the Dominican Republic was re-committed to joining the movement at such time that it would be convenient for all the perceivable imperatives to be satisfied, and that I agree with the Prime Minister that the larger the bloc becomes, the more powerful the bloc becomes and the more diversified the areas for joint action and for integration. Stuart also remarked that it was a healthy development when Suriname and Haiti joined the movement and that the Heads of Government want to quicken the momentum in the expansion of CARICOM to countries without British heritage.[14]\\r\\nIn November 2013, CARICOM announced that it would \\"suspend consideration of the request by the Dominican Republic for membership of the Caribbean Community\\" in response to a Dominican court ruling which revoked citizenship from tens of thousands, mostly descendants from illegal immigrants from Haiti.[15][16]\\r\\nThe French Republic extends to several islands in the Caribbean that are not associated with CARICOM, and are instead part of the European Union: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Martin, Saint Barthlemy and French Guiana. The CARICOM-DR-EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) presently provides these areas with access to CARICOM markets. It was announced during summer of 2012 that the outer region area of Martinique, was pushing for France to become an Associate Member. Trepubhe Foreign Minister of France, Laurent Fabius, agreed to France being an associate member of CARICOM.[citation needed] At the Thirty-Fourth Meeting of the Heads of Government Conference in July 2013, the Heads of Government received the report of the Technical Working Group (TWG) established to review and provide recommendations on the terms and conditions of Membership and Associate Membership of the Community. They also agreed that the applications for Associate Membership of France (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique) and the Kingdom of the Nertherlands (Cura?ao and St. Maarten), would require further deliberation at the level of Heads of Government.[17]\\r\\nIn January 2015, it was reported that representatives of the French Republic had begun discussion with CARICOM on their application for associate membership. Teams from French Guiana (led by the President of the French Guiana Regional Council, Rodolphe Alexandre) and from Martinique met with CARICOM's Secretary-General Irwin LaRocque on 22 January 2015 and 21 January 2015 respectively. A team from Guadeloupe is due to hold similar discussion in February 2015.[18]\\r\\nThe discussions focused on regional cooperation, the terms and conditions for associate membership and the overall relation between the French Republic and CARICOM. Rodolphe Alexandre said that support in French Guiana strongly agreed with convergence of the Caribbean in health, climate change, education, economics and issues of bio-diversity. He also noted that French Guiana had already engaged with individual Community member states on issues related to mining (in this case, with Suriname) and energy (Trinidad & Tobago).[18]\\r\\nThe first attempt by Haiti to join CARICOM began on 6 May 1974, when Haiti officially applied for membership in the Community[19] after Edner Brutus, the Haitian Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to William Demas, CARICOM's Secretary-General formally applying for membership.[20] Shortly after that request, Haiti lobbied for admission, dealing mostly with Percival J. Patterson, then Jamaicas minister of industry, commerce, and tourism. Patterson welcomed the initiative and promised Jamaicas unconditional support. Despite Pattersons efforts, the CARICOM secretariat did not respond positively to the request, and CARICOM leadership decided to pursue a special type of relationship with Haiti.[19] Haiti was later accepted as an observer[19] in 1982 [21] following an application for closer relations with the Community.[6] On July 3, 1997, almost 25 years later, CARICOM chairman and Prime Minister of Jamaica Percival J. Patterson announced that Haiti was to become the fifteenth member country of CARICOM[19] after the Heads of Government, in accordance with Article 29 of the (Original) Treaty of Chaguaramas had unanimously agreed to it.[22] This announcement was made alongside Haitian President Ren Prval at an unscheduled joint press conference in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Technically, Haiti had joined the Caribbean Community but not the common market (similar to The Bahamas' membership). It was later announced that, in accordance with Article 29(2) of the Treaty of Chaguaramas,[22] a CARICOM technical working group would visit Haiti to consult with the Haitian government on the terms and conditions of full membership in CARICOM. The decision to admit Haiti raised a host of technical issues, including Haitis CARICOM dues, the extent to which French would also become an official language of CARICOM, and the extent to which existing CARICOM provisions allowing for the unfettered movement of member nationals would apply to Haiti. In the interim, Haiti was invited to participate in the deliberations of CARICOMs organs and bodies.[19][22]\\r\\nAt the Twentieth Heads of Government meeting, in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, the Heads of Government and Haiti exchanged notes agreeing on the terms and conditions under which Haiti would accede to Membership of the Community. The Heads of Government looked forward to the early deposit of an Instrument of Accession by Haiti to the Treaty of Chaguaramas.[23]\\r\\nIn preparation for the finalization of Haiti's membership of the Community, in February 2001 at the Twelfth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government held in Barbados,[24] the Conference emphasised the necessity for Haiti to adhere, as is required of all Community Member States, to the Charter of Civil Society, and in keeping with Haiti's undertaking as a condition of its Terms of Accession to the Caribbean Community[25] The Conference also agreed at the invitation of President Aristide, to explore the possibility of a joint CARICOM/International Mission to Haiti and decided to establish a CARICOM Office in Haiti at the earliest possible opportunity, and to foster contacts at all levels between the citizens of Haiti and the people of the Caribbean Community.[25]\\r\\nHaiti was admitted as the fifteenth Member State of the Caribbean Community on 2 July 2002 following the deposit of the Instrument of Accession by Haiti for membership[26] at the 23rd Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in Georgetown, Guyana[27] after Haiti's parliament ratified the Treaty of Chaguaramas as well as the terms and conditions for Haiti's entry as a full member of the Caribbean Community including the Single Market and Economy in May 2002.[28]\\r\\nAruba is an observer of CARICOM, as was the Netherlands Antilles before its dissolution in 2010. No official report has been published on the eligibility for observer status of the Caribbean countries Cura?ao and Sint Maarten and the three special municipalities of the Netherlands formed by the split.\\r\\nThe Netherlands Antilles had applied for the status of associate membership in 2005,[29] and both Cura?ao and Sint Maarten launched applications to become associate members in CARICOM after their secession.[30] In February 2012, the Prime Minister of Sint Maarten, Sarah Wescot-Williams said she was pleased that a working group had been set up in Caricom to examine St.?Maarten's request for associate membership and was looking forward to its report.[31] Former Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce (CAIC) Secretary Ludwig Ouenniche said the St.?Maarten Chamber of Commerce, of which he also served as a board member, has been \\"aggressive in advising\\" the St.?Maarten government to move towards a closer relationship with CARICOM over the years due to the Chamber's membership in the CAIC. The benefits for St.?Maarten are vast, especially the ability to tap into funding and programmes not accessible now because of non-membership, he added. Caricom countries are benefiting from European Union funding and other sources of financing shut off to St.?Maarten because of its constitutional position as a country within the Dutch Kingdom; associate membership would clear this barrier. Among the benefits would be access to cheaper generic medication to treat, for example, HIV/AIDS thanks to Caricom agreements and programmes. What makes this move even more important is the benefit the country would be able to reap for the large number of people living in St.?Maarten who are originally from Caricom member countries; according to Ouenniche \\"some 65 per cent\\" of St.?Maarten's population is of Caricom origin.[32]\\r\\nIn September 2015, a delegation from Sint Maarten met with the Caricom Secretary-General to continue discussing the terms and conditions of the associate membership status that St. Maarten is seeking. The delegation also received information on the work, structure and ongoing reforms of the Secretariat and the Community. As an observer, St. Maarten has attended meetings of the COHSOD (Council for Human and Social Development) and participates in the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) and offers the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) curricula and examinations in its schools.[33] In October 2016, at the margins of an EU-Caribbean conference on sustainable energy in Bridgetown, Barbados, the Prime Minister of Sint Maarten, William Marlin, met with CARICOM's Secretary General Ambassador Mr. Irwin LaRocque to discuss the progress of Sint Maarten's application for associate membership and the potential for further, structured regional cooperation between CARICOM/CARIFORUM and the Caribbean Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) of the EU. Ambassador LaRocque informed Prime Minister Marlin that the associate membership applications of Sint Maarten, Curacao and Aruba were being attended to be a technical working group established specially for devising the terms and conditions of associate membership, as such terms had not been spelled out in the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. LaRocque also noted that CARICOM was working on an enlargement policy for new member states to be submitted to the Heads of Government for agreement by the end of the year. Sint Maarten had officially applied for associate membership of CARICOM in January 2014 when it sent an official letter of interest. [34]\\r\\nIn the 1973, around the time the Caribbean Free Trade Association was being transformed into CARICOM, Suriname was granted Liaison Status/Observer Status in the Association.[21][35][36] This followed on from a decision of the Conference of Commonwealth Caribbean Heads of Government in 1972 to study the possibility of extending the integration movement to include all the Caribbean islands and Suriname.[37] This marked the beginning of the re-engagement of Suriname and Anglophone Caribbean in terms of economic and political cooperation, following a period from 1926 to the 1960s when representatives from Suriname first attended the British Guiana and West Indian Labour Conferences (BGWILC) and then became members of the Caribbean Labour Congress.[38][39][40][41][42] The early Labour Conferences had called for the establishment of a federation in the British West Indies, and eventually also led to the establishment of the CLC in 1945.[38][42][39] The CLC itself was active until 1956, at which point it was dissolved following first a schism in the regional trade union movement that reflected the global split between the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in 1949, and secondly the establishment of a rival body, the Caribbean Division of ORIT (the ICFTU Inter American Regional Organisation of Workers) or CADORIT in 1952.[38][42] CADORIT continued to consist of representatives from the British and Dutch West Indies (including Suriname) and was transformed in the Caribbean Congress of Labour (CCL) in 1960, again with the same membership that included Suriname.[38][42] By then however the early drive of the BGWILC/CLC to promote economic and political cooperation among its delegates' member territories had lost steam, partly because of the successful achievement of a federation among some of the British West Indian territories in 1958 and because that very federation began to falter in 1961-1962. The prospects for economic integration of Suriname with the Anglophone Caribbean only briefly experienced a resurgence in 1964-1965 as Eric Williams had engaged in (ultimately failed) diplomacy to establish a Caribbean Economic Community encompassing all of the Anglophone Caribbean, the Dutch West Indies (Netherlands Antilles and Suriname) and the French West Indies.[43]\\r\\nOn 14 April 1974, Suriname (along with Haiti) signified its desire to join CARICOM at the ceremony in St. Lucia marking the signing of the Treaty of Chaguaramas by the LDCs.[20] Talks of regional cooperation between Suriname and CARICOM were undertaken in the early 1970s, but integration was not further pursued, in part due to the perceived difficulties of integrating Suriname's very different legal system with that of the Commonwealth Caribbean countries.[44] Suriname continued to be an observer with regards to CARICOM after it came into existence, participating in a number of meetings of functional committees since the 1970s.[21] In the 1980s, Suriname expressed renewed interest in CARICOM[45] with initiatives to seek closer ties with the Community being welcomed in January 1982 by then Secretary-General Dr. Kurleigh King on a visit to the country[46][47] and the Surinamese application for closer relations with the Community being considered at the November 1982 Conference of the Heads of Government.[6] However, opposition by the member states to fuller Surinamese participation in CARICOM developed after the December 1990 \\"telephone coup\\" in Suriname, although Suriname retained observer status.[48] After democracy and civilian control was restored through the 1991 elections, Suriname began taking concrete steps to open its economy, emerge from isolation, and forge a new regional identity.[44] As a result, the ties between Suriname and the Community deepened and a Coordinating Unit for CARICOM Affairs was established and located in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Suriname. The CARICOM Coordinating Unit in Suriname had a core of three officers and was assisted in its task by CARICOM focal point officers representing the various other ministries with a supportive role being played by the Embassy of Guyana.[49]\\r\\nAt the Second Special Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in October 1992, it was affirmed by the Conference that membership or a special form of relationship should be open to Suriname with regards to the Community.[50] In 1993 an Action Plan for Cooperation among the Caribbean Community, Suriname and the Group of Three was negotiated covering a wide range of areas including business, small enterprise development, tourism, transport, culture, science, agriculture, multilateral financing, and hemispheric trade.[51] In 1994 Suriname applied for full membership of the Community and Common Market, with the application being welcomed by the Heads of Government at the Fifteenth Meeting of the Conference. It was agreed to establish a review process including a small technical group to develop, with the Government of Suriname, under the co-ordination of the Bureau of the Conference, details with respect to both the application for membership of the Community, and the transitional arrangements with respect to membership of the Common Market. The Conference agreed that they would seek to make a determination of the application at the next Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference.[50] At that Inter-Sessional Meeting the Heads of Government agreed to approve the application by Suriname for membership in the Caribbean Community and Common Market with effect from the Sixteenth Meeting of the Conference, in July 1995, on terms and conditions agreed by both sides.[52]\\r\\nOn 4 July 1995, The Conference formally admitted Suriname as the fourteenth Member of the Caribbean Community, following the deposit of the Instruments of Accession to the Treaty of Chaguaramas and the Common Market Annex. The instrument of Accession to the Common Market made provision for Suriname to implement the arrangements relating to the Common Market effective 1 January 1996.[53] Suriname's accession to the Community and the Common Market led to significant changes in Suriname's external trade policy as prior to accession, a multiple tariff regime ranging from 0 to 100 percent under the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature (BTN) classification system was in force. In preparation for CARICOM membership, this system was replaced in 1994 with the Harmonized System (HS) used as the basis for determining duty-free entry of goods of CARICOM origin and for applying the common external tariff. Suriname's 1996 entry into the free trade area was immediate with no major transition phase contemplated in the accession agreement apart from some exceptions granted under the Treaty of Chaguaramas and a few others negotiated by Suriname upon entry.[44]\\r\\nIn 2007, the U.S. Virgin Islands government announced it would begin seeking ties with CARICOM.[54] At the time it was not clear what membership status the USVI would obtain should they join CARICOM with the most likely possibility being observer status, considering fellow U.S. Caribbean territory Puerto Rico's current observer status. In 2012, it was confirmed by the USVI Commissioner of Tourism, Beverly Nicholson-Doty, that the U.S. Virgin Islands government has been lobbying for observer status within CARICOM.[55]\\r\\nAt a meeting of the Caribbean Tourism Organization in Martinique on October 19, 2013, the Governor of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) John de Jongh said his administration has drafted legislation that will allow visitors from the CARICOM full members and associate members to enter that territory without a US visa. This comes as part of the USVI governments plans to encourage more CARICOM nationals to visit the USVI.[56]\\r\\nIf successful the proposal would recreate the visa-free regime which existed for CARICOM nationals travelling to the USVI prior to 1975. At that time, the United States imposed visa requirements on Commonwealth Caribbean nationals travelling to the USVI, resulting in the 1975 Caricom Heads of Government Conference passing a resolution expressing concerning for the viability of the LIAT airline as a result of the new visa requirements and calling on the United States to revise the new visa policy and to implement the required measures arising from decisions at a meeting of Labour Departments and Ministries of English-speaking Caribbean countries in St. Thomas to institute screening procedures in order regularize the immigration of CARICOM nationals to the USVI.[4]\\r\\nde Jongh said the proposal has received bi-partisan support in the US House of Representatives[57] as well as support the Senate and the Department of Homeland Security,[56] but admits he doesn't know how soon the regime could be implemented, noting the pace of legislation in the U.S. Congress.[56][57]\\r\\nThe governor is, however, confident of a positive outcome having already had discussions on the subject with officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to come up with a regime which they will feel comfortable with.[57]\\r\\nde Jongh said the US Virgin Islands wants closer relations with the 15-member CARICOM grouping[58] and wants an opportunity to share in the movement of Caribbean nationals throughout the region[56] and is convinced that making travel easier for Caricom countries' nationals will be beneficial to the territories.[57]\\r\\nWe recognise that with respect to sports tourism, sailing events and shopping, the region presents tremendous opportunity, De Jongh told regional journalists.[57]\\r\\nThe initiative by de Jongh is actually not new having been first launched in 2012,[59] when de Jongh was quoted as saying that the waivers would be specifically for individuals who are traveling for sporting events, medical services, and general tourism.[60]\\r\\nde Jongh is further quoted as saying: We fully believe that such a change would broaden our reach into neighboring Caribbean markets. The territorys sporting events are growing in popularity and prestige, especially for competitions in volleyball, track, tennis, swimming and sailing. An amendment to the immigration bill would allow for easier travel for athletes, as well as for individuals seeking top-notch medical care or just looking for a great place for a vacation, that is close to home.[60]\\r\\nThe bill was relaunched (entitled The Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2013)[61] and introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on May 14, 2013 and was referred to the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.[62] It was not enacted during the life of that Congress.[62]\\r\\nOn April 29, 2015 the new Virgin Islands delegate, Stacey Plaskett, reintroduced the identical bill (now entitled The Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2015) to the U.S. House of Representatives.[63] On the same day it was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and then on June 1, 2015 it was referred to the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security[64]\\r\\nDelegate Plaskett, stated that the Bill (along with two others introduced by her) were geared towards improving the economy of the US Virgin Islands, with the special visa waiver program in particular aimed at boosting tourism by allowing the US Virgin Islands host more participants in seasonal regional sporting events and patients intending to access the US Virgin Islands' medical facilities without the need for visas.[65][66]\\r\\nCaricom nationals would still require a visa to travel to the U.S. mainland and other U.S. territories.[57]\\r\\nAlthough the group has close ties with Cuba, that nation was excluded due to lack of full democratic internal political arrangement.","input":"Which country was the last to join caricom?"},{"output":"338,226","context":"The Dunkirk evacuation, code-named Operation Dynamo and also known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, was the evacuation of Allied soldiers during World War II from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, in the north of France, between 26 May and 4 June 1940.\\r\\nThe operation commenced after large numbers of British, French, and Belgian troops were cut off and surrounded by German troops around the mid-point of the six-week long Battle of France. In a speech to the House of Commons, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called this \\"a colossal military disaster\\", saying \\"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.[7] In his \\"we shall fight on the beaches\\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \\"miracle of deliverance\\".[8]\\r\\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, France and the British Empire declared war and imposed an economic blockade. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the Phoney War of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, the Netherlands, and France on 10 May 1940. Three of their Panzer corps attacked through the Ardennes and drove northwest to the English Channel. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French armies along the northern coast of France. Commander of the BEF, General Viscount Gort, immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port. On 22 May a halt order was issued by the German High Command, with Adolf Hitler's approval. Preventing the evacuation was left to the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), until this order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave trapped Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the Battle of Dunkirk. From 28 to 31 May, in the Siege of Lille, the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German divisions, including three armoured divisions.\\r\\nOn the first day only 7,669 men were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 soldiers had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 boats. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective mole onto 39 destroyers of the British Royal Navy, 4 Royal Canadian Navy destroyers,[3] and civilian merchant ships, while others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what came to be known as the little ships of Dunkirk, a flotilla of hundreds of merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft, yachts, and lifeboats called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment.\\r\\nIn his speech to the House of Commons on 4 June, Churchill reminded the country that \\"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1939, after Nazi Germany invaded Poland, the United Kingdom sent the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at Cherbourg, Nantes, and Saint-Nazaire. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten divisions in three corps under the command of General John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort.[10][11] Working with the BEF were the Belgian Army and the French First, Seventh, and Ninth Armies.[12]\\r\\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the Maginot Line, a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the French Army. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, avoiding a repeat of the First World War.[13][14] The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded Ardennes region,[15] which French General Philippe Ptain declared to be \\"impenetrable\\" as long as \\"special provisions\\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a pincer attack and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, Maurice Gamelin, also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it \\"never favoured large operations\\".[16] With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.[13]\\r\\nThe initial plan for the German invasion of France called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.[17] Erich von Manstein, then Chief of Staff of the German Army Group A, prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the OKH (German High Command) via his superior, Generaloberst Gerd von Rundstedt.[18][19] Manstein's plan suggested that Panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish bridgeheads on the Meuse River and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the Allied armies in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the Sichelschnitt (\\"sickle cut\\").[19][20] Adolf Hitler approved a modified version of Manstein's ideas, today known as the Manstein Plan, after meeting with him on 17 February.[21]\\r\\nOn 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands.[22] Army Group B, under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock, attacked into Belgium, while the three Panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel.[23] The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the River Dyle within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May.[24][25] They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the Scheldt River on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold.[26] During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves.[27] On 19 May, Gort met with French General Gaston Billotte, commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities.[28] Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble.[29] After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at Arras to cut through the German spearhead,[30] the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.[31][32]\\r\\nWithout informing the French, the British began planning on 20 May for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF.[29][33] Dynamo took its name from the dynamo room that provided electricity in the naval headquarters below Dover Castle, where Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay planned the operation and briefed Churchill as it was under way.[34] Ships began gathering at Dover for the evacuation.[35] On 20 May, the BEF sent Brigadier Gerald Whitfield to Dunkirk to start evacuating unnecessary personnel. Overwhelmed by what he later described as \\"a somewhat alarming movement towards Dunkirk by both officers and men\\", due to a shortage of food and water, he had to send many along without thoroughly checking their credentials. Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.[36]\\r\\nOn 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in co-ordination with the French First Army under General Georges Blanchard to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces.[37] This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General Maxime Weygand, appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May.[38] On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at Gravelines.[39] Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.[40]\\r\\nBy 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of Boulogne and surrounded Calais.[31] The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under Generalmajor Rudolf Veiel built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk.[41] On 23 May, Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops.[42][43][44] He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30ÿ50 percent).[45][46] Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.[45]\\r\\nAir Marshal Hermann G?ring urged Hitler to let the Luftwaffe (aided by Army Group B[47]) finish off the British, to the consternation of Halder, who noted in his diary that the Luftwaffe was dependent upon the weather and air crews were worn out after two weeks of battle.[48] Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded. It was picked up by the RAF Y service at 12:42: \\"By order of the Fuhrer?... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens-Bethune-Aire-St Omer-Gravelines. The Canal will not be crossed.\\"[49][50] Later that day, Hitler issued Directive 13, which called for the Luftwaffe to defeat the trapped Allied forces and stop their escape.[51] At 15:30 on 26 May, Hitler ordered the panzer groups to continue their advance, but most units took another 16 hours to attack.[52] The delay gave the Allies time to prepare defences vital for the evacuation and prevented the Germans from stopping the Allied retreat from Lille.[53]\\r\\nThe halt order has been the subject of much discussion by historians.[54][55] Guderian considered the failure to order a timely assault on Dunkirk to be one of the major German mistakes on the Western Front.[56] Rundstedt called it \\"one of the great turning points of the war\\",[57] and Manstein described it as \\"one of Hitler's most critical mistakes\\".[58] B. H. Liddell Hart interviewed many of the generals after the war and put together a picture of Hitler's strategic thinking on the matter. Hitler believed that once Britain's troops left continental Europe, they would never return.[59]\\r\\nThe retreat was undertaken amid chaotic conditions, with abandoned vehicles blocking the roads and a flood of refugees heading in the opposite direction.[60][61] Due to wartime censorship and the desire to keep up British morale, the full extent of the unfolding disaster at Dunkirk was not initially publicised. A special service attended by King George VI was held in Westminster Abbey on 26 May, which was declared a national day of prayer.[62][63] The Archbishop of Canterbury led prayers \\"for our soldiers in dire peril in France\\". Similar prayers were offered in synagogues and churches throughout the UK that day, confirming to the public their suspicion of the desperate plight of the troops.[64] Just before 19:00 on 26 May, Churchill ordered Dynamo to begin, by which time 28,000 men had already departed.[29] Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the BEF within two days, at which time German troops were expected to block further evacuation. Only 25,000 men escaped during this period, including 7,669 on the first day.[65][66]\\r\\nOn 27 May, the first full day of the evacuation, one cruiser, eight destroyers, and 26 other craft were active.[67] Admiralty officers combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically taking part in the effort.[68] The same day, the Luftwaffe heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished.[69] An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town.[70] The Luftwaffe was met by 16 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft.[69][71] Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo.[71] The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.[72]\\r\\nOn 25 and 26 May, the Luftwaffe focused their attention on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, Lille, and Amiens, and did not attack Dunkirk.[70] Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May.[73] Remnants of the French First Army, surrounded at Lille, fought off seven German divisions (several of them armoured) until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender, having run out of food and ammunition.[74][75]\\r\\nThe Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May,[76] leaving a large gap to the east of Dunkirk. Several British divisions were rushed in to cover that side.[77] On 30 May, Churchill received word that all British divisions were now behind the defensive lines, along with more than half of the French First Army.[74] By this time, the perimeter ran along a series of canals about 7 miles (11?km) from the coast, in marshy country not suitable for tanks.[78] With the docks in the harbour rendered unusable by German air attacks, senior naval officer Captain (later Admiral) William Tennant initially ordered men to be evacuated from the beaches. When this proved too slow, he re-routed the evacuees to two long stone and concrete breakwaters, called the East and West Mole, as well as the beaches. Almost 200,000 troops embarked on ships from the East Mole (which stretched nearly a mile out to sea) over the next week.[79] On 28 May, 17,804 soldiers arrived at British ports.[66] On 29 May, 47,310 British troops were rescued.[66] Of the total 338,226 soldiers, several hundred were unarmed mule handlers, Muslim Indians on detachment from the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, forming four of the six units of Force K-6 transport. Three units were successfully evacuated and one captured.[80][81] Also present at Dunkirk were a small number of French Senegalese soldiers and Moroccans.[5][82]\\r\\nThe next day, an additional 53,823 men were embarked,[9] including the first French soldiers.[83] Lord Gort and 68,014 men were evacuated on 31 May,[84] leaving Major-General Harold Alexander in command of the rearguard.[85] A further 64,429 Allied soldiers departed on 1 June,[66] before the increasing air attacks prevented further daylight evacuation.[86] The British rearguard of 4,000 men left on the night of 2ÿ3 June.[87] An additional 75,000 French troops were retrieved over the nights of 2ÿ4 June,[66][88] before the operation finally ended. The remainder of the rearguard40,000 French troopssurrendered on 4 June.[87] Churchill made a point of stating in his We shall fight on the beaches address in the House on 4 June, that the evacuation had been made possible through the efforts of the RAF.[72]\\r\\nThree routes were allocated to the evacuating vessels. The shortest was Route Z, a distance of 39 nautical miles (72?km), but it entailed hugging the French coast and thus ships using it were subject to bombardment from on-shore batteries, particularly in daylight hours.[89][90] Route X, although the safest from shore batteries, travelled through a particularly heavily mined portion of the Channel. Ships on this route travelled 55 nautical miles (102?km) north out of Dunkirk, proceeded through the Ruytingen Pass,[91] and headed towards the North Goodwin Lightship before heading south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover.[89][90] The route was safest from surface attacks, but the nearby minefields and sand banks meant it could not be used at night.[92] The longest of the three was Route Y, a distance of 87 nautical miles (161?km); using this route increased the sailing time to four hours, double the time required for Route Z. This route followed the French coast as far as Bray-Dunes, then turned north-east until reaching the Kwinte Buoy.[93] Here, after making an approximately 135-degree turn, the ships sailed west to the North Goodwin Lightship and headed south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover.[89][90] Ships on Route Y were the most likely to be attacked by German surface vessels, submarines, and the Luftwaffe.[94]\\r\\n\\"You knew this was the chance to get home and you kept praying, please God, let us go, get us out, get us out of this mess back to England. To see that ship that came in to pick me and my brother up, it was a most fantastic sight. We saw dog fights up in the air, hoping nothing would happen to us and we saw one or two terrible sights. Then somebody said, theres Dover, that was when we saw the White Cliffs, the atmosphere was terrific. From hell to heaven was how the feeling was, you felt like a miracle had happened.\\"\\r\\nThe Royal Navy provided the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Calcutta, 39 destroyers, and many other craft. The Merchant Navy supplied passenger ferries, hospital ships, and other vessels. Britain's Belgian, Dutch, Canadian,[3] and French allies provided vessels as well. Admiral Ramsay arranged for around a thousand copies to be made of the required charts, had buoys laid around the Goodwin Sands and down to Dunkirk, and organised the flow of shipping.[92] Larger ships such as destroyers were able to carry about 900 men per trip. The soldiers mostly travelled on the upper decks for fear of being trapped below if the ship sank.[96] After the loss on 29 May of 19 British and French navy ships plus three of the larger requisitioned vessels, the Admiralty withdrew their eight best destroyers for the future defence of the country.[97]\\r\\nA wide variety of small vessels from all over the south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They included speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft.[99] The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed.[99] Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.[100]\\r\\nThe first of the \\"little ships\\" arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May.[96] The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about 100 yards (91?m) from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out.[101] In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them.[102] In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.[103] In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at De Panne and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.[104]\\r\\nBefore the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the House of Commons on 28 May to expect \\"hard and heavy tidings\\".[105] Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a \\"miracle\\", and the British press presented the evacuation as a \\"disaster turned to triumph\\" so successfully, that Churchill had to remind the country, in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June, that \\"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\\"[9]\\r\\nThree British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German \\"race to the sea\\". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a Second BEF. The majority of the 51st (Highland) Division was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15ÿ25 June under the codename Operation Ariel.[106] The Germans marched into Paris on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.[107]\\r\\nThe more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.[108] British ships ferried French troops to Brest, Cherbourg, and other ports in Normandy and Brittany, although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.[109] Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined Charles de Gaulle's Free French army in Britain.[110]\\r\\nIn France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral Fran?ois Darlan originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.[111] In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of 2nd Light Mechanized Division and the 68th Infantry Division.[112][113] Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.[66]\\r\\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated \\"Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of material have been captured. The greatest battle in the history of the world has come to an end.\\"[a][114] Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, the German armed forces high command) announced the event as \\"the greatest annihilation battle of all time\\".[115]\\r\\nThe BEF lost 68,000 soldiers (dead, wounded, missing, or captured) from 10 May until the armistice with France on 22 June.[116] 3,500 British were killed[117] and 13,053 wounded.[118] All the heavy equipment had to be abandoned. Left behind in France were 2,472 guns, 20,000 motorcycles, and almost 65,000 other vehicles; also abandoned were 416,000 short tons (377,000?t) of stores, more than 75,000 short tons (68,000?t) of ammunition and 162,000 short tons (147,000?t) of fuel.[119] Almost all of the 445 British tanks that had been sent to France with the BEF were abandoned.[120]\\r\\nSix British and three French destroyers were sunk, along with nine other major vessels. In addition, 19 destroyers were damaged.[121] Over 200 British and Allied sea craft were sunk, with a similar number damaged.[122] The Royal Navy's most significant losses in the operation were six destroyers:\\r\\nThe French Navy lost three destroyers:\\r\\nThe RAF lost 145 aircraft, of which at least 42 were Spitfires, while the Luftwaffe lost 156 aircraft in operations in the nine days of Operation Dynamo,[127] including 35 destroyed by Royal Navy ships (plus 21 damaged) during the six days from 27 May to 1 June.[128]\\r\\nFor every seven soldiers who escaped through Dunkirk, one man was left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water that had been left at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.[129]\\r\\nMany of the prisoners were marched to the city of Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were marched to the river Scheldt and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. The prisoners were then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany.[130] The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture for the remainder of the war.[131]\\r\\nThe missing dead of the BEF are commemorated on the Dunkirk Memorial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St George's Cross defaced with the arms of Dunkirk flown from the jack staff is the warranted house flag of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships. It is known as the Dunkirk jack. The flag is flown only by civilian vessels that took part in the Dunkirk rescue operation.[132][third-party source needed]","input":"How many british troops were rescued in the 1940 dunkirk evacuation?"},{"output":"New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia","context":"The Chesapeake Bay (/?t??s?pi?k/ CHESS-?-peek) is an estuary in District of Columbia and the U.S. states of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia, lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean and surrounded to the west by the North American mainland and to the east by the Delmarva Peninsula.[2] With its northern portion in Maryland and the southern part in Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's 64,299-square-mile (166,534?km2) drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) and all of Washington, D.C.[2][3]\\r\\nThe bay is approximately 200 miles (320?km) long from its northern headwaters in the Susquehanna River to its outlet in the Atlantic Ocean. It is 2.8 miles (4.5?km) wide at its narrowest (between Kent County's Plum Point near Newtown and the Harford County shore near Romney Creek) and 30 miles (48?km) at its widest (just south of the mouth of the Potomac River). Total shoreline including tributaries is 11,684 miles (18,804?km), circumnavigating a surface area of 4,479 square miles (11,601?km2). Average depth is 21 feet (6.4?m), reaching a maximum of 174 feet (53?m).[4] The bay is spanned twice, in Maryland by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Sandy Point (near Annapolis) to Kent Island and in Virginia by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel connecting Virginia Beach to Cape Charles. Known for both its beauty and bounty, the bay has become \\"emptier\\", with fewer crabs, oysters and watermen in past years.[5] Recent restoration efforts begun in the 1990s have been ongoing and show potential for growth of the native oyster population.[6][7] The health of the Chesapeake Bay improved in 2015, marking three years of gains over the past four years, according to a new report by the University of Maryland.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Chesepiooc is an Algonquian word referring to a village \\"at a big river\\". It is the seventh oldest surviving English place-name in the U.S., first applied as \\"Chesepiook\\" by explorers heading north from the Roanoke Colony into a Chesapeake tributary in 1585 or 1586. The name may also refer to the Chesepian or Chesapeake people, a Native American tribe who inhabited the area now known as South Hampton Roads in the U.S. state of Virginia. They occupied an area which is now the Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach areas.[9] In 2005, Algonquian linguist Blair Rudes \\"helped to dispel one of the area's most widely held beliefs: that 'Chesapeake' means something like 'great shellfish bay.' It does not, Rudes said. The name might actually have meant something like 'great water,' or it might have just referred to a village location at the bay's mouth.\\"[10] In addition, the name is almost always prefixed by \\"the\\" in usage by local residents: \\"The Chesapeake\\", \\"The Chesapeake Bay\\" and \\"The Bay\\".[11]\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay is an estuary to the North Atlantic, lying between the Delmarva Peninsula to the east and the North American mainland to the west. It is the ria, or drowned valley, of the Susquehanna River, meaning that it was the alluvial plain where the river flowed when the sea level was lower. It is not a fjord, because the Laurentide Ice Sheet never reached as far south as the northernmost point on the bay. North of Baltimore, the western shore borders the hilly Piedmont region of Maryland; south of the city the bay lies within the state's low-lying coastal plain, with sedimentary cliffs to the west, and flat islands, winding creeks and marshes to the east. The large rivers entering the bay from the west have broad mouths and are extensions of the main ria for miles up the course of each river.\\r\\nThe bay's geology, its present form, and its very location were created by a bolide impact event at the end of the Eocene (about 35.5 million years ago), forming the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and the Susquehanna River valley much later. The bay was formed starting about 10,000 years ago when rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age flooded the Susquehanna River valley.[3] Parts of the bay, especially the Calvert County, Maryland, coastline, are lined by cliffs composed of deposits from receding waters millions of years ago. These cliffs, generally known as Calvert Cliffs, are famous for their fossils, especially fossilized shark teeth which are commonly found washed up on the beaches next to the cliffs. Scientists' Cliffs is a beach community in Calvert County named for the desire to create a retreat for scientists when the community was founded in 1935.[12]\\r\\nMuch of the bay is shallow. At the point where the Susquehanna River flows into the bay, the average depth is 30 feet (9?m), although this soon diminishes to an average of 10 feet (3?m) southeast of the city of Havre de Grace, Maryland, to about 35 feet (11?m) just north of Annapolis. On average, the depth of the bay is 21 feet (6.4?m), including tributaries;[13] over 24 percent of the bay is less than 6?ft (2?m) deep.[14]\\r\\nBecause the bay is an estuary, it has fresh water, salt water and brackish water. Brackish water has three salinity zones: oligohaline, mesohaline, and polyhaline. The freshwater zone runs from the mouth of the Susquehanna River to north Baltimore. The oligohaline zone has very little salt. Salinity varies from 0.5?ppt (parts per thousand) to 10?ppt, and freshwater species can survive there. The north end of the oligohaline zone is north Baltimore and the south end is the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The mesohaline zone has a medium amount of salt and runs from the Bay Bridge to the mouth of the Rappahannock River. Salinity there ranges from 10.7?ppt to 18?ppt. The polyhaline zone is the saltiest zone, and some of the water can be as salty as sea water. It runs from the mouth of the Rappahannock River to the mouth of the bay. The salinity ranges from 18.7?ppt to 36?ppt. (36?ppt is as salty as the ocean.)[15]\\r\\nThe climate of the area surrounding the bay is primarily humid subtropical, with hot, very humid summers and cold to mild winters. Only the area around the mouth of the Susquehanna River is continental in nature, and the mouth of the Susquehanna River and the Susquehanna flats often freeze in winter. It is rare for the surface of the bay to freeze in winter, something which happened most recently in the winter of 1976ÿ77.[16]\\r\\nThe largest rivers flowing directly into the bay, from north to south, are:\\r\\nAnother river flowing into Chesapeake Bay is the Wicomico River, not to be confused with the tributary of the Potomac River.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay is home to numerous fauna that either migrate to the bay at some point during the year or live there year-round. There are over 300 species of fish and numerous shellfish and crab species. Some of these include the Atlantic menhaden, striped bass, American eel, eastern oyster, and the blue crab.[17]\\r\\nBirds include ospreys, great blue herons, bald eagles,[18] and peregrine falcons, the last two of which were threatened by DDT; their numbers plummeted but have risen in recent years.[19] The piping plover is a near threatened species which inhabits the wetlands.[19]\\r\\nLarger fish such as Atlantic sturgeon,[20] varieties of sharks,[21][22] and stingrays visit the Chesapeake Bay.[23][dead link] The waters of the Chesapeake Bay have been regarded one of the most important nursery areas for sharks along east coasts.[24] Megafaunas such as bull sharks, tiger sharks, scalloped hammerhead sharks, and basking sharks[24] and manta rays are also known to visit.\\r\\nBottlenose dolphins are known to live seasonally/yearly in the bay.[25] There have been unconfirmed sightings of humpback whales in recent years.[26][27] Endangered North Atlantic right whale[28] and fin, and minke and sei whales have also been sighted within and in the vicinity of the bay.[23]\\r\\nAlthough the bay is farther north than its typical habitat range, a male manatee visited the bay several times between 1994 and 2011. The manatee, recognizable due to distinct markings on its body, was nicknamed \\"Chessie\\" after a legendary sea monster that was allegedly sighted in the bay during the 20th century.[29][30][31] The same manatee has been spotted as far north as Rhode Island, and was the first manatee known to travel so far north.[32] Other manatees are occasionally seen in the bay and its tributaries, which contain sea grasses that are part of the manatee's diet.[33]\\r\\nLoggerhead turtles are known to visit the bay.[23]\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay is also home to a diverse flora, both land and aquatic. Common submerged aquatic vegetation includes eelgrass and widgeon grass. A report in 2011 suggested that information on underwater grasses would be released, because \\"submerged grasses provide food and habitat for a number of species, adding oxygen to the water and improving water clarity.\\"[34] Other vegetation that makes its home in other parts of the bay are wild rice, various trees like the red maple, loblolly pine and bald cypress, and spartina grass and phragmites.[35] Invasive plants have taken a significant foothold in the bay; plants such as Brazilian waterweed, native to South America, have spread to most continents with the help of aquarium owners, who often dump the contents of their aquariums into nearby lakes and streams. It's highly invasive, and has the potential to flourish in the low-salinity tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dense stands of Brazilian waterweed can restrict water movement, trap sediment and affect water quality. Various local K-12 schools in the Maryland and Virginia region often have programs that cultivate native bay grasses and plant them in the bay.\\r\\nIn 1524, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, (1485ÿ1528), in service of the French crown, (famous for sailing through and thereafter naming the entrance to New York Bay as the \\"Verrazzano Narrows\\", including now in the 20th century, a suspension bridge also named for him) sailed past the Chesapeake, but did not enter the bay.[38] Spanish explorer Lucas Vsquez de Ayll܇n sent an expedition out from Hispaniola in 1525 which reached the mouths of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. It may have been the first European expedition to explore parts of the Chesapeake Bay, which the Spaniards called \\"Baha de Santa Mara\\" (\\"Bay of St. Mary\\")or \\"Baha de Madre de Dios.\\"(\\"Bay of the Mother of God\\")[39] De Ayll܇n established a short-lived Spanish mission settlement, San Miguel de Gualdape, in 1526 along the Atlantic coast. Many scholars doubt the assertion that it was as far north as the Chesapeake; most place it in present-day Georgia's Sapelo Island.[40] In 1573, Pedro Menndez de Mrquez, the governor of Spanish Florida, conducted further exploration of the Chesapeake.[38] In 1570, Spanish Jesuits established the short-lived Ajacan Mission on one of the Chesapeake tributaries in present-day Virginia.\\r\\nThe arrival of English colonists under Sir Walter Raleigh and Humphrey Gilbert in the late 16th century to found a colony, later settled at Roanoke Island (off the present-day coast of North Carolina) for the Virginia Company, marked the first time that the English approached the gates to Chesapeake Bay between the capes of Cape Charles and Cape Henry. Three decades later, in 1607, Europeans again entered the bay. Captain John Smith of England explored and mapped the bay between 1607 and 1609, resulting in the publication in 1612 back in the British Isles of \\"A Map of Virginia\\".[41] Smith wrote in his journal: \\"Heaven and earth have never agreed better to frame a place for man's habitation.\\"[42] The new laying out of the \\"Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail\\", the United States' first designated \\"all-water\\" National Historic Trail, was created in July 2006, by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior following the route of Smith's historic 17th-century voyage.[43] Because of economic hardships and civil strife in the \\"Mother Land\\", there was a mass migration of southern English Cavaliers and their servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640 and 1675, to both of the new colonies of the Province of Virginia and the Province of Maryland.\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay was the site of the Battle of the Chesapeake (also known as the \\"Battle of the Capes\\", Cape Charles and Cape Henry) in 1781, during which the French fleet defeated the Royal Navy in the decisive naval battle of the American Revolutionary War. The British defeat enabled General George Washington and his French allied armies under Comte de Rochambeau to march down from New York and bottle up the rampaging southern British Army of Lord Cornwallis from the North and South Carolinas at the siege of Battle of Yorktown in Yorktown, Virginia. Their marching route from Newport, Rhode Island through Connecticut, New York State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware to the \\"Head of Elk\\" by the Susquehanna River along the shores and also partially sailing down the bay to Virginia. It is also the subject of a designated National Historic Trail under the National Park Service as the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route.\\r\\nThe bay would again see conflict during War of 1812. During the year of 1813, from their base on Tangier Island, British naval forces under the command of Admiral George Cockburn raided and plundered several towns on the shores of the Chesapeake, treating the bay as if it were a \\"British Lake\\". The Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, a fleet of shallow-draft armed barges under the command of U.S. Navy Commodore Joshua Barney, was assembled to stall British shore raids and attacks. After months of harassment by Barney, the British landed on the west side of the Patuxent at Benedict, Maryland, the Chesapeake Flotilla was scuttled, and the British trekked overland to burn the US Capitol in August 1814. A few days later in a \\"pincer attack\\", they also sailed up the Potomac River to attack Fort Washington below the National Capital and demanded a ransom from the nearby port town of Alexandria, Virginia.\\r\\nThere were so-called \\"Oyster Wars\\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Until the mid-20th century, oyster harvesting rivaled the crab industry among Chesapeake watermen, a dwindling breed whose skipjacks and other workboats were supplanted by recreational craft in the latter part of the century.[44]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant on the historic Calvert Cliffs in Calvert County on the Western Shore of Maryland began using water from the bay to cool its reactor.\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay forms a link in the Intracoastal Waterway, of the bays, sounds and inlets between the off-shore barrier islands and the coastal mainland along the Atlantic coast connecting the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (linking the bay to the north and the Delaware River) with the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal (linking the bay, to the south, via the Elizabeth River, by the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth to the Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound in North Carolina and further to the Sea Islands of Georgia). A busy shipping channel (dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since the 1850s) runs the length of the bay, is an important transit route for large vessels entering or leaving the Port of Baltimore, and further north through the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to the ports of Wilmington and Philadelphia on the Delaware River.\\r\\nDuring the later half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, the bay was plied by passenger steamships and packet boat lines connecting the various cities on it, notably the Baltimore Steam Packet Company (\\"Old Bay Line\\").\\r\\nIn the later 20th century, a series of road crossings were built. One, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (also known as the Governor William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge) between the state capital of Annapolis, Maryland and Matapeake on the Eastern Shore, crossing Kent Island, was constructed 1949-1952. A second, parallel, span was added in 1973. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, connecting Virginia's Eastern Shore with its mainland (at the metropolitan areas of Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Chesapeake), is approximately 20 miles (32?km) long; it has trestle bridges as well as two stretches of two-mile-long (3.2?km) tunnels which allow unimpeded shipping; the bridge is supported by four 5.25-acre (21,200?m2) man-made islands. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel was opened for two lanes in 1964 and four lanes in 1999.[45][46]\\r\\nTides in the Chesapeake Bay exhibit an interesting and unique behavior due to the nature of the topography (both horizontal and vertical shape), wind driven circulation, and how the bay interacts with oceanic tides. Research into the peculiar behavior of tides both at the northern and southern extents of the bay began in the late 1970s. One study noted sea level fluctuations at periods of 5 days, driven by sea level changes at the bays mouth on the Atlantic coast and local lateral winds, and 2.5 days, caused by resonant oscillations driven by local longitudinal winds,[47] while another study later found that the geometry of the bay permits for a resonant period of 1.46 days.[48]\\r\\nA good example of how the different Chesapeake Bay sites experience different tides can be seen in the tidal predictions published by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (see figure at right).\\r\\nAt the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel (CBBT) site, which lies at the southernmost point of the bay where it meets the Atlantic Ocean near Norfolk, Virginia and the capes of Charles and Henry, there is a distinct semi-diurnal tide throughout the lunar month, with small amplitude modulations during spring (new/full moon) vs. neap (one/three quarter moon) tidal periods. The main forcing of the CBBT tides are typical, semi-diurnal ocean tides that the East Coast of the United States experiences.\\r\\nBaltimore, in the northern portion of the bay, experiences a noticeable modulation to form its mixed tidal nature during spring vs. neap tides. Spring tides, when the sun-earth-moon system forms a line, cause the largest tidal amplitudes during lunar monthly tidal variations. In contrast, neap tides, when the sun-earth-moon system forms a right angle, are muted, and in a semi-diurnal tidal system (such as that seen at the CBBT site) this can be seen as a lowest intertidal range.\\r\\nTwo interesting points that arise from comparing these two sites at opposite ends of the bay are their tidal characteristics - semi-diurnal tide for CBBT and mixed tide for Baltimore (due to resonance in the bay) - and the differences in amplitude (due to dissipation in the bay).\\r\\nThe bay is mostly known for its seafood production, especially blue crabs,[49] clams and oysters. In the middle of the 20th century, the bay supported 9,000 full-time watermen, according to one account.[49] Today, the body of water is less productive than it used to be because of runoff from urban areas (mostly on the Western Shore) and farms (especially on the Eastern Shore and in the Susquehanna River watershed), over-harvesting, and invasion of foreign species.\\r\\nThe plentiful oyster harvests led to the development of the skipjack, the state boat of Maryland, which is the only remaining working boat type in the United States still under sail power. Other characteristic bay-area workboats include sail-powered boats such as the log canoe, the pungy, the bugeye, and the motorized Chesapeake Bay deadrise, the state boat of Virginia.[50]\\r\\nIn contrast to harvesting wild oysters, oyster farming is a growing industry for the bay to help maintain the estuary's productivity as well as a natural effort for filtering impurities such as excess nutrients from the water in an effort to reduce the effects of man-made pollution. The Chesapeake Bay Program is using oysters to reduce the amount of nitrogen compounds entering the Chesapeake Bay.[51]\\r\\nOysters are hermaphroditic and will change gender at least once during their lifetime, often starting as male and ending as female; there are numerous ways to cook and eat them, as well as recipes and sauces to accompany oyster dishes.[44] One account:\\r\\nThe Chesapeake oyster?ÿ sometimes called Chesapeake white gold?ÿ has a flavor and texture that begs connoisseurs to come back and shuck just a few more.\\r\\nThe bay is famous for its rockfish, a regional name for striped bass. Once on the verge of extinction, rockfish have made a significant comeback because of legislative action that put a moratorium on rockfishing, which allowed the species to re-populate. Rockfish can now be fished in strictly controlled and limited quantities.\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay is a main feature for tourists who visit Maryland and Virginia each year.[citation needed] Fishing, crabbing, swimming, boating, kayaking,[18] and sailing are extremely popular activities enjoyed on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. As a result, tourism has a notable impact on Maryland's economy.[52] One report suggested that Annapolis was an appealing spot for families, water sports and boating.[53] Commentator Terry Smith spoke about the bay's beauty:\\r\\nThe water is glassy, smooth and gorgeous, his wake white against the deep blue. That's the problem with the Chesapeake. It's so damned beautiful.[42]\\r\\nOne account suggested how the Chesapeake attracts people:\\r\\nYou see them everywhere on Maryland's Eastern Shore, the weekend sailors. They are unmistakable with their deep tans, their baggy shorts, their frayed polo shirts, their Top-Siders worn without socks. Some may not even own their own boats, much less win regattas, but they are inexorably drawn to the Chesapeake Bay?... I planned to spend my days boating, eating as many Chesapeake Bay blue crabs as possible and making a little study of Eastern Shore locals. For city folk like me, they're interesting, even exotic?ÿthe weather-beaten crabbers and oystermen called \\"watermen,\\" gentlemen-farmers and sharecroppers, boat builders, antiques dealers?ÿ all of whom sound like Southerners with mouthfuls of marbles when they talk.  Susan Spano, Los Angeles Times, 2008[54]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, the Chesapeake Bay was found to contain one of the planet's first identified marine dead zones, where waters were so depleted of oxygen that they were unable to support life, resulting in massive fish kills. Today the bay's dead zones are estimated to kill 75,000 tons of bottom-dwelling clams and worms each year, weakening the base of the estuary's food chain and robbing the blue crab in particular of a primary food source. Crabs are sometimes observed to amass on shore to escape pockets of oxygen-poor water, a behavior known as a \\"crab jubilee\\". Hypoxia results in part from large algal blooms, which are nourished by the runoff of residential, farm and industrial waste throughout the watershed. One report in 2010 criticized Amish farmers for having cows which \\"generate heaps of manure that easily washes into streams and flows onward into the Chesapeake Bay\\".[55]\\r\\nThe runoff and pollution have many components that help contribute to the algal bloom, which is mainly fed by phosphorus and nitrogen.[56] This algae prevents sunlight from reaching the bottom of the bay while alive and deoxygenates the bay's water when it dies and rots. The erosion and runoff of sediment into the bay, exacerbated by devegetation, construction and the prevalence of pavement in urban and suburban areas, also blocks vital sunlight. The resulting loss of aquatic vegetation has depleted the habitat for much of the bay's animal life. Beds of eelgrass, the dominant variety in the southern Chesapeake Bay, have shrunk by more than half there since the early 1970s. Overharvesting, pollution, sedimentation and disease have turned much of the bay's bottom into a muddy wasteland.[57]\\r\\nOne particularly harmful source of toxicity is Pfiesteria piscicida, which can affect both fish and humans. Pfiesteria caused a small regional panic in the late 1990s when a series of large blooms started killing large numbers of fish while giving swimmers mysterious rashes; nutrient runoff from chicken farms was blamed for the growth.[58]\\r\\nThe bay improved slightly in terms of the overall health of its ecosystem, earning a rating of 31 out of 100 in 2010, up from 28 in 2008.[2] An estimate in 2006 from a \\"blue ribbon panel\\" said cleanup costs would be $15 billion.[42] Compounding the problem is that 100,000 new residents move to the area each year.[42] A report in 2008 in the Washington Post suggested that government administrators had overstated progress on cleanup efforts as a way to \\"preserve the flow of federal and state money to the project.\\"[59] In January 2011, there were reports that millions of fish had died, but officials suggested it was probably the result of extremely cold weather.[60]\\r\\nWhile the bay's salinity is ideal for oysters and the oyster fishery was at one time the bay's most commercially viable,[61] the population has in the last fifty years been devastated. Maryland once had roughly 200,000 acres (810?km2) of oyster reefs. Today it has about 36,000.[61] It has been estimated that in pre-colonial times, oysters could filter the entirety of the bay in about 3.3 days; by 1988 this time had increased to 325 days.[62] The harvest's gross value decreased 88% from 1982 to 2007.[63] One report suggested the bay had fewer oysters in 2008 than 25 years earlier.[5]\\r\\nThe primary problem is overharvesting. Lax government regulations allow anyone with a license to remove oysters from state-owned beds, and although limits are set, they are not strongly enforced.[61] The overharvesting of oysters has made it difficult for them to reproduce, which requires close proximity to one another. A second cause for the oyster depletion is that the drastic increase in human population caused a sharp increase in pollution flowing into the bay.[61] The bay's oyster industry has also suffered from two diseases: MSX and Dermo.[64]\\r\\nThe depletion of oysters has had a particularly harmful effect on the quality of the bay. Oysters serve as natural water filters, and their decline has further reduced the water quality of the bay. Water that was once clear for meters is now so turbid that a wader may lose sight of his feet while his knees are still dry.\\r\\nEfforts of federal, state and local governments, working in partnership through the Chesapeake Bay Program, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and other nonprofit environmental groups, to restore or at least maintain the current water quality have had mixed results. One particular obstacle to cleaning up the bay is that much of the polluting substances arise far upstream in tributaries lying within states far removed from the bay. Despite the state of Maryland spending over $100 million to restore the bay, conditions have continued to grow worse. Twenty years ago, the bay supported over six thousand oystermen. There are now fewer than 500.[65]\\r\\nEfforts to repopulate the bay via hatcheries have been carried out by a group called the Oyster Recovery Partnership, with some success. They recently placed 6 million oysters on eight acres (32,000?m2) of the Trent Hall sanctuary.[66] Scientists from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at the College of William & Mary claim that experimental reefs created in 2004 now house 180 million native oysters, Crassostrea virginica, which is far fewer than the billions that once existed.[67]\\r\\nThere are several magazines and publications that cover topics directly related to the Chesapeake Bay and life and tourism within the Bay region.\\r\\nThe Capital, a newspaper based in Annapolis, reports about news pertaining to the Western Shore of Maryland and the Annapolis area.[68] Chesapeake Bay Magazine and PropTalk focus on powerboating, while SpinSheet focuses on sailing.[69][70][71]\\r\\nSinger and songwriter Tom Wisner recorded several albums, often about the Chesapeake Bay.

The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus,[3] for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary.[4] It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.[5]\\r\\nProduction was discontinued on September 30, 1977, after the June 10, 1977, introduction of its successor, the Apple II, which Byte magazine referred to as part of the \\"1977 Trinity\\" of personal computing (along with the PET 2001 and the TRS-80).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 5, 1975, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club in Gordon French's garage. He was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the Apple I computer.[7] After building it for himself and showing it at the Club, he and Steve Jobs gave out schematics (technical designs) for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies. Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit boardjust the bare board, no electronic partsthat people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture, their first company, Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator. Very soon after, Steve Jobs arranged to sell \\"something like 50\\" completely built computers to the Byte Shop (a computer store in Mountain View, California) at $500 each. To fulfill the $25,000 order, they obtained $20,000 in parts at 30 days net and delivered the finished product in 10 days.[8]\\r\\nThe Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of US$666.66,[9] because Wozniak \\"liked repeating digits\\" and because of a one-third markup on the $500 wholesale price.[10]\\r\\nThe first unit produced was used in a high school math class, and donated to Liza Loop's public access computer center.[11] About 200 units were produced and all but 25 were sold during nine or ten months.[8]\\r\\nThe Apple I's built-in computer terminal circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a keyboard and a television set. Competing machines such as the Altair 8800 generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red LEDs, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a teletypewriter machine. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977, the price was dropped to $475.[12] It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the Apple II in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.[13] In October 1977, the Apple I was officially discontinued and removed from Apple's price list.[14] As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers.[15] These recovered boards were then destroyed by Apple, contributing to their rarity today.[16]\\r\\nAs of 2013, at least 63 Apple I computers have been confirmed to exist. Only six have been verified to be in working condition.\\r\\nBoth Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have stated that Apple did not assign serial numbers to the Apple l. Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them, which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler. A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as \\"01-00##\\" and anecdotal evidence suggests they are inventory control numbers added by the Byte Shop to the batch Apple sold them. These Byte Shop numbers have often erroneously been described as serial numbers by auction houses and in related press coverage.[42]\\r\\nSeveral Apple I clones and replicas have been released in recent years. These are all created by hobbyists and marketed to the hobbyist/collector community.

With the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, Islam spread across large parts of the subcontinent. In 1204, Bakhtiyar Khalji led the Muslim conquest of Bengal, marking the eastern-most expansion of Islam at the time.\\r\\nPrior to the rise of the Maratha Empire, which was followed by the conquest of India by the British East India Company, the Muslim Mughal Empire was able to annex or subjugate most of India's kings. However, it was never able to conquer the kingdoms in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, such as those of modern Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Nepal and Bhutan; the kingdoms of the extreme south of India, such as Travancore and Tamil Nadu; or the kingdoms in the east, such as the Ahom Kingdom in Assam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIslam in South Asia existed in communities along the Arab coastal trade routes in Sindh, Bengal, Gujarat, Kerala, and Ceylon as soon as the religion originated and had early gained acceptance in the Arabian Peninsula, though the first incursion by the new Muslim successor states of the Arab World occurred around 636 CE or 643 AD, during the Rashidun Caliphate, long before any Arab army reached the frontier of India by land.\\r\\nUthman b. Abul As Al Sakifi, governor of Bahrain and Oman, sent out ships to raid Thane, near modern-day Mumbai, while his brother Hakam sailed to Broach and a third fleet sailed to Debal under his younger brother Mughira either in 636 CE or 643 AD. According to one source all three expeditions were successful,[1] however, another source states Mughira was defeated and killed at Debal.[2] These expeditions were sent without the Caliph Umar's consent, and he rebuked Uthman, saying that had the Arabs lost any men the Caliph would have killed an equal number of men from Utham's tribe in retaliation.[1] The expeditions were sent to attack pirate nests, to safeguard Arabian trade in the Arabian Sea, and not to start the conquest of India.[3][4][5]\\r\\nThe kingdoms of Kapisa-Gandhara in modern-day Afghanistan, Zabulistan and Sindh (which then held Makran) in modern-day Pakistan, all of which were culturally and politically part of India since ancient times,[6] were known as \\"The Frontier of Al Hind\\". The first clash between a ruler of an Indian kingdom and the Arabs took place in 643 AD, when Arab forces defeated Rutbil, King of Zabulistan in Sistan.[7] Arabs led by Suhail b. Abdi and Hakam al Taghilbi defeated an Indian army in the Battle of Rasil in 644 AD at the Indian Ocean sea coast,[8] then reached the Indus River. Caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab denied them permission to cross the river or operate on Indian soil and the Arabs returned home.[9]\\r\\nAbdullah ibn Aamir led the invasion of Khurasan in 650 AD, and his general Rabi b. Ziyad Al Harithi attacked Sistan and took Zaranj and surrounding areas in 651 AD[10] while Ahnaf ibn Qais conquered the Hepthalites of Herat in 652 AD and advanced up to Balkh by 653 AD. Arab conquests now bordered the Kingdoms of Kapisa, Zabul and Sindh in modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Arabs levied annual tributes on the newly captured areas, and leaving 4,000 men garrisons at Merv and Zaranj retired to Iraq instead of pushing on against the frontier of India.[11] Caliph Uthman b. Affan sanctioned an attack against Makran in 652 AD, and sent a recon mission to Sindh in 653 AD. The mission described Makran as inhospitable, and Caliph Uthman, probably assuming the country beyond was much worse, forbade any further incursions into India.[12][13]\\r\\nThis was the beginning of a prolonged struggle between the rulers of Kabul and Zabul against successive Arab governors of Sistan, Khurasan and Makran in modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Kabul Shahi kings and their Zunbil kinsmen blocked access to the Khyber Pass and Gomal Pass routes into India from 653 to 870 AD,[14] while modern Balochistan, Pakistan, comprising the areas of Kikan or Qiqanan, Nukan, Turan, Buqan, Qufs, Mashkey and Makran, would face several Arab expeditions between 661 - 711 AD.[15] The Arabs launched several raids against these frontier lands, but repeated rebellions in Sistan and Khurasan between 653 - 691 AD diverted much of their military resources in order to subdue these provinces and away from expansion into Al Hind. Muslim control of these areas ebbed and flowed repeatedly as a result until 870 AD. Arabs troops disliked being stationed in Makran,[16] and were reluctant to campaign in the Kabul area and Zabulistan, the difficult terrain and underestimation of Zunbil's power,[17] Arab strategy to extract tribute instead of systematic conquest, and the fierce resistance of Zunbil and Turki Shah stalled Arab progress repeatedly in the \\"Frontier Zone\\".[18][19]\\r\\nMuawiyah established Umayyad rule over the Arabs after the first First Fitna in 661 AD, and resumed expansion of the Muslim Empire. After 663/665 AD, the Arabs launched an invasion against Kapisa, Zabul and what is now Pakistani Balochistan. Abdur Rahman b. Samurra besieged Kabul in 663 AD, while Haris b Marrah advanced against Kalat after marching through Fannazabur and Quandabil and moving through the Bolan Pass. King Chach of Sindh sent an army against the Arabs, the enemy blocked the mountain passes, Haris was killed and his army was annihilated. Al Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah took a detachment through the Khyber pass towards Multan in Southern Punjab in modern-day Pakistan in 664 AD, then pushed south into Kikan, and may have also raided Quandabil. Turki Shah and Zunbil expelled Arabs from their respective kingdoms by 670 AD, and Zunbil began assisting in organizing resistance in Makran.[8]\\r\\nArabs launched several campaigns in eastern Balochistan between 661 - 681 AD, four Arab commanders were killed during the campaigns, but Sinan b. Salma managed to conquer parts of Makran including the Chagai area,[20] and establish a permanent base of operations in 673 AD.[21] Rashid b. Amr, the next governor of Makran, subdued Mashkey in 672 AD,[22] Munzir b. Jarood Al Abadi managed to garrison Kikan and conquer Buqan by 681 AD, while Ibn Harri Al Bahili, conducted several campaigns to secure the Arab hold on Kikan, Makran and Buqan by 683 AD.[23][24] Zunbil saw off Arab campaigns in 668, 672 and 673 AD by paying tribute, although Arabs occupied the areas south of Helmand in 673 AD permanently[21][25] Zunbil defeated Yazid b. Salm's army in 681 AD at Junzah, and Arabs had to pay 500,000 dirhams to ransom their prisoners,[26] but the Arabs defeated and killed[vague] Zunbil in Sistan in 685. The Arabs were defeated in Zabul in next invaded Zabul in 693 AD.[27][vague][not in citation given]\\r\\nAl-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf Al Thaqifi, who had played a crucial role during the Second Fitna for the Umayyad cause, was appointed the governor of Iraq in 694 AD, further extended to Khurasan and Sistan in 697 AD. Al-Hajjaj also sponsored Muslim expansion in Makran, Sistan, Transoxiana and Sindh.[28][29]\\r\\nArab hold on Makran had weakened when Arab rebels seized the province, and Hajjaj had to send three governors between 694 - 707 AD before Makran was partially recovered by 694 AD.[18] Al Hajjaj also fought Zunbil in 698 AD and 700 AD. The 20,000 strong army led by Ubaidullah ibn Abu Bakra was trapped by the armies of Zunbil and Turki Shah near Kabul, and lost 15,000 men to thirst and hunger, earning this force the epithet of the \\"Doomed Army\\".[30][31] Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath led 20,000 troops each from Kufa and Basra[32] in a cautions but successful campaign in 700 AD, but when he wanted to stop during winter, Al-Hajjaj's insulting rebuke[33] led to mutiny.[34] The mutiny put down by 704 Ad, and Al-Hajjaj granted a 7-year truce to Zunbil\\r\\nRaja Dahir of Sindh had refused to return Arab rebels from Sindh[2][35] and furthermore, Meds and others.[36] Meds shipping from their bases at Kutch, Debal and Kathiawar.[36] in one of their raids had kidnapped Muslim women travelling from Sri Lanka to Arabia, thus providing a casus belli[36][37] against Sindh Raja Dahir[38] when Raja Dahir expressed his inability to help retrieve the prisoners. After two expeditions were defeated in Sindh[39][40][40] Al Hajjaj equipped an army built around 6,000 Syrian cavalry and detachments of mawali from Iraq,[41] six thousand camel riders, and a baggage train of 3,000 camels under his Nephew Muhammad bin Qasim to Sindh. His Artillery of five catapults were sent to Debal by sea[41] (\\"manjaniks\\").\\r\\nMuhammad bin Qasim departed from Shiraz in 710 CE, the army marched along the coast to Tiaz in Makran, then to the Kech valley. Muhammad re-subdued the restive towns of Fannazbur and Armabil, (Lasbela)[42] finally completing the conquest of Makran then the army met up with the reinforcements and catapults sent by sea near Debal and took Debal through assault.[41] From Debal the Arabs moved north along the Indus, clearing the region up to Budha, some towns like Nerun and Sadusan (Sehwan) surrendered peacefully[41] while tribes inhabiting Sisam were defeated in battle. Muhammad bin Qasim moved back to Nerun to resupply and receive reinforcements sent by Hajjaj.[41] The Arabs crossed the Indus further South and defeated the army of Dahir, who was killed.[43][44] The Arabs then marched north along the east bank of the Indus after the siege and capture of Rawer. Brahmanabad, then Alor (Aror) and finally Multan, were captured alongside other in-between towns with only light Muslim casualties.[41] Arabs marched up to the foothills of Kashmir along the Jhelum in 713 AD,[45] and the stormed on Al-Kiraj (probably the Kangra valley)[46] Muhammad was deposed after the death of Caliph Walid in 715 AD. Jai Singh, son of Dahir captured Brahmanabad and Arab rule was restricted to the Western shore of Indus.[47] Sindh was briefly lost to the caliph when the rebel Yazid b. Muhallab took over Sindh briefly in 720 AD.[48][not in citation given][49]\\r\\nJunaid b. Abd Al Rahman Al Marri became the governor of Sindh in 723 AD. Secured Debal, then defeat and killed Jai Singh[48][not in citation given][50] secured Sindh and Southern Punjaband stormed Al Kiraj (Kangra valley) in 724 AD.[46][51] Junaid next attacked a number of Hindu kingdoms in what is now Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh aiming at permanent conquest, but the chronology and area of operation of the campaigns during 725 - 743 AD is difficult to follow because accurate, complete information is lacking.[46] The Arabs moved east from Sindh in several detachments[1] and probably from attacked from both the land and the sea, occupying Mirmad (Marumada, in Jaisalmer), Al-Mandal (perhaps Okhamandal in Gujarat) or Marwar,[52] and Dahnaj, not identified, al-Baylaman (Bhilmal) and Jurz (Gurjara countrynorth Gujarat and southern Rajasthan).[53] and attacking Barwas (Broach), sacking Vallabhi.[54] Gurjara king Siluka[55] repelled Arabs from \\"Stravani and Valla\\", probably the area North of Jaisalmer and Jodhpur, and the invasion of Malwa but were ultimately defeated by Nagabhata I in 725 AD near Ujjain.[56] Arabs lost control over the newly conquered territories and Sindh due to Arab tribal infighting and Arab soldiers deserting the newly conquered territory[57] during in 731 AD.\\r\\nAl Hakam b. Awana Al Kalbi recovered Sindh, and in c733 AD, founded the garrison city of Al Mahfuza (\\"The Well Guarded\\") similar to Kufa, Basra and Wasit, on the eastern side of a lake near Brahmanabad.[46] Hakam next attempted to reclaim the conquests of Junaid in Al Hind. Arab records merely state that he was successful, Indian records at Navasari[58] details that Arab forces defeated \\"Kacchella, Saindhava, Saurashtra, Cavotaka, Maurya and Gurjara\\" kings . The city of Al Mansura (\\"The Victorious\\") was founded near Al Mahfuza to commemorate pacification of Sindh by Amr b. Muhammad in c738 AD.[46] Al Hakam next invaded the Deccan in 739 AD with the intention of permanent conquest, but was decisively defeated at Navsari by the viceroy Avanijanashraya Pulakesi of the Chalukya Empire serving Vikramaditya II. Arab rule was restricted to the west of Thar desert.\\r\\nWhen the Abbasid Revolution overthrew the Umayyads in 750 AD after the Third Fitna, Sindh became independent and was captured by Musa b. K'ab al Tamimi in 752 AD.[59] Zunbil had defeated the Arabs in 728 AD, and saw off two Abbasid invasions in 769 and 785 AD. Abbasids attacked Kabul several times and collected tribute between 787 Ad - 815 Ad and extracted tribute after each campaign. Abbasid Governor of Sindh, Hisham (7in office 768 - 773 AD) raided Kashmir, recaptured parts of Punjab from Karkota control,[60] and launched naval raids against ports of Gujarat in 758 and 770 AD,[61] which like other Abbasid Naval raids launched of 776 and 779 AD, gained no territory. Arabs occupied Sindian (Southern Kutch) in 810 AD, only to lose it in 841 AD.[62] Civil war erupted in Sindh in 842 AD, and the Habbari dynasty occupied Mansurah, and by 871, five independent principalities emerged, with the Banu Habbari clan controlling in Mansurah, Banu Munabbih occupying Multan, Banu Madan ruling in Makran, with Makshey and Turan falling to other rulers, all outside direct Caliphate control.[63] Ismaili missionaries found a receptive audience among both the Sunni and non-Muslim populations in Multan, which became a center of the Ismaili sect of Islam. The Saffarid Dynasty of Zaranj occupied Kabul and the kingdom of Zunbil permanently in 871 AD. A new chapter of Muslim conquests began when the Samanid Dynasty took over the Saffarid Kingdom and Sabuktigin seized Ghazni.\\r\\nMuslim incursions resumed under later Turkic and Central Asian Mongol dynasties with more local capitals, who supplanted the Caliphate and expanded their domains both northwards and eastwards and led to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.\\r\\nUnder Sabuktigin, Ghazni found itself in conflict with the Shahi Raja Jayapala. When Sabuktigin died and his son Mahmud ascended the throne in 998, Ghazni was engaged in the North with the Qarakhanids when the Shahi Raja renewed hostilities.\\r\\nIn the early 11th century, Mahmud of Ghazni launched seventeen expeditions into South Asia. In 1001, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni defeated Raja Jayapala of the Hindu Shahi Dynasty of Gandhara (in modern Afghanistan), the Battle of Peshawar and marched further into Peshawar (in modern Pakistan) and, in 1005, made it the center for his forces.\\r\\nThe Ghaznavid conquests were initially directed against the Ismaili Fatimids of Multan, who were engaged in an ongoing struggle with the Abbasid Caliphate in conjunction with their compatriots of the Fatimid Caliphate in North Africa and the Middle East; Mahmud apparently hoped to curry the favor of the Abbasids in this fashion. However, once this aim was accomplished, he moved onto the richness of the loot of wealthy temples and monasteries. By 1027, Mahmud had captured parts of North India and obtained formal recognition of Ghazni's sovereignty from the Abbassid Caliph, al-Qadir Billah.\\r\\nGhaznavid rule in Northwestern India (modern Afghanistan and Pakistan) lasted over 175 years, from 1010 to 1187. It was during this period that Lahore assumed considerable importance apart from being the second capital, and later the only capital, of the Ghaznavid Empire.\\r\\nAt the end of his reign, Mahmud's empire extended from Kurdistan in the west to Samarkand in the Northeast, and from the Caspian Sea to the Punjab. Although his raids carried his forces across Northern and Western India, only Punjab came under his permanent rule; Kashmir, the Doab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat remained under the control of the local Indian dynasties. In 1030, Mahmud fell gravely ill and died at age 59. As with the invaders of three centuries ago, Mahmud's armies looted temples in Varanasi, Mathura, Ujjain, Maheshwar, Jwalamukhi, Somnath and Dwarka.\\r\\nMu'izz al-Din better known as Shahb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori was a conqueror from the region of Ghor in Afghanistan. Before 1160, the Ghaznavid Empire covered an area running from central Afghanistan east to the Punjab, with capitals at Ghazni on the banks of Ghazni river in present-day Afghanistan, and at Lahore in present-day Pakistan. In 1160, the Ghorids conquered Ghazni from the Ghaznavids, and in 1173 Muhammad Bin Sm was made governor of Ghazni. He raided eastwards into the remaining Ghaznavid territory, and invaded Gujarat in the 1180s but was defeated by the Indian queen Naikidevi of Gujarat.[64][65] In 1186 and 1187 he conquered Lahore in alliance with a local Hindu ruler, ending the Ghaznavid empire and bringing the last of Ghaznavid territory under his control, and seemed to be the first Muslim ruler seriously interested in expanding his domain in the sub-continent, and like his predecessor Mahmud initially started off against the Ismaili kingdom of Multan that had regained independence during the Nizari conflicts, and then onto booty and power.\\r\\nIn 1191, he invaded the territory of Prithviraj III of Ajmer, who ruled much of present-day Rajasthan and Punjab, but was defeated at the First battle of Tarain.[66] The following year, Mu'izz al-Din assembled 120,000 horsemen and once again invaded India. Mu'izz al-Din's army met Prithviraj's army again at Tarain, and this time Mu'izz al-Din won; Govindraj was slain, Prithviraj executed[67] and Mu'izz al-Din advanced onto Delhi. Within a year, Mu'izz al-Din controlled Northern Rajasthan and Northern Ganges-Yamuna Doab. After these victories in India, and Mu'izz al-Din's establishment of a capital in Delhi, Multan was also incorporated into his empire. Mu'izz al-Din then returned east to Ghazni to deal with the threat on his eastern frontiers from the Turks and Mongols, whiles his armies continued to advance through Northern India, raiding as far east as Bengal.\\r\\nMu'izz al-Din returned to Lahore after 1200. In 1206, Mu'izz al-Din had to travel to Lahore to crush a revolt. On his way back to Ghazni, his caravan rested at Damik near Sohawa (which is near the city of Jhelum in the Punjab province of modern-day Pakistan). He was assassinated on 15 March 1206, while offering his evening prayers. The identity of Ghori's assassins is disputed, with some claiming that he was assassinated by local Hindu Gakhars and others claiming he was assassinated by Hindu Khokhars, both being different tribes.\\r\\nThe Khokhars were killed in large numbers, and the province was pacified. After settling the affairs in the Punjab. Mu'izz al-Din marched back to Ghazni. While camping at Dhamayak in 1206 AD in the Jehlum district, the sultan was murdered by the Khokhars[68]\\r\\nSome claim that Mu'izz al-Din was assassinated by the Hashshashin, a radical Ismaili Muslim sect.[69][70]\\r\\nAccording to his wishes, Mu'izz al-Din was buried where he fell, in Damik. Upon his death his most capable general, Qutb-ud-din Aybak, took control of Mu'izz al-Din's Indian conquests and declared himself the first Sultan of Delhi.[citation needed]\\r\\nMuhammad's successors established the first dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, while the Mamluk Dynasty in 1211 (however, the Delhi Sultanate is traditionally held to have been founded in 1206) seized the reins of the empire. Mamluk means \\"slave\\" and referred to the Turkic slave soldiers who became rulers. The territory under control of the Muslim rulers in Delhi expanded rapidly. By mid-century, Bengal and much of central India was under the Delhi Sultanate. Several Turko-Afghan dynasties ruled from Delhi: the Mamluk (1206ÿ1290), the Khalji (1290ÿ1320), the Tughlaq (1320ÿ1414), the Sayyid (1414ÿ51), and the Lodhi (1451ÿ1526). During the time of Delhi Sultanate, the Vijayanagara Empire resisted successfully attempts of Delhi Sultanate to establish dominion in the Southern India, serving as a barrier against invasion by the Muslims.[71] Certain kingdoms remained independent of Delhi such as the larger kingdoms of Punjab, Rajasthan, parts of the Deccan, Gujarat, Malwa (central India), and Bengal, nevertheless all of the area in present-day Pakistan came under the rule of Delhi.\\r\\nThe Sultans of Delhi enjoyed cordial, if superficial, relations with Muslim rulers in the Near East but owed them no allegiance. They based their laws on the Quran and the sharia and permitted non-Muslim subjects to practice their religion only if they paid the jizya (poll tax). They ruled from urban centres, while military camps and trading posts provided the nuclei for towns that sprang up in the countryside.\\r\\nPerhaps the most significant contribution of the Sultanate was its temporary success in insulating the subcontinent from the potential devastation of the Mongol invasion from Central Asia in the 13th century, which nonetheless led to the capture of Afghanistan and western Pakistan by the Mongols (see the Ilkhanate Dynasty). The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance, The resulting \\"Indo-Muslim\\" fusion left lasting monuments in architecture, music, literature, and religion. In addition it is surmised that the language of Urdu (literally meaning \\"horde\\" or \\"camp\\" in various Turkic dialects) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the mingling of Sanskritic Hindi and the Persian, Turkish, Arabic favoured by the Muslim invaders of India[citation needed].\\r\\nThe Sultanate suffered significantly from the sacking of Delhi in 1398 by Timur, but revived briefly under the Lodi Dynasty, the final dynasty of the Sultanate before it was conquered by Zahiruddin Babur in 1526, who subsequently founded the Mughal Dynasty that ruled from the 16th to the 18th centuries.\\r\\nTؐmr bin Taraghay Barlas, known in the West as Tamerlane or \\"Timur the lame\\", was a 14th-century warlord of Turco-Mongol descent,[72][73][74][75] conqueror of much of western and central Asia, and founder of the Timurid Empire (1370ÿ1507) in Central Asia; the Timurid dynasty survived until 1857 as the Mughal dynasty of India.\\r\\nInformed about civil war in South Asia, Timur began a trek starting in 1398 to invade the reigning Sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the Tughlaq Dynasty in the north Indian city of Delhi.[76] His campaign was politically pretexted that the Muslim Delhi Sultanate was too tolerant toward its \\"Hindu\\" subjects, but that could not mask the real reason being to amass the wealth of the Delhi Sultanate.[77]\\r\\nTimur crossed the Indus River at Attock (now Pakistan) on 24 September. In Haryana, his soldiers each killed 50 to 100 Hindus.[78]\\r\\nTimur's invasion did not go unopposed and he did meet some resistance during his march to Delhi, most notably with the Sarv Khap coalition in northern India, and the Governor of Meerut. Although impressed and momentarily stalled by the valour of Ilyaas Awan, Timur was able to continue his relentless approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398 to combat the armies of Sultan Mehmud, already weakened by an internal battle for ascension within the royal family.\\r\\nThe Sultan's army was easily defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed more than 100,000 \\"Hindu\\" captives.[72][76]\\r\\nTimur himself recorded the invasions in his memoirs, collectively known as Tuzk-i-Timuri.[72][72][76][79][80] Timur's purported autobiography, the Tuzk-e-Taimuri (\\"Memoirs of Temur\\") is a later fabrication, although most of the historical facts are accurate.[81]\\r\\nMuslim historian Irfan Habib writes in \\"Timur in the Political Tradition and Historiography of Mughal India\\" that in the 14th century, the word \\"Hindu\\" (people of \\"Al-Hind\\", \\"Hind\\" being \\"India\\") included \\"both Hindus and Muslims\\" in religious connotations.[82]\\r\\nWhen Timur entered Delhi after defeating Mahmud Toghloq's forces, he granted an amnesty in return for protection money (mal-e amani). But on the fourth day he ordered that all the people of the city be enslaved; and so they were. Thus reports Yahya, who here inserts a pious prayer in Arabic for the victims consolation (\\"To God we return, and everything happens by His will\\"). Yazdi, on the other hand, does not have any sympathy to waste on these wretches. He records that Timur had granted protection to the people of Delhi on the 18th of December 1398, and the collectors had begun collecting the protection money. But large groups of Timur's soldiers began to enter the city and, like birds of prey, attacked its citizens. The \\"pagan Hindus\\" (Henduan-e gabr) having had the temerity to begin immolating their women and themselves, the three cities of Delhi were put to sack by Timur's soldiers. \\"Faithless Hindus\\", he adds, had gathered in the Congregation Mosque of Old Delhi and Timur's officers put them ruthlessly to slaughter there on the 29th of December. Clearly, Yazdi's \\"Hindus\\" included Muslims as well.[clarification needed][83]\\r\\nHowever, that does not prove that the men gathering at the mosque were Muslims as it could have been Hindus who gathered at the Mosque for protection.\\r\\nThe statement implying that Muslims were targeted during the Dehli massacre was contradicted by Timur's own words, during the 15 day massacre of Dehli, Timur himself stated that \\"Excepting the quarters of the sayyids, the 'ulama and the other Musalmans (Muslims), the whole city was sacked\\", proving that Timur differentiated between the two religious groups (Muslims and Hindus).[84]\\r\\nDuring the mass murder of Delhi, Timur's soldiers massacred more than 150,000 Indians, and all inhabitants not killed were captured and enslaved.[85]\\r\\nTimur's memoirs on his invasion of India describe in detail the massacre of \\"Hindus\\", looting plundering and raping of their women and the plunder of the wealth of Hindustan (Greater India). It gives details of how villages, towns and entire cities were rid of their \\"Hindu\\" male population through systematic mass slaughters and genocide.\\r\\nTimur left Delhi in approximately January 1399. In April he had returned to his own capital beyond the Oxus (Amu Darya). Immense quantities of spoils were taken from India. According to Ruy Gonzles de Clavijo, 90 captured elephants were employed merely to carry precious stones looted from his conquest, so as to erect a mosque at Samarkand? what historians today believe is the enormous Bibi-Khanym Mosque. Ironically, the mosque was constructed too quickly and suffered greatly from disrepair within a few decades of its construction.\\r\\nIndia in the 16th century presented a fragmented picture of rulers, both Muslim and Hindu, who lacked concern for their subjects and failed to create a common body of laws or institutions.[citation needed] Outside developments also played a role in shaping events. The circumnavigation of Africa by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498 allowed Europeans to challenge Muslim control of the trading routes between Europe and Asia. In Central Asia and Afghanistan, shifts in power pushed Babur of Ferghana (in present-day Uzbekistan) southward, first to Kabul and then to India. The dynasty he founded endured for more than three centuries.\\r\\nThe Mughal Emperor Akbar shoots the Rajput warrior Jaimal during the Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567.\\r\\nBullocks dragging siege-guns up hill during Mughal Emperor Akbar's attack on Ranthambhor Fort in 1568.\\r\\nThe Mughal Army commanded by Akbar attack members of the Sannyasa during the Battle of Thanesar.\\r\\nMughal Emperor Akbar attempts to dissuade the young Hindu girl from committing sati[86]\\r\\nThe Mughal Emperor Akbar fights Pehlwani with his Hindu general Raja Man Singh I.\\r\\nRajput women commit Jauhar during Akbar's invasion.\\r\\nA War elephant executing the opponents of the Mughal Emperor Akbar.\\r\\nClaiming descent from both Genghis Khan and Timur, Babur combined strength and courage with a love of beauty, and military ability with cultivation. He concentrated on gaining control of Northwestern India, doing so in 1526 by defeating the last Lodhi Sultan at the First battle of Panipat, a town north of Delhi. Babur then turned to the tasks of persuading his Central Asian followers to stay on in India and of overcoming other contenders for power, mainly the Rajputs and the Afghans. He succeeded in both tasks but died shortly thereafter in 1530. The Mughal Empire was one of the largest centralised states in premodern history and was the precursor to the British Indian Empire.\\r\\nBabur was followed by his great-grandson, Shah Jahan (r. 1628ÿ58), builder of the Taj Mahal and other magnificent buildings. Two other towering figures of the Mughal era were Akbar (r. 1556ÿ1605) and Aurangzeb (r. 1658ÿ1707). Both rulers expanded the empire greatly and were able administrators. However, Akbar was known for his religious tolerance and administrative genius while Aurangzeb was a pious Muslim and fierce advocate of more orthodox Islam.\\r\\nWhile some rulers were zealous in their spread of Islam, others were relatively liberal. Moghul emperor Akbar was relatively liberal and established a new religion, Din E Elahi, which included beliefs from different religions. He abolished the jizya twice. In contrast, his great-grandson Aurangazeb was a more religious and orthodox ruler.\\r\\nIn the century-and-a-half that followed the death of Aurangzeb, effective Muslim control weakened. Succession to imperial and even provincial power, which had often become hereditary, was subject to intrigue and force. The mansabdari system gave way to the zamindari system, in which high-ranking officials took on the appearance of hereditary landed aristocracy with powers of collecting rents. As Delhi's control waned, other contenders for power emerged and clashed, thus preparing the way for the eventual British takeover.\\r\\nAhmed Shah Abdali?ÿ a Pashtun?ÿ embarked on a conquest in South Asia starting in 1747.[89] In the short space of just over a quarter of a century, he forged one of the largest Muslim empires of the 18th century. The high point of his conquests was his victory over the powerful Marathas in the third Battle of Panipat 1761. In South Asia his empire stretched from the Indus at Attock all the way to the outskirts of Delhi. Uninterested in long term of conquest or in replacing the Mughal Empire, he became increasingly pre occupied with revolts by the Sikhs.[90] His empire started to unravel not long after his death.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that the single most important power to emerge in the long twilight of the Mughal dynasty was the Maratha Confederacy (1674 CE - 1818 CE).[92] The Marathas are responsible, to a large extent, for ending Mughal rule in India.[93] The Maratha Empire ruled large parts of India following the decline of the Mughals. The long and futile war bankrupted one of the most powerful empires in the world. Mountstart Elphinstone termed this a demoralizing period for the Muslims as many of them lost the will to fight against the Maratha Empire.[94][95][96] Maratha empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu (Trichinopoly) \\"present Tiruchirappalli\\" in the south to the Afghan border in the north.[97][98][99] In early 1771, Mahadji, a notable Maratha general, recaptured Delhi and installed Shah Alam II as the puppet ruler on the Mughal throne. In north India, the Marathas thus regained the territory and the prestige lost as result of the defeat at Panipath in 1761.[100] However regions of Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Western Punjab, were captured by Marathas between 1758 and 1759, remained in Afghan rule before ascension of Sikh power.[101] Mahadji ruled the Punjab as it used to be a Mughal territory and Sikh sardars and other Rajas of the cis-Sutlej region paid tributes to him.[102] A considerable portion of the Indian subcontinent came under the sway of the British Empire after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, which ended the Maratha Empire in 1818.\\r\\nIn northwest India, in the Punjab, Sikhs developed themselves into a powerful force under the authority of twelve Misls. By 1801, Ranjit Singh captured Lahore and threw off the Afghan yoke from North West India.[103] In Afghanistan Zaman Shah Durrani was defeated by powerful Barakzai chief Fateh Khan who appointed Mahmud Shah Durrani as the new ruler of Afghanistan and appointed himself as Wazir of Afghanistan.[104] Sikhs however were now superior to the Afghans and started to annex Afghan provinces. The biggest victory of the Sikh Empire over the Durrani Empire came in the Battle of Attock fought in 1813 between Sikh and Wazir of Afghanistan Fateh Khan and his younger brother Dost Mohammad Khan. The Afghans were routed by the Sikh army and the Afghans lost over 9,000 soldiers in this battle. Dost Mohammad was seriously injured whereas his brother Wazir Fateh Khan fled back to Kabul fearing that his brother was dead.[105] In 1818 they slaughtered Afghans and Muslims in trading city of Multan killing Afghan governor Nawab Muzzafar Khan and five of his sons in the Siege of Multan.[106] In 1819 the last Indian Province of Kashmir was conquered by Sikhs who registered another crushing victory over weak Afghan General Jabbar Khan.[107] The Koh-i-Noor diamond was also taken by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1814. In 1823 a Sikh Army routed Dost Mohammad Khan the Sultan of Afghanistan and his brother Azim Khan at Naushera (Near Peshawar). By 1834 the Sikh Empire extended up to the Khyber Pass. Hari Singh Nalwa the Sikh general remained the governor of Khyber Agency till his death in 1837. He consolidated Sikh hold in tribal provinces. The northernmost Indian territories of Gilgit, Baltistan and Ladakh was annexed between 1831-1840.[108]\\r\\nConsiderable controversy exists both in scholarly and public opinion as to how conversion to Islam came about in Indian subcontinent, typically represented by the following schools of thought:[109]\\r\\nHindus who converted to Islam however were not completely immune to persecution due to the caste system among Muslims in India established by Ziauddin al-Barani in the Fatawa-i Jahandari,[111] where they were regarded as an \\"Ajlaf\\" caste and subjected to discrimination by the \\"Ashraf\\" castes.[112] Critics of the \\"religion of the sword theory\\" point to the presence of the strong Muslim communities found in Southern India, modern day Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, western Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines coupled with the distinctive lack of equivalent Muslim communities around the heartland of historical Muslim empires in South Asia as refutation to the \\"conversion by the sword theory\\".[110] The legacy of Muslim conquest of South Asia is a hotly debated issue even today. Not all Muslim invaders were simply raiders. Later rulers fought on to win kingdoms and stayed to create new ruling dynasties. The practices of these new rulers and their subsequent heirs (some of whom were borne of Hindu wives of Muslim rulers) varied considerably. While some were uniformly hated, others developed a popular following. According to the memoirs of Ibn Battuta who traveled through Delhi in the 14th century, one of the previous sultans had been especially brutal and was deeply hated by Delhi's population. His memoirs also indicate that Muslims from the Arab world, Persia and Turkey were often favored with important posts at the royal courts suggesting that locals may have played a somewhat subordinate role in the Delhi administration. The term \\"Turk\\" was commonly used to refer to their higher social status.[citation needed] However S.A.A. Rizvi[113] points to Muhammad bin Tughlaq as not only encouraging locals but promoting artisan groups such as cooks, barbers and gardeners to high administrative posts. In his reign, it is likely that conversions to Islam took place as a means of seeking greater social mobility and improved social standing.[114]\\r\\nIndependent scholar Matthew White, in his popular history book The Great Big Book of Horrible Things, claims that Aurangzeb's Deccan campaign saw one of the largest death tolls in South Asian history, with an estimated 4.6 million people killed during his reign, Muslims and Hindus alike.[115] According to research by Stanford University and Cambridge University academic historian Audrey Truschke,[116] states that according to primary source evidence, Aurangzeb \\"did not perpetrate anything resembling a genocide of Hindus.\\"[117]\\r\\nIslam's impact was the most notable in the expansion of trade. The first contact of Muslims with India was the Arab attack on a nest of pirates near modern-day Mumbai to safeguard their trade in the Arabian Sea. Around the same time many Arabs settled at Indian ports, giving rise to small Muslim communities. The growth of these communities was not only due to conversion but also the fact that many Hindu kings of south India (such as those from Cholas) hired Muslims as mercenaries.[118]\\r\\nA significant aspect of the Muslim period in world history was the emergence of Islamic Sharia courts capable of imposing a common commercial and legal system that extended from Morocco in the West to Mongolia in the North East and Indonesia in the South East. While southern India was already in trade with Arabs/Muslims, northern India found new opportunities. As the Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms of Asia were subjugated by Islam, and as Islam spread through Africa?ÿ it became a highly centralising force that facilitated in the creation of a common legal system that allowed letters of credit issued in say Egypt or Tunisia to be honoured in India or Indonesia (The Sharia has laws on the transaction of business with both Muslims and non-Muslims[citation needed]). In order to cement their rule, Muslim rulers initially promoted a system in which there was a revolving door between the clergy, the administrative nobility and the mercantile classes. The travels of explorer Muhammad Ibn-Abdullah Ibn-Batuta were eased because of this system. He served as an Imam in Delhi, as a judicial official in the Maldives, and as an envoy and trader in the Malabar. There was never a contradiction in any of his positions because each of these roles complemented the other. Islam created a compact under which political power, law and religion became fused in a manner so as to safeguard the interests of the mercantile class. This led world trade to expand to the maximum extent possible in the medieval world. Sher Shah Suri took initiatives in improvement of trade by abolishing all taxes which hindered progress of free trade. He built large networks of roads and constructed Grand Trunk Road (1540ÿ1544), which connects Chittagong to Kabul. Parts of it are still in use today. The geographic regions add to the diversity of languages and politics.\\r\\nThe divide and rule policies, two-nation theory, and subsequent partition of India in the wake of Independence from the British Empire has polarised the sub-continental psyche, making objective assessment hard in comparison to the other settled agricultural societies of India from the North West. Muslim rule differed from these others in the level of assimilation and syncretism that occurred. They retained their identity and introduced legal and administrative systems that superseded existing systems of social conduct and ethics. While this was a source of friction it resulted in a unique experience the legacy of which is a Muslim community strongly Islamic in character while at the same time distinctive and unique among its peers.\\r\\nThe impact of Islam on Indian culture has been inestimable. It permanently influenced the development of all areas of human endeavour?ÿ language, dress, cuisine, all the art forms, architecture and urban design, and social customs and values. Conversely, the languages of the Muslim invaders were modified by contact with local languages, to Urdu, which uses the Arabic script. This language was also known as Hindustani, an umbrella term used for the vernacular terminology of Hindi as well as Urdu, both major languages in South Asia today derived primarily from Sanskrit grammatical structures and vocabulary.\\r\\nMuslim rule saw a greater urbanisation of India and the rise of many cities and their urban cultures. The biggest impact was upon trade resulting from a common commercial and legal system extending from Morocco to Indonesia. This change of emphasis on mercantilism and trade from the more strongly centralised governance systems further clashed with the agricultural based traditional economy and also provided fuel for social and political tensions.\\r\\nA related development to the shifting economic conditions was the establishment of Karkhanas, or small factories and the import and dissemination of technology through India and the rest of the world. The use of ceramic tiles was adopted from architectural traditions of Iraq, Iran, and Central Asia. Rajasthan's blue pottery was a local variation of imported Chinese pottery. There is also the example of Sultan Abidin (1420ÿ70) sending Kashmiri artisans to Samarqand to learn book-binding and paper making. Khurja and Siwan became renowned for pottery, Moradabad for brass ware, Mirzapur for carpets, Firozabad for glass wares, Farrukhabad for printing, Sahranpur and Nagina for wood-carving, Bidar and Lucknow for bidriware, Srinagar for papier-mache, Benaras for jewellery and textiles, and so on. On the flip-side encouraging such growth also resulted in higher taxes on the peasantry.\\r\\nNumerous Indian scientific and mathematical advances and the Hindu numerals were spread to the rest of the world[2] and much of the scholarly work and advances in the sciences of the age under Muslim nations across the globe were imported by the liberal patronage of Arts and Sciences by the rulers. The languages brought by Islam were modified by contact with local languages leading to the creation of several new languages, such as Urdu, which uses the modified Arabic script, but with more Persian words. The influences of these languages exist in several dialects in India today.\\r\\nIslamic and Mughal architecture and art is widely noticeable in India, examples being the Taj Mahal and Jama Masjid. At the same time, Muslim rulers destroyed most of the ancient Indian architectural marvels and converted them into Islamic structures, most notably at Varanasi, Mathura, Ayodhya and the Kutub Complex in New Delhi.\\r\\nIn 1193, the Nalanda University complex was destroyed by Afghan Khalji-Ghilzai Muslims under Bakhtiyar Khalji; this event is seen as the final milestone in the decline of Buddhism in India. He also burned Nalanda's major Buddhist library and Vikramshila University,[119] as well as numerous Buddhist monasteries in India. When the Tibetan translator, Chag Lotsawa Dharmasvamin (Chag Lo-tsa-ba, 1197ÿ1264), visited northern India in 1235, Nalanda was damaged, looted, and largely deserted, but still standing and functioning with seventy students.\\r\\nMahabodhi, Sompura, Vajrasan and other important monasteries were found to be untouched. The Ghuri ravages only afflicted those monasteries that lay in the direct of their advance and were fortified in the manner of defensive forts.\\r\\nBy the end of the 12th century, following the Muslim conquest of the Buddhist stronghold in Bihar, Buddhism, having already declined in the South, declined in the North as well because survivors retreated to Nepal, Sikkim and Tibet or escaped to the South of the Indian sub-continent.\\r\\nThe city flourished between the 14th century and 16th century, during the height of the Vijayanagar Empire. During this time, it was often in conflict with the kingdoms which rose in the Northern Deccan, and which are often collectively termed the Deccan Sultanates. The Vijaynagar Empire successfully resisted Muslim invasions for centuries. But in 1565, the empire's armies suffered a massive and catastrophic defeat at the hands of an alliance of the Sultanates, and the capital was taken. The victorious armies then razed, depopulated and destroyed the city over several months. The empire continued its slow decline, but the original capital was not reoccupied or rebuilt.\\r\\nAround 1024 CE, during the reign of Bhima I, Mahmud of Ghazni raided Gujarat, and plundered the Somnath temple. According to a 1169 CE inscription, Bhima rebuilt the temple. This inscription does not mention any destruction caused by Mahmud, and states that the temple had \\"decayed due to time\\".[120] In 1299, Alauddin Khalji's army under the leadership of Ulugh Khan defeated Karandev II of the Vaghela dynasty, and sacked the Somnath temple.[120] The temple was rebuilt by Mahipala Deva, the Chudasama king of Saurashtra in 1308. It was repeatedly attacked in the later centuries, including by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.[121] In 1665, the temple, was once again ordered to be destroyed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.[122] In 1702, he ordered that if Hindus had revived worship there, it should be demolished completely.[123]\\r\\nGhazwa-e-Hind or the final battle of India is an Islamic term mentioned in some \\"good\\" hadiths in particular[124][125] predicting a final and last battle in India and as a result, a conquest of the whole Indian sub-continent by Muslim warriors. The term has recently become a subject of vast criticism in media for being used by militant groups to justify their activities in the subcontinent.[126][127][dubious ÿ discuss]","input":"When did arab invade on india first time?"},{"output":"San Francisco, California","context":"The Academy of Art University, formerly Academy of Art College, is a privately owned for-profit art school in San Francisco, California, in the United States.

The restaurant serves breakfast before transitioning to its lunch and dinner menu. Chick-fil-A also offers customers catered selections from its menu for special events.[5] Many of the company's values are influenced by its founder's Southern Baptist beliefs;[6] all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed for business on Sundays as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta,[3] and is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.\\r\\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[7] Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \\"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\\"[8] refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\\r\\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3] During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[9] The first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[10] and the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3] In October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan that became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[11][12] As of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3] It also has 31 drive-through-only locations.[3] Chick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC and the ACC of college athletics.[13][14]\\r\\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[15][16] This restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[15] However, per tradition, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day.\\r\\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[17] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18] Each operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\\r\\n- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.\\r\\n- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.\\r\\n- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.\\r\\n- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis goes to show how vastly different it is to be a Chick-fil-A store operator rather than being part of a regular franchise opportunity.[19] Since 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20] earning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger was second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\\r\\n\\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein dairy cows[22] that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease scare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\\r\\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24] The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \\"eat more\\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\\r\\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: \\"Eat More Kale\\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26] The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \\"corporate bullying.\\"[27] On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \\"Eat More Kale\\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\\r\\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \\"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\\"[29]\\r\\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill?ÿ later renamed the Dwarf House?ÿ in Hapeville, Georgia, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3] At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32] The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00?p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6?a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32] It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.\\r\\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update], 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\\r\\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia.[33] Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34][35][36] In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37][38]\\r\\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39] The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \\"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\\"[40]\\r\\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for one of the chain's distinctive features: all Chick-fil-A locations (corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays,[41] as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[42] Cathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \\"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\\"[43]\\r\\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because \\"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \\"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\\"[44]\\r\\nTheir website states, \\"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect ÿregardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\\"[45]\\r\\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night or Thursday night home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC and other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants will sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[46]\\r\\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage legislation.[47][48][49][50][51] Chick-fil-A clarified that \\"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\\".[52] The WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[53]\\r\\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5?million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3?million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[54] with the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] A total of $1.9?million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage & Family Foundation, Exodus International, and the Family Research Council (FRC).[63] That year, the FRC, which received $1,000[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] was listed as an anti-gay[64] hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[65][66][67] WinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Exodus International, the latter is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy.[63] In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride, suspended their campaign.[68][69][70]\\r\\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\\" were \\"inviting God's judgment on our nation\\".[71][72][73][74][75] Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[76] Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[77][78][79] The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.[80][81][82] The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[83][84][85] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[86] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \\"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[88][89][90] More than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook for Huckabee's appreciation event.[89] On August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[88][89][90] A consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\\r\\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \\"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \\"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\\"[91] In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \\"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\\"[92][93]\\r\\nAccording to Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation in an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[94]\\r\\nAccording to Focus on the Family's website, CitizenLink.com, \\"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\\"[95] Mike Huckabee stated that he \\"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[96][97]\\r\\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat free processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[98]\\r\\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari wrote a post titled \\"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ.[99] In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA headquarters.[100] In December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5 and had reduced the sodium content in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup in 2014.[100]\\r\\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[101]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is the first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving only poultry raised without antibiotics.[102]","input":"What religion is the owner of chick fil a?"},{"output":"Roman Peace","context":"The Pax Romana (Latin for \\"Roman Peace\\") was a long period of relative peace and minimal expansion experienced by the Roman Empire between the end of the Final War of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century, a span of roughly two hundred years. During this period, the Roman empire achieved its greatest territorial extent, and its population reached a maximum of up to 70 million people.[1] Since it was inaugurated by Augustus, it is sometimes called the Pax Augusta. Its span was approximately 206 years (27 BC to AD 180), from the accession of Augustus to the death of Marcus Aurelius.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pax Romana is said to have been a \\"miracle\\" because prior to it there had never been peace for so many centuries in a given period of history. However, Walter Goffart wrote: \\"The volume of the Cambridge Ancient History for the years A.D. 70ÿ192 is called 'The Imperial Peace', but peace is not what one finds in its pages\\".[3] Arthur M. Eckstein writes that the period must be seen in contrast to the much more frequent warfare in the Roman Republic in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Eckstein also notes that the incipient Pax Romana appeared during the Republic, and that its temporal span varied with geographical region as well: \\"Although the standard textbook dates for the Pax Romana, the famous Roman Peace in the Mediterranean, are 31 BC to AD 250, the fact is that the Roman Peace was emerging in large regions of the Mediterranean at a much earlier date: Sicily after 210 [BC], the Italian Peninsula after 200 [BC]; the Po Valley after 190 [BC]; most of the Iberian Peninsula after 133 [BC]; North Africa after 100 [BC]; and for ever longer stretches of time in the Greek East.\\"[4]\\r\\nThe first known record of the term Pax Romana appears in a writing by Seneca the Younger in 55 AD.[5] The concept was highly influential, and the subject of theories and attempts to copy it in subsequent ages. Arnaldo Momigliano noted that \\"Pax Romana is a simple formula for propaganda, but a difficult subject for research.\\"[6] In fact, the \\"Pax Romana\\" was broken by the First JewishÿRoman War, the Kitos War (also in Judea, 115ÿ117), the Bar Kokhba Revolt (also known as the Third JewishÿRoman War), the RomanÿParthian War of 58ÿ63, Trajan's RomanÿParthian War of 113, the Dacian Wars, various battles with Germanic tribes, including the Teutoburg Forest, and Boudica's war in Britain in AD 60 or 61.\\r\\nThe Pax Romana began when Octavian (Augustus) defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium on 2 September 31 BC and became the Roman emperor.[2][7][1] He became princeps, or first citizen. Lacking a good precedent of successful one-man rule, Augustus created a junta of the greatest military magnates and stood as the front man. By binding together these leading magnates in a coalition, he eliminated the prospect of civil war. The Pax Romana was not immediate, despite the end of the civil wars, because fighting continued in Hispania and in the Alps. Nevertheless, Augustus closed the Gates of Janus (a ceremony indicating that Rome was at peace) three times,[8] first in 29 BC and again in 25 BC. The third closure is undocumented, but Inez Scott Ryberg (1949) and Gaius Stern (2006) have persuasively dated the third closure to 13 BC with the commissioning of the Ara Pacis.[9][10][11] At the time of the Ludi Saeculares in 17 BC the Concept of Peace was publicised, and in 13 BC was proclaimed when Augustus and Agrippa jointly returned from pacifying the provinces. The order to construct the Ara Pacis was no doubt part of this announcement.\\r\\nAugustus faced a problem making peace an acceptable mode of life for the Romans, who had been at war with one power or another continuously for 200 years.[10] Romans regarded peace not as an absence of war, but the rare situation which existed when all opponents had been beaten down and lost the ability to resist.[6] Augustus' challenge was to persuade Romans that the prosperity they could achieve in the absence of warfare was better for the Empire than the potential wealth and honor acquired when fighting a risky war. Augustus succeeded by means of skillful propaganda. Subsequent emperors followed his lead, sometimes producing lavish ceremonies to close the Gates of Janus, issuing coins with Pax on the reverse, and patronizing literature extolling the benefits of the Pax Romana.[10]\\r\\nAfter Augustus' death in 14 AD, most of his successors as Roman emperors continued his politics. The last five emperors of the Pax Romana were considered the \\"Five Good Emperors\\".[1]\\r\\nRoman trade in the Mediterranean increased during the Pax Romana. Romans sailed East to acquire silks, gems, onyx and spices. Romans benefited from large profits and incomes in the Roman empire were raised due to trade in the Mediterranean.[12][13]\\r\\nAs the Pax Romana of the western world by Rome was largely contemporaneous to the Pax Sinica of the eastern world by Han China,[14][15] long-distance travel and trade in Eurasian history was significantly stimulated during these eras.[15]\\r\\nThe prominence of the concept of the Pax Romana led to historians coining variants of the term to describe other systems of relative peace that have been established, attempted, or argued to have existed. Some variants include:[2]\\r\\nMore generically, the concept has been referred to as pax imperia,[16][17] (sometimes spelled as pax imperium[18]) meaning imperial peace,[19][20] orless literallyhegemonic peace.[20][21] Raymond Aron notes that imperial peacepeace achieved through hegemonysometimes, but not alwayscan become civil peace. As an example, the German Empire's imperial peace of 1871 (over its internal components like Saxony) slowly evolved into the later German state. As a counter-example, the imperial peace of Alexander the Great's empire dissolved because the Greek city states maintained their political identity and more importantly, embryos of their own armed forces. Aron notes that during the Pax Romana, the Jewish war was a reminder that the overlapping of the imperial institutions over the local ones did not erase them and the overlap was a source of tension and flare-ups. Aron summarizes that, \\"In other words, imperial peace becomes civil peace insofar as the memory of the previously independent political units are effaced, insofar as individuals within a pacified zone feel themselves less united to the traditional or local community and more to the conquering state.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe concept of Pax Romana was highly influential, and attempts to imitate it occurred in the Byzantine Empire, and in the Christian West, where it morphed into the Peace and Truce of God (pax Dei and treuga Dei).[20] A theoretician of the imperial peace during the Middle Ages was Dante Aligheri. Dante's works on the topic were analyzed at the beginning of the 20th century by William Mitchell Ramsay in the book The Imperial Peace; An Ideal in European History (1913).[22][23]","input":"What does pax romana mean and why is it important?"},{"output":"the West Kootenay region of British Columbia in Canada and the adjacent regions of Eastern Washington in the United States","context":"The Sinixt[2] (also known as the Sin-Aikst or Sin Aikst,[3] \\"Senjextee\\", \\"Arrow Lakes Band\\",[2] or  less commonly in recent decades  simply as \\"The Lakes\\"[4]) are a First Nations People. The Sinixt are descended from indigenous peoples who have lived primarily in what are today known as the West Kootenay region of British Columbia in Canada and the adjacent regions of Eastern Washington in the United States for at least 10,000 years.[5] The Sinixt are of Salishan linguistic extraction, and speak their own dialect (sn-selxcin) of the Colville-Okanagan language.\\r\\nToday they live primarily on the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington, where they form part of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which is recognized by the United States government as an American Indian Tribe. Many Sinixt continue to live in their traditional territory on the Northern Side of the 49th Parallel, particularly in the Slocan Valley and scattered amongst neighbouring tribes throughout BC, however the Canadian Government declared the Sinixt extinct in 1956.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her anthropological study of the Sinixt in Canada, Keeping the Lakes Way, Paula Pryce notes that \\"despite their obscurity in Canada and the scattered documentation of their presence in the area, both archival and published material show that the Sinixt Interior Salish resided along the Columbia River, Arrow Lakes, Slocan Valley, and parts of Kootenay Lake...\\"[7] Other tribes used the Columbia as a trade route, passing through Sinixt territory to trade with the Sinixt and to trade further south. Parts of the traditional territory of the Sinixt are being claimed by the Westbank Band of the Okanagan people and as shared use and occupancy by the Ktunaxa. There is controversy over their historic claims to the area.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Lawney Reyes, the Sinixt numbered about 3,000 in the early 19th century,[8] divided into several bands of sizes suited to hunting and fishing. He distinguishes the \\"Upper Sin-Aikst\\" around the Arrow Lakes, \\"above Revelstoke and around the Castlegar, Trail, and Slocan Valley area\\" from the \\"Lower Sin-Aikst in the Northport, Bossburg, Marcus, and Kettle Falls area in Washington State.\\" The latter constituted \\"at least eight large bands\\". Once they obtained horses, they ranged farther east to hunt on the Great Plains.[9]\\r\\nIn prehistoric times, the Sinixt were a semi-sedentary people, living in warm, semi-subterranean houses for the winter months. Summers were spent fishing, hunting, and gathering other food resources in their mountain and lake-dominated homeland. Reyes says that they wintered in the more wind-sheltered valleys, but summered by the Columbia.[10] Scholars have classified the Sinixt as \\"complex collectors\\" (as opposed, for example, to \\"hunter-gatherers\\").\\r\\nSharon Montgomery of the Nakusp Museum, and tribal legend documented by Nancy Perkins Wynecoop and Nettie Wynecoop Clark[11] describe the Sinixt as the \\"Mother Tribe\\" of the Pacific Northwest Salish. In a recent interview with the journalist Rex Weyler, Bob Campbell, \\"Headman\\" of the Sinixt in British Columbia, notes that, \\"As the mother nation, we often settled disputes among the (other) bands.\\" Contributors to the article's forum refuted the claims as being without ethnographic or historical foundation.[12] Sinixt mitochondrial DNA can be found at the base of Native American Haplogroup B2.[13] (See GENBANK Accession EF648602.)[14]\\r\\nEarly white explorers reported the Sinixt to be of average height and size, with hazel eyes. They were adept in making suspended bridges over the narrow, swift-flowing Columbia, and skillful at fishing.[15]\\r\\nTheir staples included huckleberry, salmon, and roots (camas, bitterroot), but they also ate black moss, other berries (serviceberry, gooseberry, and foam berry), hazelnuts, wild carrots, peppermint, and various game meats (deer, elk, moose, caribou, rabbit, mountain sheep, mountain goat, and bear; after the coming of the horse, they also ventured east after bison). They chewed pine pitch like gum, and had a range of herbal medicines. Starting in June, mature salmon arrived at Kettle Falls, the farthest downriver that the Sinixt territory extended. The Sinixt caught only the salmon that were not strong enough to clear the falls, ensuring that the strongest went on to spawn. Both bands traveled to Red Mountain near Rossland, B.C. to harvest huckleberries in August. These seasonal events figured prominently in their culture. They hunted in late autumn, but still often were short of food by late winter.[16]\\r\\nThe Upper Sin Aikst trained dogs to drive deer toward the Columbia River, where hunters in canoes shot them with bow and arrow. The Sin Aikst used the distinctive Sturgeon-nosed canoe; about 15ÿ17 feet (4.5ÿ5 meters) long with a cedar frame covered by large slabs of pine bark, riding low in the water with downward-sloping tips to reduce wind resistance.[17]\\r\\nReyes says that they often intermarried with the Swhy-ayl-puh (Colville), who had a very similar language. The territory of the latter was largely in the Colville Valley and intersected Sinixt territory at Kettle Falls.[18]\\r\\nReyes gives an account of various Sinixt customs, especially related to pregnancy, birth, and education, as well as some descriptions of funerary customs. Children were \\"closely monitored\\" by elders. Children were sent on \\"short excursions\\" to search for protective spirits; they were usually required to bring back an object to prove that they had made the journey. As they grew older, until puberty, these journeys became longer. Each person was expected to acquire multiple spirits, because each had different powers.[19]\\r\\nAt about the age of six, the children began to be instructed in \\"the legends of the tribe and family history, tribal ways and tribal laws.\\" At eight or nine, they learned to swim and to run long distances; boys were taught to make and use weapons and fishing gear, while girls started to learn plant lore and tanning, as well as how to care for young children, maintain dwellings, and prepare meals.[20]\\r\\nSinixt religion was mainly \\"for harnessing power.\\" The sun, the stars, the water, and the different animals (especially the salmon and coyote) each had different powers.[21]\\r\\nThe whole tribe was led by one head chief (ilmi wm), but each smaller village of 50-200 had a local chief, whom they called a \\"thinker\\". These \\"thinkers\\" would come together to form a council.[22]\\r\\nThe Sinixt were a Matrilocal people, with newly married couples living with the wife's family rather than the husband's.[22]\\r\\nThere is historical evidence suggesting that the Sinixt were heavily depopulated by one or two smallpox epidemics that preceded the arrival of Scottish and Mtis fur-traders of the North West Company. The epidemic of 1781 was likely the biggest single outbreak, with accounts of that epidemic describing a mortality rate up to 80%. David Thompson and other early traders noticed the pock-marked faces of older Sinixt and heard oral accounts of the epidemic. There is also evidence that the Sinixt were seriously affected by the major political upheavals that preceded the arrival of the Europeans.\\r\\nThe Ktunaxa (Kutenai) people who neighboured the Sinixt to the east were driven further into the mountains by the Blackfoot, who had obtained control of Ktunaxa territory in the foothills and northwestern plains. Ethnographic and historical evidence suggests the Ktunaxa and the Sinixt battled each other over the territory along the lower Kootenay River between the present cities of Nelson and Castlegar, British Columbia. The Ktunaxa were considered the intruders, and the dispute was reportedly ended after the Sinixt mounted a large-scale raid into (Lower) Ktunaxa Territory at the south end of Kootenay Lake. The Sinixt later renewed their historic peace with the Ktunaxa, and took common cause with them, the Kalispel, the Flathead, the Coeur d'Alene, the Spokane, the Nez Perce, and others against the Blackfoot. While the Sinixt never directly fought the Blackfoot as a group, it is very likely that individual Sinixt joined their Salishan neighbours (and the Ktunaxa) in war parties and buffalo hunts to the Western Plains. Reyes says they had ongoing skirmishes with the Blackfoot, from whom, according to him, they stole horses.[23] They also took part with other regional peoples in the punitive expedition in 1838 against the St'at'imc of Seton Lake led by Nicola (Hwistesmexteqen), chief of the Nicola people.[24] They were allied with the interior tribes led by the Nlaka'pamux, who assembled at Lytton (Camchin) during the Fraser Canyon War of 1858.[25]\\r\\nThe Sinixt and their allies had a very close relationship with the Hudson's Bay Company. They wintered near the major trading post at Colville for the first time in 1830-31, led by the Lower Sinixt chief See-Whel-Ken (died 1840).[26] The Sinixt supported the company in its efforts to prevent American trappers and settlers from entering and taking over the territory. As fur traders, the Sinixt were among the most prolific of all the First Nations who traded at Fort Colvile.\\r\\nIn 1837, Jesuit missionaries arrived in the area. St. Paul's Mission at Kettle Falls was constructed with the help of Colville and Sinixt labor. According to Reyes, it was in the 1840s that the Sinixt experienced a major die-off, shrinking from about 3,000 to about 400 during the period of chief Kin-Ka-Nawha, nephew of See-Whel-Ken. In addition to suffering diseases and incursions on their land, they found the salmon runs began to diminish because of the development of commercial fisheries at Astoria, Oregon near the mouth of the Columbia River. Some saw the die-off as a failure of the powers of their traditional religion; Kin-Ka-Nawha was among the eventual converts to Catholicism.[27]\\r\\nWhen the United States gained formal control of the Oregon Country south of the 49th Parallel in 1846, some Sinixt remained in American territory near Kettle Falls, where Fort Colville continued to operate. Kettle Falls (or just above it) was essentially the southern boundary of Sinixt Territory, and was shared with the Colville people. They were traditionally close to the Colville people, who celebrated the Sinixt arrival at the falls during fishing season with a three-day dance. The tribes had a three-day dance at the end of their season.\\r\\nIn the wake of the partition, the Hudson's Bay Company created Fort Shepherd, British Columbia, just upstream from the confluence of the Pend d'Oreille and Columbia Rivers, which was very near the border, in order to serve their former clients and also maintain a post on British territory. Adjacent Sinixt territory in British Columbia remained in the hands of the Sinixt. As late as the 1860s, Sinixt leaders still equated British title in their Northern territory as signifying Sinixt sovereignty. When Fort Shepherd was abandoned by the Hudson's Bay Company, for example, it was left in Sinixt hands.[28][29]\\r\\nProspectors began entering Sinixt territory in British Columbia in the 1850s and 1860s. Nevertheless, the Sinixt managed to maintain effective control over their northern traditional territory through the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, despite some conflict. While often accommodating white interests, they continued to claim ownership in British Columbia, and resisted the American miners, sometimes by force. In 1865, Sinixt blocked 200 miners and mining activities at the confluence of the Columbia and Kootenay rivers in an attempt to protect their hunting and fishing rights as promised by the Crown as related by Gold Commissioner J.C Haynes in a letter to the then acting colonial government in Victoria. Haynes reported in colonial correspondence that the local Indian (Sinixt) Chief expressed his grievances to mining in the region on at least two separate occasions and that the Hudson's Bay Company had promised royalties from mining in the area.[30]\\r\\nHowever, their reduced numbers resulted in the Sinixt being unable to control development of the area as it was flooded with miners during a second mineral rush in the 1880s and 1890s. Several boomtowns were erected throughout the West Kootenay and Boundary Country regions. The majority of Sinixt continued to live in Washington State on the Colville Reservation. Nevertheless, a number of Sinixt remained permanently in Canada during the first half of the 20th century. Many others also returned to their ancestral land in B.C., to hunt and fish during the summer months, well into the 20th Century.\\r\\nKin-Ka-Nawha resigned his role as chief as an old man. He was succeeded by Joseph Cotolegu, with Andrew Aorpaghan and James Bernard (c. 1870ÿ1935) as subchiefs. They would succeed him, in turn, as leaders.[31]\\r\\nOn the U.S. side, the Colville Confederated Tribesnow the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation  were formally established in 1872. They were forced to become wards of the government on the Colville Reservation. It was at this time that the name Sinixt or Sin Aikst was dropped in favor of Lakes, apparently at the behest of the U.S. government.[32]\\r\\nInitially, the Confederated Tribes were given a reservation east of the Columbia River. Three months later, it was taken away (because white settlers wanted it) and they were given a comparably large tract on the west side of the river on inferior land. Initially, this reservation extended all the way to the CanadaÿUS border, but the northern half was taken away in 1892, which separated it from Sinixt traditional territory in British Columbia; in addition, as more tribes lost their land, the shrinking reservation had to absorb yet more people.[33] Even then, they had to deal with incursions of miners, homesteaders, and settlers such as the Doukhobors, who arrived from Russia in 1912.[34]\\r\\nIn 1900, Aropaghan, over James Bernard's objection, agreed to have the land divided into individual allotments rather than held in common; he also agreed to include \\"half breeds\\" equally in the allocation.[35]\\r\\nBernard journeyed three times to Washington, D.C. on behalf of his people: first in 1890 as interpreter for Chief Smitkin of the Colvilles, then in 1900 with Chief Lot and Chief Barnaby to negotiate the reservation boundaries, and finally in 1921 as chair of a delegation of the Confederated Tribes.[36]\\r\\nUntil the construction of Grand Coulee Dam, the Lower Sinixt continued to fish in their traditional manner at Kettle Falls. They continued to elect a Salmon Chief. They fished with baskets on poles that caught the salmon who were not strong enough to clear the falls, and also with spears that had detachable tips, like a harpoon. Reyes sees this as the end of the traditional life of the Colville and Lakes: \\"After the concrete was poured into the steel framework to form the base of the dam, the great salmon runs ended.  It brought to a close a great tradition that had existed for centuries. From that day on there was always a shortage of food. The bands dispersed the great days of the Sin-Aikst were over.\\"[37] A few years later, rising waters from the dam also engulfed the largely Sinixt community of Inchelium, Washington on the banks of the Columbia, which had to be relocated, further disrupting even remnants of their traditional way of life.[38]\\r\\nIn her book, Keeping the Lakes Way, B.C. author Paula Pryce relates stories shared with her by Sinixt elders living in Washington State about visiting \\"the Northern Territory\\" from time to time after the extinction, \\"to pick berries, trade fish and visit sacred sites.\\"[39]\\r\\nA permanent Sinixt presence was re-established in British Columbia during the late 1980s when, following direction by an elder, a number of Sinixt descendants returned to the Slocan Valley to protest road building affecting an important village site, now called the Vallican Heritage Site. A bridge being built at Vallican resulted in a road being placed very near the large pithouse village and ancient burial site.[40] Since 1989, a permanent Sinixt presence continues in the Slocan Valley, with local members overseeing the repatriation of remains and playing an increasing role in local affairs. [40][41]\\r\\nPublication in the early 21st century of archaeological work has suggested the traditional society was complex. This is in line with historic, ethnographic, and contemporary Sinixt accounts of a socially and economically advanced society. Pithouses in the Slocan Valley are among the earliest very large houses of this type,[42] with some having diameters of over 20 metres (66?feet). The Slocan Narrows site also included some of the most recent very large pithouses. This and other evidence of a hierarchical and stratified society has led a leading scholar to state that the Sinixt's society was among the most complex of the entire region. Major hydroelectric projects along the Columbia and Kootenay rivers resulted in the flooding of many graveyards and the majority of Sinixt village sites, preventing excavation and study of these historic areas.\\r\\nThe Sinixt today live primarily on the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington, where they form part of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which has governmental recognition as an American Indian Tribe.\\r\\nPresently, few Sinixt live in their traditional territory on the \\"Canadian side\\" of the 49th parallel, and those who do so live in Vallican in the Slocan Valley, or scattered throughout neighbouring lands in the area now known as British Columbia. They are not recognized by the Canadian Government, and were officially declared \\"extinct\\" by Canada in 1956 under the provisions of the Indian Act. When asked about this extinction in 1995, Ron Irwin, then Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, stated that \\"The Arrow Lakes Band ceased to exist as a band for the purpose of the Indian Act... It does not, however, mean that the Sinixt ceased to exist as a tribal group.\\" (August 9, 1995).[1][43]\\r\\nThere were more than 250 Sinixt in Washington State at the time the Canadian Government declared the Sinixt extinct,[44] along with other self-identifying Sinixt who had relocated with relatives to the Canadian part of the Okanagan region, some Sinixt descendants had joined the Spallumcheen Indian Band (Splats'in First Nation) of the Secwepemc (Shuswap) peoples.\\r\\nMembers of Sinixt Nation have contested this extinction, and are taking steps to reclaim their land rights in British Columbia, where about 80% of their ancestral territory lies. Further complicating the question of Canadian territory claimed by the Sinixt are the overlapping claims of Ktunaxa traditional territory. The Ktunaxa Kinbasket Treaty Council is currently negotiating a treaty with the Canadian Federal Government and the British Columbia Provincial government in the region, particularly regarding the lower Kootenay River valley around Castlegar and Nelson, and all lands within the curve of the Columbia as far north as Mica Dam and all of the Slocan Valley.[45][46] In a 1994 presentation to the United Nations, Sinixt Appointed Spokesperson Marilyn James, along with the Official Vallican Heritage Site Caretaker, Robert Watt stated that \\"Neither our ancestors nor the members of Sinixt Nation have ever relinquished our inherent rights to any individual, any government or any other organization, including other native tribes or native nations.[47]\\r\\nSimilar to the conflicting Ktunaxa land claims, territorial claims shown on maps published by the Okanagan Nation Alliance, of which the Colville Tribes is the American-side member, do not show Sinixt territory, instead showing the region as part of Okanagan traditional territory.[48]\\r\\nOn July 28, 2008, \\"directors of the Sinixt Nation Society have filed a lawsuit claiming aboriginal title to Crown land in the Kootenays.\\"[49] Their lawyer David Aaron describes the intent of the action as \\"asserting a right (for the Sinixt) to be consulted, and to consent to all uses or dispositions of Crown land within that territory,\\" and notes that private lands in the area will not be affected by the claim.[50]\\r\\nMany Lakes (Sinixt) feel that to live ethically one must follow a moral code which maintains a reciprocal relationship between humans, the land, and the realm of spirits in which the ancestors dwell. (Ancestor) Eva Orr called this 'keeping the Lakes' way.' The ideal of keeping the Lakes' way requires that people not take for their own gain but instead give back by following a cultural ethic of egalitarianism, reciprocity and peaceful living.[51] Orr was acknowledged as spiritual leader ÿ a klakwilt. Marilyn James states that Orr got her authority as a klakwilt by being culturally whole, linguistically connected to Sinixt culture, and bringing people to spirit.[52] The Sinixt connection to their traditional territory is underscored by the wbuplak'n, the highest territorial and cultural legal doctrine of the Sinixt, which sets out their territorial responsibility to all land, water, plant, animal and cultural resources within the Sinixt territory.[53]\\r\\nSinixt in the group's northern territory host a bi-weekly radio program, Sinixt Radio, on Nelson, B.C. Community Radio station CJLY-FM. The northern Sinixt also host an annual Barter Fair every fall in Vallican, B.C. The event features live music and performance, and it is set up to encourage local Bartering of goods and services.\\r\\nOn 27 March 2017, the Provincial Court of British Columbia ruled in favor of Sinixt member Rick DeSautel, a resident of the Colville reservation, over a dispute with Canadian authorities on hunting in Canadian territory. The ruling effectively recognized the Sinixt as having rights in Canada, despite being declared extinct in 1956.[1]\\r\\nIn Washington, one particular family of Sinixt have figured prominently among recent-day \\"urban Indians\\". Bernie Whitebear (1937ÿ2000), a Seattle Indian rights activist and founder of several \\"urban Indian\\" organizations, was declared Washington state's \\"First Citizen of the Decade\\" in November 1997;[54] his sister Luana Reyes (19332001) was, at the time of her death, deputy director of the U.S.'s 14,000-person Indian Health Services;[55] and their brother Lawney Reyes (b. c.1931) is a Seattle-based sculptor, designer, curator and author.[3] Lawney Luana and Bernie are descendants of Alex Christian, whose family lived at Kp'itl'els (Brilliant, B.C., near present-day Castlegar), a Sinixt village, for generations, until the Canadian Government sold their land to settlers.[56]\\r\\nNovelist and memoirist Okanagan Mourning Dove, also known as Christine Quintasket, is described by anthropologist Paula Pryce as being of Sinixt-Skoyelpi descent, and Quintasket described her childhood and youth at Pia (now Kelly Hill, Washington) in the late 19th/early 20th century.[57] Quintasket (Humishuma) was one of the first Native American women to publish a novel.[58]\\r\\nJoe Feddersen is a Sinixt/Okanagan sculptor, painter, photographer and mixed-media artist born in Omak, Washington.","input":"What area is considered the traditional lands of the sinixt tribe?"},{"output":"the late 1970s","context":"Lay's is the name of a brand for a number of potato chip varieties, as well as the name of the company that founded the chip brand in the U.S. in 1932.

The rankings are compiled by polling 65 sportswriters and broadcasters from across the nation.[1] Each voter provides his own ranking of the top 25 teams, and the individual rankings are then combined to produce the national ranking by giving a team 25 points for a first place vote, 24 for a second place vote, and so on down to 1 point for a twenty-fifth place vote. Ballots of the voting members in the AP Poll are made public.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe football poll is released Sundays at 2pm Eastern time during the football season, unless ranked teams have not finished their games.\\r\\nThe AP college football poll has a long history. The news media began running their own polls of sports writers to determine who was, by popular opinion, the best football team in the country at the end of the season. One of the earliest such polls was the AP College Football Poll, first run in 1934.[3] In 1935, AP sports editor Alan J. Gould declared a three way tie for national champion in football between Minnesota, Princeton, and Southern Methodist. Minnesota fans protested, and a number of Gould's colleagues led by Charles \\"Cy\\" Sherman suggested he create a poll of sports editors instead of only using his own list, and the next year the poll was born.[4] It has run continuously from 1936.[5]\\r\\nDue to the long-standing historical ties between individual college football conferences and high-paying bowl games like the Rose Bowl and Orange Bowl, the NCAA had not held a tournament or championship game to determine the champion of what is now the highest division, NCAA Division I, Football Bowl Subdivision (the Division I, Football Championship Subdivision and lower divisions do hold championship tournaments). As a result, the public and the media began to acknowledge the leading vote-getter in the final AP Poll as the national champion for that season.\\r\\nWhile the AP Poll currently lists the Top 25 teams in the nation, from 1936 to 1961 the wire service only ranked 20 teams. From 1962 to 1967 only 10 teams were recognized. From 1968 to 1988, the AP again resumed its Top 20 before expanding to the current 25 teams in 1989.\\r\\nThe AP began conducting a preseason poll starting in 1950.[6][7]\\r\\nAt the end of the 1947 season the AP released an unofficial post-bowl poll which differed from the regular season final poll.[8] Until the 1968 college football season, the final AP poll of the season was released following the end of the regular season, with the lone exception of the 1965 season. In 1964, Alabama was named the national champion in the final AP Poll following the completion of the regular season, but lost in the Orange Bowl to Texas, leaving Arkansas as the only undefeated, untied team after the Razorbacks defeated Nebraska in the Cotton Bowl Classic. In 1965, the AP's decision to wait to crown its champion paid handsomely, as top-ranked Michigan State lost to UCLA in the Rose Bowl, number two Arkansas lost to LSU in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and fourth-ranked Alabama defeated third-ranked Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, vaulting the Crimson Tide to the top of the AP's final poll (Michigan State was named national champion in the final UPI Coaches Poll, which did not conduct a post-bowl poll).\\r\\nBeginning in the 1968 season, the post bowl game poll became permanent and the AP championship reflected the bowl game results. The UPI did not follow suit with the coaches' poll until the 1974 season.\\r\\nAs of the completion of the 2015 season the number one ranked team has faced the number two ranked team 50 times since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936.[9] The number one team has a record of 28ÿ20ÿ2 against the number two team.[9]\\r\\nIn 1997, the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) was developed to try to unify the poll results by picking two teams for a \\"real\\" national championship game. For the first several years the AP Poll factored in the determination of the BCS rankings, along with other factors including the Coaches Poll and computer-based polls. Because of a series of controversies surrounding the BCS, the AP demanded in December, 2004, that its poll no longer be used in the BCS rankings,[10] and so the 2004ÿ2005 season was the last season that the AP Poll was used for this purpose.\\r\\nIn the 2003 season the BCS system broke down when the final BCS standings ranked the University of Southern California (USC) at No. 3 while the two human polls in the system had ranked USC at No. 1. As a result, USC did not play in the BCS' designated national championship game. After defeating another highly ranked team, Michigan, in its final game, the AP Poll kept USC at No. 1 while the Coaches Poll was contractually obligated to select the winner of the BCS game, Louisiana State University (LSU), as the No. 1 team. The resulting split national title was the very problem that the BCS was created to solve, and has been widely considered an embarrassment.[11]\\r\\nIn 2004, a new controversy erupted at the end of the season when Auburn and Utah, who both finished the regular season 12ÿ0, were left out of the BCS title game in favor of Oklahoma who also was 12ÿ0 and had won decisively over Colorado in the Big 12 Championship game. USC went on to a win easily over Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl while Auburn and Utah both won their bowl games, leaving three undefeated teams at the end of the season. Also, in that same year, Texas made up late ground on California (Cal) in the BCS standings and as a result grabbed a high-payout, at-large spot in the Rose Bowl. Previous to that poll, Cal had been ranked ahead of Texas in both human polls and the BCS poll. Going into their final game, the Golden Bears were made aware that while margin of victory did not affect computer rankings, it did affect human polls and just eight voters changing their vote could affect the final standings.[12] Both teams won their game that week, but the Texas coach, Mack Brown, had made a public effort to lobby for his team to be moved higher in the ranking. When the human polls were released, Texas remained behind Cal, but it had closed the gap enough so that the BCS poll (which determines placement) placed Texas above Cal, angering both Cal and its conference, the Pac-10.[13] The final poll positions had been unchanged with Cal at No. 4 AP, No. 4 coaches, and No. 6 computers polls and Texas at No. 6 AP, No. 5 coaches, and No. 4 computer polls.[13] The AP Poll voters were caught in the middle because their vote changes were automatically made public, while the votes of the Coaches poll were kept confidential. Although there had been a more substantial shift in the votes of the Coaches Poll, the only clear targets for the ire of fanatical fans were the voters in the AP Poll. While officials from both Cal and the Pac-10 called for the coaches' votes to be made public, the overtures were turned down and did little to solve the problem of AP voters. Cal went on to lose to Texas Tech in the Holiday Bowl. Texas defeated Michigan in the Rose Bowl.\\r\\nMany members of the press who voted in the AP Poll were upset by the controversy and, at the behest of its members, the AP asked that its poll no longer be used in the BCS rankings. The 2004 season was the last season that the AP Poll was used in the BCS rankings, it was replaced in the BCS equation by the newly created Harris Interactive College Football Poll.[14]\\r\\nThe AP Poll is not the only college football poll. The other major poll is the Coaches Poll, which has been sponsored by several organizations: the United Press (1950ÿ1957), the United Press International (1958ÿ1990), USA Today (1991ÿpresent), CNN (1991ÿ1996), and ESPN (1997ÿ2005). Having two major polls has led to numerous \\"split\\" national titles, where the two polls disagreed on the No. 1 team. This has occurred on eleven different occasions (1954, 1957, 1965, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1990, 1991, 1997, 2003).\\r\\nIn Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll are invited to the men's and women's NCAA basketball tournament, also known as March Madness. The poll is usually released every Monday and voters' ballots are made public.[15]\\r\\nThe AP began compiling a ranking of the top 20 college men's basketball teams during the 1948ÿ1949 season. It has issued this poll continuously since the 1950ÿ1951 season. As of January 2018, UCLA and Duke are tied for the most appearances atop the rankings at 134 times.[16]\\r\\nThe women's basketball poll began during the 1976ÿ1977 season, and was initially compiled by Mel Greenberg and published by The Philadelphia Inquirer. At first, it was a poll of coaches conducted via telephone, where coaches identified top teams and a list of the Top 20 team was produced. The initial list of coaches did not include Pat Summitt, who asked to join the group, not to improve her rankings, but because of the lack of media coverage, Summitt believed it would be a good way to stay on top of who the top teams were outside of her own schedule.[17] The contributors continued to be coaches until 1994, when the AP took over administration of the poll from Greenberg, and switched to a panel of writers.[18] In 1994, Tennessee started out as No. 1 in the polls with Connecticut at No. 4. After losses by the No. 2 and No. 3 teams, Tennessee and Connecticut were ranked No. 1 and No. 2, headed into a showdown, scheduled as a special event on Martin Luther King day, the only women's basketball game scheduled on that day. Because of the unusual circumstances, the decision was made to hold off the AP voting for one day, to ensure it would be after the game. Connecticut won the game, and moved into first place in the AP poll, published on Tuesday for the only time. (Connecticut went on to complete an undefeated season.)[19] Over the history of the poll, over 255 coaches have had a team represented in polls.[20]\\r\\nBeginning in 2012, the AP began issuing a weekly pro football ranking, the AP Pro32 rankings.[21]","input":"When is the ap college football poll released?"},{"output":"18 November 2011","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish game developer Markus Persson and later developed by Mojang.[g] The game allows players to build with a variety of different cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple gameplay modes are available, including a survival mode in which the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players can play custom maps created by other players with certain restrictions, a spectator mode where players can freely move throughout a world without being affected by gravity or collisions, and a hardcore mode, where the player is given only one life. The PC version of the game allows players to create mods with new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft received critical acclaim and has won numerous awards and accolades. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the MineCon convention played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. By early 2018, over 144 million copies had been sold across all platforms, making it the second best-selling video game of all time behind Tetris. In September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to buy Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion, with the acquisition completed two months later. Spin-off games, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, have also been released. By the end of 2017, the game had over 74 million monthly active players.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[17] However, there is an achievement system.[18] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective.[19] The game world is composed of rough 3D objectsmainly cubes and fluidsrepresenting various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can \\"mine\\" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player).[21][22][23] There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane, only running into technical problems when extremely distant locations are reached.[nb 1] The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller sections called \\"chunks\\" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby.[21] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields;[24][25] the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and various lava/water bodies.[23] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, and one full cycle lasts 20 real-time minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures.[26] Passive mobs can be hunted for food and crafting materials, such as cows, pigs, and chickens. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as cavesincluding large spiders, skeletons, and zombies.[23] Some hostile mobs, such as zombies and skeletons, burn under the sun.[27] Some creatures unique to Minecraft have been noted by reviewers, including the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport and pick up blocks).[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.[29] Liquids continuously flow for a limited horizontal distance from source blocks, which can be removed by placing a solid block in its place or by scooping it into a bucket. Complex systems can be built using primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates built with an in-game material known as redstone.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the main world: the Nether and the End.[28] The Nether is a hell-like dimension accessed via player-built portals; it contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the overworld.[31] The player can build an optional boss mob called the Wither out of materials found in the Nether.[32] The End is a barren land consisting of many islands. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon dwells on the main island.[33] Killing the dragon cues the game's ending credits, written by Irish novelist Julian Gough.[34] Players are then allowed to teleport back to their original spawn point in the overworld and continue the game indefinitely.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game consists of five game modes: survival, creative, adventure, hardcore, and spectator. It also has a changeable difficulty system of four levels. For example, the peaceful difficulty prevents hostile creatures from spawning, and when playing on the hard difficulty players can starve to death if their hunger bar is depleted.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.[23] Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night.[23] The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from monsters, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game, except in peaceful difficulty. If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete.[37] Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft.[38] Players can craft armour, which can help mitigate damage from attacks, while weapons such as swords can be crafted to kill enemies and other animals more easily. Players acquire resources to craft tools, such as axes, shovels, or pickaxes, used to chop down trees, dig soil, and mine ores, respectively; e.g. tools made of iron perform their tasks more quickly than tools made of stone or wood and can be used more heavily before they break. Players can construct furnaces which can smelt food, process ores and materials, among others.[39] Players may also trade goods with villager NPCs through a bartering system involving trading emeralds for different goods, and vice versa.[40][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game has an inventory system, and players can carry a limited number of items. Upon dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped, and players re-spawn at their spawn point, which is set by default where players begin the game, and can be reset if players sleep in a bed.[41] Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they despawn. Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food. Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armour and weapons.[36] Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nHardcore mode is a survival mode variant that is locked to the hardest setting and has permadeath, which permanently deletes the world if the player dies.[42] If a player dies on a multiplayer server set to hardcore, they are put into spectator mode.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn creative mode, players have access to all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu, and can place or remove them instantly.[44] Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger.[45][46] The game mode helps players focus on building and creating large projects.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure mode was added to Minecraft in version 1.3; it was designed specifically so that players could experience user-crafted custom maps and adventures.[47][48][49] Gameplay is similar to survival mode but introduces various player restrictions, which can be applied to the game world by the creator of the map. This forces players to obtain the required items and experience adventures in the way that the map maker intended.[49] Another addition designed for custom maps is the command block; this block allows map makers to expand interactions with players through scripted server commands.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpectator mode allows players to fly around through blocks and watch gameplay without directly interacting. In this mode, instead of having an inventory, players have the ability to teleport to other players. It is also possible to view from the perspective of another player or creature.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiplayer in Minecraft is available through direct game-to-game multiplayer, LAN play, local split screen, and servers (player-hosted and business-hosted). It enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world.[52] Players can run their own servers, use a hosting provider, or connect directly to another player's game via Xbox Live. Single-player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join a world on locally interconnected computers without a server setup.[53] Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators (op for short), who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players. Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed to enter the server.[52] Multiplayer servers have a wide range of activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs. Player versus player combat (PvP) can be enabled to allow fighting between players.[54] Many servers have custom plugins that allow actions that are not normally possible. In 2013, Mojang announced Minecraft Realms, a server hosting service intended to enable players to run server multiplayer games easily and safely without having to set up their own.[55] Unlike a standard server, only invited players can join Realms servers, and these servers do not use IP addresses. Minecraft: Java Edition Realms server owners can invite up to twenty people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at a time. Minecraft Realms server owners can invite up to 3000 people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at one time. [56] The Minecraft: Java Edition Realms servers do not support user-made plugins, but players can play custom Minecraft maps.[57] Minecraft Realms servers support user-made add-ons, resource packs, behavior packs, and custom Minecraft maps. [58] At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, it was announced that Realms would enable Minecraft to support cross-platform play between Windows 10, iOS, and Android platforms starting in June 2016,[59] with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch support to come later in 2017,[60] and support for virtual reality devices. On 31 July 2017, Mojang released the beta version of the update allowing cross-platform play.[61] Realms also supports the Xbox One, Windows 10, Android, iOS, and Kindle platforms.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkus \\"Notch\\" Persson began developing the game as a project.[63] He was inspired to create Minecraft by several other games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and later Infiniminer. At the time, he had visualised an isometric 3D building game that would be a cross between his inspirations and had made some early prototypes.[63] Infiniminer heavily influenced the style of gameplay, including the first-person aspect of the game, the \\"blocky\\" visual style and the block-building fundamentals. However, unlike Infiniminer, Persson wanted Minecraft to have RPG elements.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft was first released to the public on 17 May 2009, as a developmental release on TIGSource forums,[65] later becoming known as the Classic version. Further milestones dubbed as Survival Test, Indev and Infdev were released between September 2009 and February 2010, although the game saw updates in-between. The first major update, dubbed alpha version, was released on 28 June 2010. Although Persson maintained a day job with Jalbum.net at first, he later quit in order to work on Minecraft full-time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded.[66] Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically. These updates included new items, new blocks, new mobs, survival mode, and changes to the game's behaviour (e.g. how water flows).[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo back the development of Minecraft, Persson set up a video game company, Mojang, with the money earned from the game.[67][68][69] On 11 December 2010, Persson announced that Minecraft was entering its beta testing phase on 20 December 2010. He further stated that bug fixes and all updates leading up to and including the release would still be free.[70] Over the course of the development, Mojang hired several new employees to work on the project.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nMojang moved the game out of beta and released the full version on 18 November 2011.[72] The game has been continuously updated since the release, with changes ranging from new game content to new server hosts.[73] On 1 December 2011, Jens \\"Jeb\\" Bergensten took full creative control over Minecraft, replacing Persson as lead developer.[74] On 28 February 2012, Mojang announced that they had hired the developers of the popular server platform \\"CraftBukkit\\"[54] to improve Minecraft's support of server modifications.[75] This acquisition also included Mojang apparently taking full ownership of the CraftBukkit modification,[76] although the validity of this claim was questioned due to its status as an open-source project with many contributors, licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser General Public License.[77] On 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion deal to buy Mojang, along with the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property. The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for \\"trying to do the right thing\\".[78][79] It was completed on 6 November 2014, and led to Persson becoming one of Forbes' \\"World's Billionaires\\".[80][81][82][83]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft's music and sound effects were produced by German musician C418 (Daniel Rosenfeld).[84] The background music in Minecraft is instrumental ambient music. On 4 March 2011, Rosenfeld released a soundtrack, titled Minecraft ÿ Volume Alpha; it includes most of the tracks featured in Minecraft, as well as other music not featured in the game.[85] The video game blog Kotaku chose the music in Minecraft as one of the best video game soundtracks of 2011.[86] On 9 November 2013, Rosenfeld released the second official soundtrack, titled Minecraft ÿ Volume Beta, which includes the music that was added in later versions of the game.[87][88] A physical release of Volume Alpha, consisting of CDs, black vinyl, and limited-edition transparent green vinyl LPs, was issued by acclaimed indie electronic label Ghostly International on 21 August 2015.[89][90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game can run on multiple operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.[52][91] Apart from Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft for Windows 10, there are other versions of Minecraft for PC, including Minecraft Classic, Minecraft 4k, and Minecraft: Education Edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft Classic is an older version of Minecraft that was first available online and can currently be played through the launcher. Unlike newer versions of Minecraft, the classic version is free to play, though it is no longer updated. It functions much the same as creative mode, allowing players to build and destroy any and all parts of the world either alone or in a multiplayer server. There are no computer creatures in this mode, and environmental hazards such as lava do not damage players. Some blocks function differently since their behaviour was later changed during development.[92][93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft 4k is a simplified version of Minecraft similar to the classic version that was developed for the Java 4K game programming contest \\"in way less than 4 kilobytes\\".[95] The map itself is finitecomposed of 64G64G64 blocksand the same world is generated every time. Players are restricted to placing or destroying blocks, which consist of grass, dirt, stone, wood, leaves, and brick.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft: Education Edition is a version of Minecraft created specifically for educational institutions and was launched 1 November 2016. [97] It includes a Chemistry Resource Pack [98], free lesson plans on the Minecraft Education website, and two free companion applications: Code Connection and Classroom Mode.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft for Windows 10 is currently exclusive to Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system. The beta for it launched on the Windows Store on 29 July 2015.[100] This version has the ability to play with Xbox Live friends, and to play local multiplayer with owners of Minecraft on mobile platforms. Other features include the ability to use multiple control schemes, such as a gamepad, keyboard, or touchscreen (for Microsoft Surface and other touchscreen-enabled devices), virtual reality support, and to record and take screenshots in-game via the built-in GameDVR.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Xbox 360 version of the game, developed by 4J Studios, was released on 9 May 2012.[102][103] On 22 March 2012, it was announced that Minecraft would be the flagship game in a new Xbox Live promotion called Arcade NEXT.[103] The game differs from the home computer versions in a number of ways, including a newly designed crafting system, the control interface, in-game tutorials, split-screen multiplayer, and the ability to play with friends via Xbox Live.[104][105] The worlds in the Xbox 360 version are also not \\"infinite\\", and are essentially barricaded by invisible walls.[105] The Xbox 360 version was originally similar in content to older PC versions, but is being gradually updated to bring it closer to the current PC version.[102][106][107] An Xbox One version featuring larger worlds among other enhancements[108] was released on 5 September 2014.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nVersions of the game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 were released on 17 December 2013 and 4 September 2014 respectively.[7] The PlayStation 4 version was announced as a launch title, though it was eventually delayed.[109][110] A version for PS Vita was also released in October 2014.[111] Like the Xbox versions, the PlayStation versions were developed by 4J Studios.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 2015, Minecraft: Wii U Edition was released. The Wii U version received a physical release on 17 June 2016 in North America,[113] in Japan on 23 June 2016,[114] and in Europe on 30 June 2016.[115] A Nintendo Switch version of the game was released on the Nintendo eShop on 11 May 2017, along with a physical retail version set for a later date.[116] During a Nintendo Direct presentation on 13 September 2017, Nintendo announced that Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition would be available for download immediately after the livestream, and a physical copy available on a later date. The game is only compatible with the \\"New\\" versions of the 3DS and 2DS systems, and does not work with the original 3DS, 3DS XL, or 2DS models.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 August 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Xperia Play on the Android Market as an early alpha version. It was then released for several other compatible devices on 8 October 2011.[117][118] An iOS version of Minecraft was released on 17 November 2011.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nA port was made available for Windows Phones shortly after Microsoft acquired Mojang.[120] The port concentrates on the creative building and the primitive survival aspect of the game, and does not contain all the features of the PC release. On his Twitter account, Jens Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is written in C++ and not Java, due to iOS not being able to support Java.[121] Gradual updates are periodically released to bring the port closer to the PC version.[122] On 10 December 2014, in observance of Mojang's acquisition by Microsoft, a port of Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1.[123] On 18 January 2017, Microsoft announced that it would no longer maintain the Windows Phone versions of Pocket Edition.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2014, a version of Minecraft based on the Pocket Edition was released for the Amazon Fire.[125] On 29 July 2015, a version of Minecraft based on the Pocket Edition was released for Windows 10.[126] On 19 December 2016, the full version of Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released on iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows 10, along with the release of the game based on the Pocket Edition for the Apple TV.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 31 July 2017, the Pocket Edition portion of the name was dropped and the apps were renamed to Minecraft.[127]. The mobile version of Minecraft was renamed to the Bedrock Edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nA version of Minecraft for the Raspberry Pi was officially revealed at MineCon 2012. Mojang stated that the Pi Edition is similar to the Pocket Edition except that it is downgraded to an older version, and with the added ability of using text commands to edit the game world. Players can open the game code and use programming languages to manipulate things in the game world.[128] The game was leaked on 20 December 2012, but was quickly pulled off.[129] It was officially released on 11 February 2013.[130] It was announced that there would be no further updates for this version in 2016.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly on, Persson planned to support the Oculus Rift with a port of Minecraft, however after Facebook acquired Oculus in 2013 he abruptly canceled plans noting \\"Facebook creeps me out.\\"[132][133] A community-made modification known as Minecraft VR was developed in 2016 to provide virtual reality support to Minecraft: Java Edition oriented towards Oculus Rift hardware. A fork of the Minecraft VR modification known as Vivecraft ported the mod to OpenVR, and is oriented towards supporting HTC Vive hardware.[134] On 15 August 2016, Microsoft launched official Oculus Rift support for Minecraft on Windows 10.[134] Upon its release, the Minecraft VR mod was discontinued by its developer due to trademark complaints issued by Microsoft, and Vivecraft was endorsed by the community makers of the Minecraft VR modification due to its Rift support and being superior to the original Minecraft VR mod.[134] Also available is a Gear VR version, titled Minecraft: Gear VR Edition.[135] Windows Mixed Reality support was added in 2017. The only officially supported VR versions of Minecraft are Minecraft: Gear VR Edition and Minecraft on Windows 10 for Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nA wide variety of user-generated downloadable content for Minecraft, such as modifications, texture packs and custom maps, exists and is available on the Internet. Modifications of the Minecraft code, called mods, add a variety of gameplay changes, ranging from new blocks, new items, new mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms to craft.[137][138] The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay, such as minimaps, waypoints, and durability counters, to ones that add to the game elements from Pokmon, Portal, and The Hunger Games. To make mods easier to create and install, Mojang announced in November 2012 that it planned to add an official modding application programming interface (API).[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nTexture packs that alter the game's textures and HUD are also available, as created by the community.[139] In July 2013, texture packs were replaced with \\"resource packs\\", which have the same role as texture packs, but allow custom audio as well.[140] Players are also create their own maps, which often contain specific rules, challenges, puzzles and quests, and share them for others to play.[47] In August 2012, Mojang added adventure mode[48] for custom maps and in October 2012, Mojang added command blocks,[50] which were created specially for custom maps. In February 2016, Mojang added 2 new versions (Repeat, and Chain) of the classic command block, which were also created specifically for custom maps.[141][142]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Xbox 360 Edition supports downloadable content, which is available to purchase via the Xbox Games Store; these content packs usually contain additional character skins.[143] It later received support for texture packs in its twelfth title update while introducing \\"mash-up packs\\", which combines texture packs with skin packs and changes to the game's sounds, music and user interface.[144] The first mash-up pack (and by extension, the first texture pack) for the Xbox 360 Edition was released on 4 September 2013, and was themed after the Mass Effect franchise.[145] Unlike the PC version, however, the Xbox 360 Edition does not support player-made mods or custom maps.[146] A cross-promotional resource pack based on the Super Mario franchise by Nintendo was released for the Wii U Edition worldwide on 17 May 2016.[147] A mash-up pack based on Fallout was announced for release on the Wii U Edition.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2017, Mojang released an update known as the \\"Discovery Update\\".[149] The update includes a new map, a new game mode, the \\"Marketplace\\", a catalogue of user-generated content that gives Minecraft creators \\"another way to make a living from the game\\", and more.[150][151]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft: Story Mode, an episodic spin-off game developed by Telltale Games in collaboration with Mojang, was announced in December 2014. Consisting of five episodes plus three additional downloadable episodes, the standalone game is a narrative and player choice-driven, and it was released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, iOS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One via download on 13 October 2015.[152][153][154] A physical disc that grants access to all episodes was released for the aforementioned four consoles on 27 October.[154] Wii U [155] and Nintendo Switch version were also later released [156][157] The first trailer for the game was shown at MineCon on 4 July 2015, revealing some of the game's features. In Minecraft: Story Mode, players control Jesse (voiced by Patton Oswalt and Catherine Taber),[154] who sets out on a journey with his or her friends to find The Order of the Stonefour adventurers who slayed an Ender Dragonin order to save their world. Brian Posehn, Ashley Johnson, Scott Porter, Martha Plimpton, Dave Fennoy, Corey Feldman, Billy West and Paul Reubens portray the rest of the cast.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2016, Microsoft announced a new tool for education, called Minecraft: Education Edition, which was released on 1 November 2016. Minecraft has already been used in classrooms around the world to teach subjects ranging from core STEM topics to arts and poetry. Minecraft: Education Edition is designed specifically for classroom use. The Education Edition gives teachers the tools they need to use Minecraft on an everyday basis.[159][160]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are few differences between regular Minecraft and the Education Edition. The main concept is the same ÿ the game is an open sandbox world. The students' characters in Education Edition are able to retain characteristics. Students are be able to download the game at home, without having to buy their own version of the game. The last large difference is that students can take in-game photos with a camera item. These photos are stored in an online notebook with the students' online notes. These online notebooks can be shared with other students.[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation Edition has brought some partnerships from other traditional publishers to bring educational content within the game. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt developed a full version of The Oregon Trail within Education Edition, keeping the entirety of the original game while adding other educational activities alongside it.[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsers who play the Bedrock (or cross-play) edition can activate Education Edition features in the options section of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft received critical acclaim, praising the creative freedom it grants players in-game, as well as the ease of enabling emergent gameplay.[184][185][186] Critics have praised Minecraft's complex crafting system, commenting that it is an important aspect of the game's open-ended gameplay.[176] Most publications were impressed by the game's \\"blocky\\" graphics, with IGN describing them as \\"instantly memorable\\".[17] Reviewers also liked the game's adventure elements, noting that the game creates a good balance between exploring and building.[176] The game's multiplayer feature has been generally received favourably, with IGN commenting that \\"adventuring is always better with friends\\".[17] Jaz McDougall of PC Gamer commended Minecraft, deeming it \\"intuitively interesting and contagiously fun, with an unparalleled scope for creativity and memorable experiences\\".[183] It has been regarded as having introduced millions of children to the digital world, insofar as its basic game mechanics are logically analogous to computer commands.\\r\\n[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nReviewers have said the game's lack of in-game tutorials and instructions make it difficult for new players to learn how to play the game. IGN was disappointed about the troublesome steps needed to set up multiplayer servers, calling it a \\"hassle\\".[17] Critics also said visual glitches that occur periodically.[176] In 2009, GameSpot said the game has an \\"unfinished feel\\", adding that \\"some game elements seem incomplete or thrown together in haste\\".[176]\\r\\n\\r\\nA review of the alpha version, by Scott Munro of the Daily Record, called it \\"already something special\\" and urged readers to buy it.[188] Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun also recommended the alpha of the game, calling it \\"a kind of generative 8-bit Lego Stalker\\".[189] On 17 September 2010, gaming webcomic Penny Arcade began a series of comics and news posts about the addictiveness of the game.[190]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Xbox 360 version was generally received positively by critics, but did not receive as much praise as the PC version. Although reviewers were disappointed by the lack of features such as mod support and content from the PC version, they acclaimed the port's addition of a tutorial and in-game tips and crafting recipes, saying that they make the game more user-friendly.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft: Pocket Edition initially received mixed reviews from critics. Although reviewers appreciated the game's intuitive controls, they were disappointed by the lack of content. The inability to collect resources and craft items, as well as the limited types of blocks and lack of hostile mobs, were especially criticised.[178][191][192] After updates adding more content, Pocket Edition started receiving more positive reviews. Reviewers complimented the controls and the graphics, but still noted a lack of content.[178]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft surpassed over a million purchases less than a month after entering its beta phase in early 2011.[193][194] At the same time, the game had no publisher backing and has never been commercially advertised except through word of mouth,[195] and various unpaid references in popular media such as the Penny Arcade webcomic.[196] By April 2011, Persson estimated that Minecraft had made ?23?million (US$33?million) in revenue, with 800,000 sales of the alpha version of the game, and over 1 million sales of the beta version.[197] In November 2011, prior to the game's full release, Minecraft beta surpassed 16 million registered users and 4 million purchases.[198] By March 2012, Minecraft had become the 6th best-selling PC game of all time.[199] As of  10?October?2014[update], the game has sold 17 million copies on PC, becoming the best-selling PC game of all time.[200] As of  10?October?2014[update], the game has sold approximately 60 million copies across all platforms, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time.[200][201] On 25 February 2014, the game reached 100 million registered users.[202] As of  January?2018[update], over 144 million copies had been sold across all platforms,[203] making it the second best-selling video game of all time behind Tetris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Xbox 360 version of Minecraft became profitable within the first day of the game's release in 2012, when the game broke the Xbox Live sales records with 400,000 players online.[204] Within a week of being on the Xbox Live Marketplace, Minecraft sold upwards of a million copies.[205] GameSpot announced in December 2012 that Minecraft sold over 4.48 million copies since the game debuted on Xbox Live Arcade in May 2012.[206] In 2012, Minecraft was the most purchased title on Xbox Live Arcade; it was also the fourth most played title on Xbox Live based on average unique users per day.[207] As of  4?April?2014[update], the Xbox 360 version has sold 12 million copies.[208] In addition, Minecraft: Pocket Edition has reached a figure of 21 million in sales.[209] The PlayStation 3 version sold one million copies in five weeks.[210] The release of the game's PlayStation Vita version boosted Minecraft sales by 79%, outselling both PS3 and PS4 debut releases and becoming the largest Minecraft launch on a PlayStation console.[211] The PS Vita version sold 100,000 digital copies in Japan within the first two months of release, according to an announcement by SCE Japan Asia.[212] By January 2015, 500,000 digital copies of Minecraft were sold in Japan across all PlayStation platforms, with a surge in primary school children purchasing the PS Vita version.[213] Minecraft helped improve Microsoft's total first-party revenue by $63 million for the 2015 second quarter.[214]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2010, PC Gamer listed Minecraft as the fourth-best game to play at work.[215] In December of that year, Good Game selected Minecraft as their choice for Best Downloadable Game of 2010,[216] Gamasutra named it the eighth best game of the year as well as the eighth best indie game of the year,[217][218] and Rock, Paper, Shotgun named it the \\"game of the year\\".[219] Indie DB awarded the game the 2010 Indie of the Year award as chosen by voters, in addition to two out of five Editor's Choice awards for Most Innovative and Best Singleplayer Indie.[220] It was also awarded Game of the Year by PC Gamer UK.[221] The game was nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Technical Excellence, and Excellence in Design awards at the March 2011 Independent Games Festival and won the Grand Prize and the community-voted Audience Award.[222][223] At Game Developers Choice Awards 2011, Minecraft won awards in the categories for Best Debut Game, Best Downloadable Game and Innovation Award, winning every award for which it was nominated.[224][225] It also won GameCity's video game arts award.[226] On 5 May 2011, Minecraft was selected as one of the 80 games that would be displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum as part of The Art of Video Games exhibit that opened on 16 March 2012.[227][228] At the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, Minecraft won the award for Best Independent Game and was nominated in the Best PC Game category.[229][230] In 2012, at the British Academy Video Games Awards, Minecraft was nominated in the GAME Award of 2011 category and Persson received The Special Award.[231] In 2012, Minecraft XBLA was awarded a Golden Joystick Award in the Best Downloadable Game category,[232] and a TIGA Games Industry Award in the Best Arcade Game category.[233] In 2013 it was nominated as the family game of the year at the British Academy Video Games Awards.[234] Minecraft Console Edition won the award for TIGA Game Of The Year in 2014.[235] In 2015, the game placed 6th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.[236] In 2016, Minecraft placed 6th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list.[237]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft was nominated for the 2013 Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite App, but lost to Temple Run.[238] It was nominated for the 2014 Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Video Game, but lost to Just Dance 2014.[239] The game later won the award for the Most Addicting Game at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards.[240] In addition, the Java Edition was nominated for \\"Favorite Video Game\\" at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards.[241][242]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit played a significant role in popularising Minecraft.[243] Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication showed that one-third of Minecraft players learned about the game via Internet videos.[244] In 2010, Minecraft-related videos began to gain influence on YouTube, often made by commentators. The videos usually contain screen-capture footage of the game and voice-overs.[245] Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players, walkthroughs of various tasks, and parodies of works in popular culture. By May 2012, over 4 million Minecraft-related YouTube videos had been uploaded.[246] Some popular commentators have received employment at Machinima, a gaming video company that owns a highly watched entertainment channel on YouTube.[245] The Yogscast is a British organisation that regularly produces Minecraft videos; their YouTube channel has attained billions of views, and their panel at MineCon 2011 had the highest attendance.[245][247] Other well known YouTube personnel include Jordan Maron, who has created many Minecraft parodies, including \\"Minecraft Style\\", a parody of the internationally successful single \\"Gangnam Style\\" by South Korean rapper PSY.[248] Herobrine is a major community icon of Minecraft, who first appeared as a single image on 4chan's /v/ board. According to rumours, Herobrine appears in players' worlds and builds strange constructions.[249] However, Mojang has confirmed that Herobrine has never existed in Minecraft, and there are no plans to add Herobrine.[250]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft has been referenced by other video games, such as RuneScape,[citation needed] Torchlight II, Borderlands 2, Choplifter HD, Super Meat Boy, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, The Binding of Isaac, The Stanley Parable, and FTL: Faster Than Light.[251][252] It was also referenced by electronic music artist deadmau5 in his performances.[253] A simulation of the game was featured in Lady Gaga's \\"G.U.Y.\\" music video.[254] The game is also referenced heavily in \\"Informative Murder Porn\\", the second episode of the seventeenth season of the animated television series South Park.[255] \\"Luca$\\", the seventeenth episode of the 25th season of the animated sitcom The Simpsons was inspired by Minecraft; Persson responded by tweeting \\"I'm not sure how I feel about it.\\"[256]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the release of Minecraft, some video games were released with various similarities with Minecraft, and some were called \\"clones\\" of the game. Examples include Ace of Spades, CastleMiner, CraftWorld, FortressCraft, Terraria, and Total Miner.[257] David Frampton, designer of The Blockheads, reported that one failure of his 2D game was the \\"low resolution pixel art\\" that too closely resembled the art in Minecraft which resulted in \\"some resistance\\" from fans.[258] A homebrew adaptation of the alpha version of Minecraft for the Nintendo DS, titled DScraft, has been released; it has been noted for its similarity to the original game considering the technical limitations of the system.[259]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and their Minecraft IP, various developers announced even further clone titles that were being developed specifically for Nintendo's consoles, as they were the only major platforms to not officially receive Minecraft at the time.[260] These clone titles include UCraft (Nexis Games),[261] Cube Life: Island Survival (Cypronia),[262] Discovery (noowanda),[263] Battleminer (Wobbly Tooth Games),[264] Cube Creator 3D (Big John Games),[265] and Stone Shire (Finger Gun Games).[266] Despite this the fears were unfounded with official Minecraft releases on Nintendo consoles eventually resuming.[267][155][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Mojang received offers from Hollywood producers who wanted to produce Minecraft-related TV shows; however, Mojang stated that they would only engage in such projects when \\"the right idea comes along\\".[246] By February 2014, Persson revealed that Mojang was in talks with Warner Bros. regarding a Minecraft film.[268][269] and by that October, it was \\"in its early days of development\\".[270][271] The film was scheduled for release on 24 May 2019, and was going to be directed by Shawn Levy and written by Jason Fuchs.[272][273] Levy later dropped out and was replaced by Rob McElhenney.[274][275] In August 2018, McElhenney left the film and Fuchs was replaced with Aaron and Adam Nee resulting in its release date getting delayed.[276]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, a documentary about the development of Mojang and Minecraft was released in December 2012. Titled Minecraft: The Story of Mojang, the film was produced by 2 Player Productions.[277] In 2014, an attempt to crowdfund a fan film through Kickstarter was shut down after Persson refused to let the filmmakers use the license.[278][279]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Lego set based on Minecraft called Lego Minecraft was released on 6 June 2012.[280] The set, called \\"Micro World\\", centres around the game's default player character and a creeper.[281] Mojang submitted the concept of Minecraft merchandise to Lego in December 2011 for the Lego Cuusoo program, from which it quickly received 10,000 votes by users, prompting Lego to review the concept.[282] Lego Cuusoo approved the concept in January 2012 and began developing sets based on Minecraft.[282] Two more sets based on the Nether and village areas of the game were released on 1 September 2013. A fourth Micro World set, the End, was released in June 2014. Six more sets became available November 2014.[283]\\r\\n\\r\\nMojang collaborates with Jinx, an online game merchandise store, to sell Minecraft merchandise, such as clothing, foam pickaxes, and toys of creatures in the game.[67] By May 2012, over 1 million dollars were made from Minecraft merchandise sales. T-shirts and socks were the most popular products.[246] In March 2013 Mojang signed a deal with the Egmont Group, a children's book publisher, to create Minecraft handbooks, annuals, poster books, and magazines.[284][285][286]\\r\\n\\r\\nMineCon is an official convention dedicated to Minecraft. The first one was held in November 2011 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. All 4,500 tickets for MineCon 2011 were sold out by 31 October.[287] The event included the official launch of Minecraft; keynote speeches, including one by Persson; building and costume contests; Minecraft-themed breakout classes; exhibits by leading gaming and Minecraft-related companies; commemorative merchandise; and autograph and picture times with Mojang employees and well-known contributors from the Minecraft community.[288] After MineCon, there was an Into The Nether after-party with deadmau5.[289] Free codes were given to every attendee of MineCon that unlocked alpha versions of Mojang's Scrolls, as well as an additional non-Mojang game, Cobalt, developed by Oxeye Game Studios.[290] Similar events occurred in MineCon 2012, which took place in Disneyland Paris from in November.[291] The tickets for the 2012 event sold out in less than two hours.[292] MineCon 2013 was held in Orlando in November as well.[293][294] MineCon 2015 was held in London in July.[295] MineCon 2016 was held in Anaheim in September.[296] MineCon 2017 was held as a livestream instead of being held at a show floor. Titled \\"MineCon Earth\\", it was streamed live on November.[nb 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possible applications of Minecraft have been discussed extensively, especially in the fields of computer-aided design and education. In a panel at MineCon 2011, a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks, stating that rendering using Minecraft was much more user-friendly for the community, making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks.[245] In 2012, a member of the Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab, Cody Sumter, said: \\"Notch hasn't just built a game. He's tricked 40 million people into learning to use a CAD program.\\" Various software has been developed to allow virtual designs to be printed using professional 3D printers or personal printers such as MakerBot and RepRap.[299]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2012, Mojang began the Block By Block project in cooperation with UN Habitat to create real-world environments in Minecraft.[300] The project allows young people who live in those environments to participate in designing the changes they would like to see. Using Minecraft, the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the Minecraft servers and modify their own neighbourhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \\"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\\", adding \\"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's Sustainable Urban Development Network to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\\" Mojang signed Minecraft building community, FyreUK, to help render the environments into Minecraft. The first pilot project began in Kibera, one of Nairobi's informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The Block By Block project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, Mina Kvarter (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualise how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualise urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture. The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions.[301]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2014, the Danish Geodata Agency generated all of Denmark in fullscale in Minecraft based on their own geodata.[302] This is possible because Denmark is one of the flattest countries with the highest point at 171 meters (ranking as the country with the 30th smallest elevation span), where the limit in default Minecraft is around 192 meters above in-game sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinecraft has also been used in educational settings.[303] In 2011, an educational organisation named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing Minecraft into schools. The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools. In September 2012, MinecraftEdu said that approximately 250,000 students around the world have access to Minecraft through the company.[304] A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects, including history, language arts and science. For an example, one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore.[304]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the introduction of redstone blocks to represent electrical circuits, users have been able to build functional virtual computers within Minecraft.[305] Such virtual creations include a working hard drive,[306] an 8-bit virtual computer,[307] and emulators for the Atari 2600 (by SethBling)[308] and Game Boy Advance.[309] In at least one instance, a mod has been created to use this feature to teach younger players how to program within a language set by the virtual computer within a Minecraft world.[310]\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft and non-profit Code.org had teamed up to offer Minecraft-based games, puzzles, and tutorials aimed to help teach children how to program; by March 2018, Microsoft and Code.org reported that more than 85 million children have used their tutorials.[311]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2014, the British Museum in London announced plans to recreate its building along with all exhibits in Minecraft in conjunction with members of the public.[312]","input":"When was the first version of minecraft created?"},{"output":"South Africa","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n?A. africanus  ?A. deyiremeda ?A. garhi ?A. sediba Also called Paranthropus ?P. aethiopicus ?P. robustus ?P. boiseiAlso called Praeanthropus?A. afarensis  ?A. anamensis ?A. bahrelghazali\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecus (/??str?l??p?Ĳ?k?s, -lo?-/ OS-tr?-lo-PITH-i-k?s;[1] from Latin  australis, meaning 'southern', and Greek  ?ĲҰ?

If so, they would be considered 'robust australopiths', while the others would be 'gracile australopiths'. However, if these more robust species do constitute their own genus, they would be under the genus name Paranthropus, a genus described by Robert Broom when the first discovery was made in 1938, which makes these species P. robustus, P. boisei and P. aethiopicus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecus species played a significant part in human evolution, the genus Homo being derived from Australopithecus at some time after three million years ago.\\r\\nIn addition, they were the first hominids to possess certain genes, known as the duplicated SRGAP2, which increased the length and ability of neurons in the brain.[6] One of the australopith species evolved into the genus Homo in Africa around two million years ago (e.g. Homo habilis), and eventually modern humans, H. sapiens sapiens.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nGracile australopiths shared several traits with modern apes and humans, and were widespread throughout Eastern and Northern Africa around 3.5 million years ago. The earliest evidence of fundamentally bipedal hominids can be observed at the site of Laetoli in Tanzania. This site contains hominid footprints that are remarkably similar to those of modern humans and have been dated to as old as 3.6 million years.[8] The footprints have generally been classified as australopith is the only form of prehuman known to have existed in that region at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecus anamensis, A. afarensis, and A. africanus are among the most famous of the extinct hominins. A. africanus was once considered to be ancestral to the genus Homo (in particular Homo erectus). However, fossils assigned to the genus Homo have been found that are older than A. africanus[citation needed]. Thus, the genus Homo either split off from the genus Australopithecus at an earlier date (the latest common ancestor being either A. afarensis or an even earlier form, possibly Kenyanthropus), or both developed from a yet possibly unknown common ancestor independently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, the human (Ardipithecus, Australopithecus and Homo) and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus) lineages diverged from a common ancestor about five to six million years ago, assuming a constant rate of evolution. It is theoretically more likely for evolution to happen more slowly, as opposed to more quickly, from the date suggested by a gene clock (the result of which is given as a youngest common ancestor, i.e., the latest possible date of divergence.) However, hominins discovered more recently are somewhat older than the presumed rate of evolution would suggest.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSahelanthropus tchadensis, commonly called \\"Toumai\\", is about seven million years old and Orrorin tugenensis lived at least six million years ago. Since little is known of them, they remain controversial among scientists since the molecular clock in humans has determined that humans and chimpanzees had a genetic split at least a million years later. One theory suggests that the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged somewhat at first, then some populations interbred around one million years after diverging.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brains of most species of Australopithecus were roughly 35% of the size of a modern human brain. Most species of Australopithecus were diminutive and gracile, usually standing 1.2 to 1.4?m (3?ft 11?in to 4?ft 7?in) tall. In several variations is a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism, males being larger than females.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to one scholar, A. Zihlman, Australopithecus body proportions closely resemble those of bonobos (Pan paniscus),[11] leading evolutionary biologists such as  Jeremy Griffith to suggest that bonobos may be phenotypically similar to Australopithecus.[12] Furthermore, thermoregulatory models suggest that Australopithecus species were fully hair covered, more like chimpanzees and bonobos, and unlike humans.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern humans do not appear to display the same degree of sexual dimorphism as Australopithecus did. In modern populations, males are on average a mere 15% larger than females, while in Australopithecus, males could be up to 50% larger than females. New research suggests, however, that australopithecines exhibited a lesser degree of sexual dimorphism than these figures suggest, but the issue is not settled.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpinions differ as to whether the species A. aethiopicus, A. boisei, and A. robustus should be included within the genus Australopithecus, and no current consensus exists as to whether they should be placed in a distinct genus, Paranthropus, which is suggested to have developed from the ancestral Australopithecus line.[citation needed] Until the last half-decade, the majority of the scientific community included all the species shown in the box at the top of this article in a single genus. The postulated genus Paranthropus was morphologically distinct from Australopithecus, and its specialized morphology implies that its behaviour may have been quite different from that of its ancestors, although it has been suggested that the distinctive features of A. aethiopicus, A. boisei, and A. robustus may have evolved independently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fossil record seems to indicate that Australopithecus is the common ancestor of the distinct group of hominids now called Paranthropus (the \\"robust australopiths\\"), and most likely the genus Homo, which includes modern humans. Although the intelligence of these early hominids was likely no more sophisticated than in modern apes, the bipedal stature is the key element that distinguishes the group from previous primates, which were quadrupeds. The morphology of Australopithecus upset what scientists previously believed  namely, that strongly increased brain size had preceded bipedalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf A. afarensis was the definite hominid that left the footprints at Laetoli, that strengthens the notion that A. afarensis had a small brain, but was a biped. Fossil evidence such as this makes it clear that bipedalism far predated large brains. However, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged (several concepts are still being studied). The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators. However, many anthropologists argue that these advantages were not large enough to cause the emergence of bipedalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent study of primate evolution and morphology noted that all apes, both modern and fossil, show skeletal adaptations to erect posture of the trunk, and that fossils such as Orrorin tugenensis indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggested that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Studies of modern orangutans in Sumatra have shown that these apes use four legs when walking on large, stable branches, and swing underneath slightly smaller branches, but are bipedal and keep their legs very straight when walking on multiple flexible branches under 4?cm diameter, while also using their arms for balance and additional support. This enables them to get nearer to the edge of the tree canopy to get fruit or cross to another tree.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestors of gorillas and chimpanzees are suggested to have become more specialised in climbing vertical tree trunks, using a bent hip and bent knee posture that matches the knuckle-walking posture they use for ground travel. This was due to climate changes around 11 to 12 million years ago that affected forests in East and Central Africa, so periods occurred when openings prevented travel through the tree canopy, and at these times, ancestral hominids could have adapted the erect walking behaviour for ground travel. Humans are closely related to these apes, and share features including wrist bones apparently strengthened for knuckle-walking.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the view that human ancestors were knuckle-walkers is now questioned since the anatomy and biomechanics of knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas are different, suggesting that this ability evolved independently after the last common ancestor with the human lineage.[16] Further comparative analysis with other primates suggests that these wrist-bone adaptations support a palm-based tree walking.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadical changes in morphology took place before gracile australopiths evolved; the pelvis structure and feet are very similar to modern humans.[17] The teeth have small canines, but australopiths generally evolved a larger postcanine dentition with thicker enamel.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost species of Australopithecus were not any more adept at tool use than modern nonhuman primates, yet modern African apes, chimpanzees, and most recently gorillas, have been known to use simple tools (i.e. cracking open nuts with stones and using long sticks to dig for termites in mounds), and chimpanzees have been observed using spears (not thrown) for hunting.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time, no known stone tools were associated with A. afarensis, and paleoanthropologists commonly thought that stone artifacts only dated back to about 2.5 million years ago.[19] However, a 2010 study  suggests the hominin species ate meat by carving animal carcasses with stone implements. This finding pushes back the earliest known use of stone tools among hominins to about 3.4 million years ago.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome have argued that A. garhi used stone tools due to a loose association of this species and butchered animal remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecines have thirty two teeth, like modern humans, but with an intermediate formation; between the great apes and humans. Their molars were parallel, like those of great apes, and they had a slight pre-canine diastema. But, their canines were smaller, like modern humans, and with the teeth less interlocked than in previous hominins. In fact, in some australopithecines the canines are shaped more like incisors.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe molars of Australopithicus fit together in much the same way human's do, with low crowns and four low, rounded cusps used for crushing. They have cutting edges on the crests.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobust australopithecines (like A. boisei and A. robustus) had larger cheek, or buccal, teeth than the smaller ÿ or gracile ÿ species (like A. afarensis and A. africanus). It is possible that they had more tough, fibrous plant material in their diets while the smaller species of Australopithecus had more meat. But it is also possibly due to their generally larger build requiring more food. Their larger molars do support a slightly different diet, including some hard food.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecines also had thick enamel, like those in genus Homo, while other great apes have markedly thinner enamel. One explanation for the thicker enamel is that these hominins were living more on the ground than in the trees and were foraging for tubers, nuts, and cereal grains. They would also have been eating a lot of gritty dirt with the food, which would wear at enamel, so thicker enamel would be advantageous. Or, it could simply indicate a change in diet. Robust australopithecines wore their molar surfaces down flat, unlike the more gracile species, who kept their crests, which certainly seems to suggest a different diet. The gracile Australopithecus had larger incisors, which indicates tearing and more meat in the diet, likely scavenged. The wear patterns on the tooth surfaces support a largely herbivorous diet.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we examine the buccal microwear patterns on the teeth of A. afarensis and A. anamensis, we see that A. afarensis did not consume a lot of grasses or seeds, but rather ate fruits and leaves, but A. anamensis did eat grasses and seeds in addition to fruits and leaves.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1979 preliminary microwear study of Australopithecus fossil teeth, anthropologist Alan Walker theorized that robust australopiths were largely frugivorous.[23] Australopithecus species mainly ate fruit, vegetables, small lizards, and tubers. Much research has focused on a comparison between the South African species A. africanus and Paranthropus robustus. Early analyses of dental microwear in these two species showed, compared to P. robustus, A. africanus had fewer microwear features and more scratches as opposed to pits on its molar wear facets.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese observations have been interpreted as evidence that P. robustus may have fed on hard and brittle foods, such as some nuts and seeds.[24] More recently, new analyses based on three-dimensional renderings of wear facets have confirmed earlier work, but have also suggested that P. robustus ate hard foods primarily as a fallback resource, while A. africanus ate more mechanically tough foods.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, trace-element studies of the strontium/calcium ratios in robust australopith fossils suggested the possibility of animal consumption, as they did in 1994 using stable carbon isotopic analysis.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, fossils of animal bones with butchery marks dating 2.6 million years old were found at the site of Gona, Ethiopia. Fossil evidence indicates meat consumption by at least three species of hominins occurring around 2.6-2.5 Mya: A. africanus, A. garhi, and P. aethiopicus.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, fossils of butchered animal bones dated 3.4 million years old were found in Ethiopia, close to regions where australopith fossils were found.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe type specimen for genus Australopithecus was discovered in 1924, in a lime quarry by workers at Taung, South Africa. The specimen was studied by the Australian anatomist Raymond Dart, who was then working at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The fossil skull was from a three-year-old bipedal primate that he named Australopithecus africanus. The first report was published in Nature in February 1925. Dart realised that the fossil contained a number of humanoid features, and so, he came to the conclusion that this was an early ancestor of humans.[29] Later, Scottish paleontologist Robert Broom and Dart set about to search for more early hominin specimens, and at several sites they found more A. africanus remains, as well as fossils of a species Broom named Paranthropus (which would now be recognised as P. robustus). Initially, anthropologists were largely hostile to the idea that these discoveries were anything but apes, though this changed during the late 1940s.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first australopithecine discovered in eastern Africa was a skull belonging to an A. boisei that was excavated in 1959 in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by Mary Leakey. Since then, the Leakey family have continued to excavate the gorge, uncovering further evidence for australopithecines, as well as for Homo habilis and Homo erectus.[30] The scientific community took 20 years to widely accept Australopithecus as a member of the family tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in 1997, an almost complete Australopithecus skeleton with skull was found in the Sterkfontein caves of Gauteng, South Africa. It is now called \\"Little Foot\\" and it is probably around three million years old. It was named Australopithecus prometheus[31][32] which has since been placed within A. africanus. Other fossil remains found in the same cave in 2008 were named Australopithecus sediba, which lived 1.9 million years ago. A. africanus probably evolved into A. sediba, which some scientists think may have evolved into H. erectus,[33] though this is heavily disputed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA taxonomy of the Australopithecus within the great apes is assessed as follows, with Paranthropus and Homo emerging among the Australopthecus. Australopithecus with conventional definitions is assessed to be highly paraphyletic, i.e. it is not a natural group.[34].  The exact phylogeny within Australopithecus is still highly controversial. Approximate radiation dates of daughter clades is shown in Millions of years ago (Mya). Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, and Ardipithecus, possibly sisters to Australopithecus, are not shown here.\\r\\n\\r\\nHylobatidae (gibbons)\\r\\n\\r\\nPonginae (orangutans)\\r\\n\\r\\nGorillini (gorillas)\\r\\n\\r\\nPanina (chimpanzees)\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecus anamensis (?)\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecus afarensis (?)\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecus garhi (?)\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralopithecus africanus (?)\\r\\n\\r\\nParanthropus (?2)\\r\\n\\r\\nHomo\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen originally defined, Homo and Australopithecus were disjunct taxa. However, Homo is now widely regarded as having emerged in Australopithecus, so with conventional definitions Australopithicus is paraphyletic.[35][36][34] Paraphyletic groupings are problematic, as one can not talk precisely about their phylogenic relationships, their characteristic traits and literal extinction.[37][34] Paraphyletic, Stem group, chronospecies  or 'grade' groupings have also been used to emphasize perceived (sometimes religious) human exceptionalism. This can be taken quite literally: humans have never been placed in a paraphyletic group.[38][39] Paleoanthropologists constantly violate the rules of taxonomy.[40] Paraphyletic groups are often a relic from previous erroneous assessments about phylogenic relationships, or from before the rise of cladistics. In modern systematic classification of life, cladistics is used to assemble the tree of life.[41][34][42] In cladistics, all descendents of the last common ancestor of a group are taken to be part of the group, i.e. Homo is part of Australopithecus.\\r\\n\\r\\nConventionally, however, Homo and Australopithecus both are at the genus level, giving rise to a new discussion of where the genus level should be. Previously, it was proposed to join Pan with Homo in a genus Homo or Pan, with the argument that the diversity and age corresponds roughly to other genera. This proposal was met with resistance, again due to apparent human exceptionalist feelings: This would have resulted in humans being called 'Pan sapiens' or Chimpanzees being called 'Homo troglodytes'.[39][43][44] In this case, likewise, despite resistance new genera are being proposed or could be proposed for the Australopithecus members; (almost) nobody is proposing to be renamed 'Australopithecus sapiens'.[45][46][47][48][49][50] ^  There are further discussions about whether Homo should be split up into different genera.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spot where the first Australopithecus boisei was discovered in Tanzania.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal skull of Mrs. Ples, a female A. africanus\\r\\n\\r\\nTaung Child by Cicero Moraes, Arc-Team, Antrocom NPO, Museum of the University of Padua.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast of the skeleton of Lucy, an A. afarensis\\r\\n\\r\\nSkull of the Taung child\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Drosophila is not Drosophila any more, why it will be worse and what can be done about it?","input":"Where have most fossils of australopithecus been found?"},{"output":"no minimum consumption age for alcohol","context":"Alcohol has been consumed in New Zealand since the arrival of European settlers. The most popular alcoholic beverages are beer and wine. New Zealand has no minimum consumption age for alcohol, however the minimum purchase age is 18.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no oral tradition or archaeological evidence of Mori brewing beer before the arrival of Europeans. Major ingredients of beer were not introduced to New Zealand until Europeans arrived in the late-18th century. Captain James Cook brewed a beer flavoured with local spruce tree needles while visiting New Zealand in 1773 in order to combat scurvy aboard ship.[2] He brewed the beer while anchored in Ship Cove in the outer reaches of Queen Charlotte Sound in January 1770. Here he experimented with the use of young rimu branches as a treatment against scurvy. It was brewed on Saturday 27 March 1773 on Resolution Island, in Dusky Sound, Fiordland. The beer was brewed using wort with the addition of molasses and rimu bark and leaves. James Cook wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"We also began to brew beer from the branches or leaves of a tree, which much resembles the American black-spruce. From the knowledge I had of this tree, and the similarity it bore to the spruce, I judged that, with the addition of inspissated juice of wort and molasses, it would make a very wholesome beer, and supply the want of vegetables, which this place did not afford; and the event proved that I was not mistaken.\\"[3]\\r\\nWine making and vine growing go back to colonial times in New Zealand. British Resident and keen oenologist James Busby was, as early as 1836, attempting to produce wine at his land in Waitangi.[4]  In 1851 New Zealand's oldest existing vineyard was established by French Roman Catholic missionaries at Mission Estate in Hawke's Bay.[5]  Due to economic (the importance of animal agriculture and the protein export industry), legislative (prohibition and the temperance) and cultural factors (the overwhelming predominance of beer and spirit drinking British immigrants), wine was for many years a marginal activity in terms of economic importance. Dalmatian immigrants arriving in New Zealand at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century brought with them viticultural knowledge and planted vineyards in West and North Auckland. Typically, their vineyards produced sherry and port for the palates of New Zealanders of the time, and table wine for their own community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three factors that held back the development of the industry simultaneously underwent subtle but historic changes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973, Britain entered the European Economic Community, which required the ending of historic trade terms for New Zealand meat and dairy products. This led ultimately to a dramatic restructuring of the agricultural economy. Before this restructuring was fully implemented, diversification away from traditional protein products to products with potentially higher economic returns was explored. Vines, which produce best in low moisture and low soil fertility environments, were seen as suitable for areas that had previously been marginal pasture. The end of the 1960s saw the end of the New Zealand institution of the \\"six o'clock swill\\", where pubs were open for only an hour after the end of the working day and closed all Sunday. The same legislative reform saw the introduction of BYO (bring your own) licences for restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the late 1960s and early 1970s noted the rise of the \\"overseas experience,\\" where young New Zealanders travelled and lived and worked overseas, predominantly in Europe. As a cultural phenomenon, the overseas experience predates the rise of New Zealand's premium wine industry, but by the 1960s a distinctly New Zealand identity had developed and the passenger jet made the overseas experience possible for large numbers of New Zealanders who experienced first-hand the premium wine cultures of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1836 and 1919, the New Zealand temperance movement became a powerful and popular lobby group, as similar movements did in the UK and the USA. In 1919 at a national referendum poll, prohibition gained 49% of the vote and was only defeated when the votes of returned servicemen were counted.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWell known temperance activists in New Zealand include William Fox, Frank Isitt, Leonard Isitt, Elizabeth McCombs, James McCombs, Kate Sheppard, Robert Stout and Tommy Taylor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquor laws of New Zealand begin with the Colonisation of New Zealand and the implementation of English Common Law to New Zealand between 1840 and 1842, when New Zealand was jurisdictionally part of the Colony of New South Wales.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaws for Mori\\r\\nThe first laws prohibiting Mori people from consuming alcohol in New Zealand were established between 1847 and 1878. Laws were passed due to the common belief the Mori were susceptible to alcohol abuse.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor over a century, from the 1847 laws to 1948, Mori were restricted to buying alcohol from off-licensed vendors. In 1948 Parliament repealed most discriminatory measures, in part due to pressure from Mori servicemen returning from war.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King Country had an alcohol ban from when the predominantly Mori area was opened to pakeha in 1883 to 1953. \\r\\n\\r\\nLaws for Women\\r\\nPrior to 1961, Women were generally restricted to private bars in hotels as legislation allowed licencees to refuse them service in the (cheaper) public bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1842 the first licensing system was introduced to New Zealand. This licensing system was mainly based on the then-provincial councils, however this changed in 1873 when legislature was passed to establish a national licensing system.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 1990s off-licence alcohol sales where restricted to hotels, bottle shops, and private clubs were also allowed to sell alcohol for take home consumption. In 1990 supermarkets were granted permission to sell wine but not beer, but under amendments made in 1999,[8] supermarkets and some smaller grocers now had permission to extend their liquor licences to sell beer as well as wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1999 legislation also legalized the sale of alcohol on Sundays for the first time in nearly 120 years.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nLicensing Act, 1881\\r\\nThe Licensing Act of 1881 was enacted due to the dissolution of the Provincial Councils of New Zealand to centralize the inconsistent statutes of the former Provinces.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Licensing Act of 1881 banned some entertainments, including dancing girls. Section 127 stated: Whereas a practice exists in certain parts of the colony of hiring women and young girls to dance in rooms and places where liquors are sold: any contract by which any females shall be hired to dance in any such room or place shall be null and void. Proprietors risked having their establishment identified as a disorderly house (a brothel), receiving a fine or losing their liquor license if they hired dancing girls.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Act banned alcohol sales on Sundays, Christmas Day, and Good Friday.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first registered consumption age limits were imposed for the first time meaning nobody under the age of 18 could drink in a public bar and nobody under the age of 13 could buy alcohol to take home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Licensing Act of 1881 created a minimum age of 16 to purchase alcohol in a bar, however did not impose a minimum age to purchase alcohol to be taken away.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legal drinking age was again amended in 1910 when the legal age to drink in hotels was increased to 21 - however minors could still buy alcohol to take home until 1914 when the age for both on- and off-licence purchase was set at 21.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969 the purchase age was lowered from 21 to 20. (although 18-year-olds were allowed to drink in bars from 1990 on certain conditions.) But in 1999 the legal purchasing age was lowered from 20 to 18 and despite several calls and legislation to raise the drinking age again, Lawmakers have overwhelmingly favoured the status quo and the age remains 18. It has never been illegal for a minor to drink alcohol in their own home on supervision of their parents or guardians however in 2013, minors consuming alcohol in a private setting other than their homes had to acquire parental permission before doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most significant piece of alcohol legislation introduced in New Zealand was the \\"six o'clock swill\\" in 1917. Intended to only be a temporary wartime measure through the remainder of World War One, this new law required all hotel bars to close at 6 pm nightly (and all day Sunday).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swill was made permanent in 1919 owing to pressure from the then powerful temperance movement. The new law was supposed to curb drunkenness and crime and to send men home early to encourage family life, however six o'clock closing had the opposite effect. \\r\\nMen would finish work at 5 pm and had only one hour to drink as much alcohol (usually beer and from half gallon (2.2 litre) jugs) as possible before closing. This phenomenon created a culture of binge drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six o'clock swill also encouraged men to drive home from the hotels extremely drunk and car crashes were the most common between 6 pm and 8 pm especially on Friday and Saturday evenings. This was not helped by the fact New Zealand had no realistic Blood Alcohol limits for driving until 1969.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swill ended on 9 October 1967 when pubs could stay open until 10 pm after a referendum on 26 September overwhelmingly saw voters favour change. A previous referendum in 1949 rejected later closing (due to economic rather than moral reasons).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder New Zealand law, pubs looking to operate after the 3-4am liquor sales ban will have to apply for special licensing from their local board.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLicensing trusts, under New Zealand law, are community-owned companies with a monopoly on the development of premises licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages and associated accommodation in an area.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty licencing trusts were established between 1944 and 1975. They were strongly supported by ministers Peter Fraser and Rex Mason. [11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeer is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale.[12] New Zealand is ranked 21st in beer consumption per capita, at around 75.5 litres per person per annum. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of lager, either pale or amber in colour, and between 4%ÿ5% alcohol by volume.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first commercial brewery in New Zealand was established in 1835 by Joel Samuel Polack in Kororareka (now Russell) in the Bay of Islands. During the 19th century, New Zealand inherited the brewing traditions and styles of the United Kingdom and Ireland, being where the majority of European immigrants originated from during that time ÿ thus the dominant beer styles would have been ales, porters & stouts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe culture of the six o'clock swill was to have an influence on the styles of beer brewed and drunk in New Zealand. In the 1930s, the New Zealander Morton W. Coutts invented the continuous fermentation process. Gradually, beer production in New Zealand shifted from ales to lagers, using continuous fermentation. The style of beer made by this method has become known as New Zealand Draught and became the most popular beer during the 6 o'clock swill period.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the same period, there was a gradual consolidation of breweries, such that by the 1970s virtually all brewing concerns in New Zealand were owned by either Lion Breweries or Dominion Breweries. From the 1980s small boutique or microbreweries started to emerge, and consequently the range of beer styles being brewed increased. The earliest was Mac's Brewery, started in 1981 in Nelson. Some pubs operated their own small breweries, often housed within the pub itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, pale and amber lager, the largest alcoholic drinks sector in terms of volume sales, have been on a downward trend as a result of a declining demand for standard and economy products.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, ale production in New Zealand is primarily undertaken by small independent breweries & brewpubs, the Shakespeare Brewery in Auckland city being the first opened in 1986 for the 'craft' or 'premium' sector of the beer market. In 2010, this 'craft/premium' sector grew by 11%, to around 8% of the total beer market.[12] This has been in a declining beer market, where availability of beer has dropped 7% by volume in the two previous years.\\r\\n\\r\\nCraft beer and microbreweries were blamed for a 15 million litre drop in alcohol sales overall in 2012, with Kiwis opting for higher-priced premium beers over cheaper brands.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe craft beer market in New Zealand is varied and progressive, with a full range of ale & lager styles of beer being brewed. New Zealand is fortunate in that it lies in the ideal latitude for barley and hops cultivation. A breeding programme had developed new hop varieties unique to New Zealand,[15] many of these new hops have become mainstays in New Zealand craft beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the small market and relatively high number of breweries, many breweries have spare capacity. A recent trend has seen the rise of contract brewing, where a brewing company contracts to use space in existing breweries to bring the beer to the market. Examples of contract brewers include Funk Estate, Epic Brewing Company and Yeastie Boys.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 2011 and 2012, New Zealand faced a shortage of hops, which affected several brewers countrywide, and was mainly due to a hop shortage in North America and an increase in demand for New Zealand hops overseas.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Montana in Marlborough started producing wines which were labelled by year of production (vintage) and grape variety (in the style of wine producers in Australia). The first production of a Sauvignon blanc of great note appears to have occurred in 1977. Also produced in that year were superior quality wines of Muller Thurgau, Riesling and Pinotage.\\r\\nThe excitement created from these successes and from the early results of Cabernet Sauvignon from Auckland and Hawkes Bay launched the industry with ever-increasing investment, leading to more hectares planted, rising land prices and greater local interest and pride. Such was the boom that over-planting occurred, particularly in the \\"wrong\\" varietals that fell out of fashion in the early 1980s. In 1984 the then Labour Government paid growers to pull up vines to address a glut that was damaging the industry. Ironically many growers used the Government grant not to restrict planting, but to swap from less economic varieties (such as Mller Thurgau and other hybrids) to more fashionable varieties (Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc), using the old root stock. The glut was only temporary in any case, as boom times returned swiftly.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Zealand is home to a successful variety of sauvignon blanc. Oz Clarke, a well-known British wine critic wrote in the 1990s that New Zealand Sauvignon blanc was \\"arguably the best in the world\\" (Rachman).[citation needed] Historically, Sauvignon blanc has been used in many French regions in both AOC and Vin de Pays wine. The most famous had been Frances Sancerre. It is also the grape used to make Pouilly Fum.\\r\\nFollowing Robert Mondavi's lead in renaming Californian Sauvignon blanc Fum Blanc (partially in reference to Pouilly Fum and partially to denote the smokiness of the wine produced due to flinty soil properties and partial oak barrel ageing) there was a trend for oaked Sauvignon blanc in New Zealand during the late 1980s.  Later the fashion for strong oaky overtones and also the name waned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, wineries in New Zealand, especially in the Marlborough region, began producing outstanding, some critics said unforgettable, Sauvignon blanc. \\"New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is like a child who inherits the best of both parentsexotic aromas found in certain Sauvignon blancs from the New World and the pungency and limy acidity of an Old World Sauvignon blanc like Sancerre from the Loire Valley\\" (Oldman, p.?152). One critic said that drinking one's first New Zealand Sauvignon blanc was like having sex for the first time (Taber, p.?244). \\"No other region in the world can match Marlborough, the northeastern corner of New Zealand's South Island, which seems to be the best place in the world to grow Sauvignon blanc grapes\\" (Taber, p.?244).","input":"What is the drinking age in new zealand?"},{"output":"United States Congress","context":"The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or FWS) is an agency of the federal government within the U.S. Department of the Interior dedicated to the management of fish, wildlife, and natural habitats.

In 1903, the Fish Commission was reorganized as the United States Bureau of Fisheries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1885ÿ1886, the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy (in 1885 it was the Section of Economic Ornithology)[8] was established within the United States Department of Agriculture. In 1896 it became the Division of Biological Survey. Its early work focused on the effect of birds in controlling agricultural pests and mapping the geographical distribution of plants and animals in the United States. Clinton Hart Merriam headed the Bureau for 25 years and became a national figure for improving the scientific understanding of birds and mammals in the United States. Jay Norwood Darling was appointed Chief of the new Bureau of Biological Survey in 1934; the same year Congress passed the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), one of the oldest federal environmental review statutes.[9]  Under Darling's guidance, the Bureau began an ongoing legacy of protecting vital natural habitat throughout the country.  The USFWS was finally created in 1940, when the Bureaus of Fisheries and Biological Survey were combined after being moved to the Department of the Interior.

Such a judgment may be issued on the merits of an entire case, or on discrete issues in that case.\\r\\nIn common-law systems, questions about what the law actually is in a particular case are decided by judges; in rare cases jury nullification of the law may act to contravene or complement the instructions or orders of the judge, or other officers of the court. A factfinder has to decide what the facts are and apply the law. In traditional common law the factfinder was a jury, but in many jurisdictions the judge now acts as the factfinder as well. It is the factfinder who decides \\"what really happened\\", and it is the judge who applies the law to the facts as determined by the factfinder, whether directly or by giving instructions to the jury.\\r\\nIn the absence of an award of summary judgment (or some type of pretrial dismissal), a lawsuit ordinarily proceeds to trial, which is an opportunity for litigants to present evidence in an attempt to persuade the factfinder that they are saying \\"what really happened\\", and that, under the applicable law, they should prevail.\\r\\nThe necessary steps before a case can get to trial include disclosing documents to the opponent by discovery, showing the other side the evidence, often in the form of witness statements. This process is lengthy, and can be difficult and costly.\\r\\nA party moving (applying) for summary judgment is attempting to avoid the time and expense of a trial when, in the moving party's view, the outcome is obvious. Typically this is stated as, when all the evidence likely to be put forward is such that no reasonable factfinder could disagree with the moving party, summary judgment is appropriate. Sometimes this will occur when there is no real dispute as to what happened, but it also frequently occurs when there is a nominal dispute but the non-moving party cannot produce enough evidence to support its position. A party may also move for summary judgment in order to eliminate the risk of losing at trial, and possibly avoid having to go through discovery (i.e., by moving at the outset of discovery), by demonstrating to the judge, via sworn statements and documentary evidence, that there are no material factual issues remaining to be tried. If there is nothing for the factfinder to decide, then the moving party asks rhetorically, why have a trial? The moving party will also attempt to persuade the court that the undisputed material facts require judgment to be entered in its favor. In many jurisdictions, a party moving for summary judgment takes the risk that, although the judge may agree there are no material issues of fact remaining for trial, the judge may also find that it is the non-moving party that is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\r\\nIn the United States federal courts, summary judgment is governed by Federal Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, derived primarily from the three seminal cases concerning summary judgment out of the 1980s. See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322ÿ27 (1986) (clarifying the shifting allocations of burdens of production, persuasion, and proof at summary judgment); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 257 (1986) (applying heightened evidentiary standard of proof in libel action to judicial assessment of propriety of summary judgment); Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v.

At the federal level, a summary-judgment motion in United States District Court is governed by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Other pretrial motions, such as a \\"motion for judgment on the pleadings\\" or a \\"motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,\\" can be converted by the judge to summary-judgment motions if matters outside the pleadings are presented to?ÿ and not excluded by?ÿ the trial-court judge.\\r\\nA party seeking summary judgment (or making any other motion) is called the movant (usually, this is defendant); the opposing party is the nonmovant (usually, plaintiff). Per Rule 56(a), issuance of summary judgment can be based only upon the court's finding that, both:\\r\\nHere:\\r\\nOf cardinal importance here is that, by design: the judge had no discretion at summary judgment time: all fact-finding is done by the jury at trial, not by the judge at summary judgment (the judge only looks for the existence of disputed \\"facts\\" to be \\"found\\").\\r\\nSummary judgment in the United States applies only in civil cases. It does not apply to criminal cases to obtain a pretrial judgment of conviction or acquittal, in part because a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a jury trial.[1] Some federal and state-court judges publish general guidelines and sample summary-judgment forms.[2][3][4][5]\\r\\nAccording to Federal Judicial Center research, summary-judgment motions are filed in 17% of federal cases.[6] Since almost two-thirds of federal civil cases are dismissed or settled, over half of the cases that reach the final judgment stage were disposed of via summary judgment.[7] 71% of summary-judgment motions were filed by defendants, 26% by plaintiffs.[6] Out of these, 36% of the motions were denied, and 64% were granted in whole or in part.[6]\\r\\nFrom a tactical perspective, there are two basic types of summary-judgment motions. One requires a full evidentiary presentation, and the other requires only a more limited, targeted one.\\r\\nFirst, a plaintiff may seek summary judgment on any cause of action, and similarly, a defendant may seek summary judgment in its favor on any affirmative defense. But in either case, the moving party must produce evidence in support of each and every essential element of the claim or defense (as it would have to do at trial). To be successful, this type of summary-judgment motion must be drafted as a written preview of a party's entire case-in-chief (that it would put before the finder of fact at trial) because all parts of an entire claim or defense are at issue.\\r\\nSecond, a different and very common tactic is where a defendant seeks summary judgment on a plaintiff's cause of action. The key difference is that in this latter situation, the defendant need only attack one essential element of the plaintiff's claim. A finding that the plaintiff cannot prove one essential element of its claim necessarily renders all other elements immaterial and results in summary judgment for the defendant. So these motions tend to be precisely targeted to the weakest points of the plaintiff's case. It is also possible for a plaintiff to seek summary judgment on a defendant's affirmative defense, but those types of motions are very rare.\\r\\nRegardless of the type of summary judgment motion, there is a standardized rule(-like) framework for evaluating the first clause of Rule 56(a) (no disputed genuine issue of material fact\\"), formulated as the following six core summary judgment tenets of review (SJTOR) (where the emphasized musts indicate the lack of judicial discretion permitted):\\r\\nA party seeking summary judgment may refer to any evidence that would be admissible at trial, such as depositions (or deposition excerpts), party admissions, affidavits in support from witnesses, documents received during discovery (such as contracts, emails, letters, and certified government documents). The evidences should be accompanied by a declaration from the moving party that all copies of the documents are true and correct, including deposition excerpts. Each party may present to the court its view of applicable law by submitting a legal memorandum supporting, or opposing, the motion. The opposing party may also file its own summary-judgment motion (called a \\"cross-motion\\"), if deadline still allows. The court may allow for oral argument of the lawyers, generally where the judge wishes to question the lawyers on issues in the case.\\r\\nDeadline for filing of the dispositive motions in U.S. federal court system is set by judge in the initial discovery plan order. If a party wants to file a motion or a cross-motion for summary judgment after the deadline, it needs to ask for leave of court. Normally, federal judges require valid reasons to alter case-management deadlines and only do so with reluctance.\\r\\nThere are also freely accessible web search engines to assist parties in finding court decisions that can be cited as an example or analogy to resolve similar questions of law.[8] Google Scholar is the biggest database of full-text state and federal court decisions that can be accessed without charge.[8][9] These web search engines often allow one to select specific state courts to search.[8] Summary judgment is awarded if the undisputed facts and the law make it clear that it would be impossible for one party to prevail if the matter were to proceed to trial. The court must consider all designated evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary-judgment motion.\\r\\nIf a trial could result in the jury (or judge in a bench trial) deciding in favor of the party opposing the motion, then summary judgment is inappropriate. A decision granting summary judgment can be appealed without delay. A decision denying summary judgment ordinarily cannot be immediately appealed; instead, the case continues on its normal course. In United States federal courts, a denial of summary judgment cannot be appealed until final resolution of the whole case, because of the requirements of 28 U.S.C.??1291 and 28 U.S.C.??1292 (the final judgment rule).\\r\\nTo defeat a summary-judgment motion, the non-moving party only has to show substantial evidence that a dispute of material facts exists, regardless of the strength of that evidence. For example, even if the moving side can produce the testimony of \\"a dozen bishops\\", and the non-moving side only has the testimony of a known liar, then summary judgment is not appropriate. Deciding on the relative credibility of witnesses is a question for the factfinder at trial.\\r\\nWhere appropriate, a court may award judgment summarily upon fewer than all claims. This is known as \\"partial summary judgment\\".\\r\\nIt is not uncommon for summary judgments of lower U.S. courts in complex cases to be overturned on appeal. A grant of summary judgment is reviewed \\"de novo\\" (meaning, without deference to the views of the trial judge) both as to the determination that there is no remaining genuine issue of material fact and that the prevailing party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\r\\nSummary-judgment practice in most states is similar to federal practice, though with minor differences. For example, the U.S. state of California requires the moving party to actually present evidence rather than merely refer to evidence. See Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 25 Cal. 4th 826 (2001). This is done by attaching relevant documents and by summarizing all relevant factual points within those documents in a separate statement of facts. In turn, the record to be reviewed by the judge can be very large; for example, the Aguilar case involved a record of about 18,400 pages. Also, California uses the term \\"summary adjudication\\" instead of \\"partial summary judgment\\". The California view is that the latter term is an oxymoron since a judgment is supposed to be final (in the sense of completely disposing of the case). There is currently a conflict between the different districts of the California Courts of Appeal as to the availability of summary adjudication; most superior courts tend to side with the narrowest interpretation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, under which a party may make such a motion only with respect to an entire cause of action, an affirmative defense, or a punitive-damages claim. There is also language in section 437c about \\"issues of duty,\\" but some Courts of Appeal panels have given that phrase an extremely narrow interpretation due to evidence that the California State Legislature has been trying to stop the state courts from engaging in the piecemeal adjudication of individual issues.\\r\\nIn New York there is the procedure of summary judgment in lieu of complaint CPLR  3213. This allows a plaintiff in an action based on an instrument to pay money only or ajudgement to file a motion for summary judgment and supporting papers with the summons instead of a complaint. The motion must be noted to be heard on the date the defendant is required to appear under CPLR 320(a). If the plaintiff sets down the hearing date later than the minimum, he may require the defendant to serve a copy of the answering paper on him within the extended period. If the motion is denied the moving and answering papers shall be deemed the complaint and answer, respectively, unless the court orders other wise.\\r\\nMany U.S. district courts have developed their own requirements included in local rules for filing summary-judgment motions.[10] Local rules can set limits on the number of pages, explain if a separate factual statement is required, whether it is acceptable to combine motion petition with a response, and if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called a \\"judge's copy\\"), etc.[11][12] Local Rules can define page-layout elements like: margins, text font/size, distance between lines, mandatory footer text, page numbering, and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together ÿ i.e., acceptable fasteners, number and location of fastening holes, etc.[11][12][13] If the filed motion does not comply with the local rules, then the judge can choose to strike the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the local rules.\\r\\nSummary-judgment motions, like many other court filings, are a matter of public record. So under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 5.2, sensitive text like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts and children's names, should be redacted from the summary-judgment motion and accompanying exhibits.[14] The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted ÿ most often by stamping the word \\"redacted\\" on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court's permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. A minor's name of the petitions should be replaced with initials.[14]\\r\\nA person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction.[14] Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with court should be provided to the other parties in the case.\\r\\nIn England and Wales, Part 24[15] of the Civil Procedure Rules governs the award of summary judgment. Summary judgment is available in all claims against both the defendant and claimant with the following exceptions.\\r\\nSummary judgment procedures were broadened in Canadian courts in the 1980s. With the exception of Quebec (which has its own procedural device for disposing of abusive claims summarily), all provinces feature a summary judgment mechanism in their respective rules of civil procedure.[16] Ontario, after a study on the issues of access to justice,[17] reformed its rules in 2010 to extend the powers of motion judges and masters for ordering summary judgment, following the introduction of similar measures in Alberta and British Columbia.[18] In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada encouraged greater use of the procedure by the courts in its ruling in Hryniak v. Mauldin.","input":"What is a partial motion for summary judgment?"},{"output":"September 9, 2015","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBluetooth 4.2\\r\\n\\r\\niPad Pro\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPad Mini 4 (stylized and marketed as iPad mini 4)[4] is the fourth-generation iPad Mini tablet computer designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It was announced along with the iPad Pro on September 9, 2015, and released the same day. The iPad Mini 4, which replaced the iPad Mini 3, is the only iPad Mini currently sold by Apple solely as a 128GB model as of March 21, 2017, when the iPad Mini 2 was discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPad Mini 4 was announced during the \\"Hey Siri\\" Apple Special Event on September 9, 2015, alongside other new or refreshed products, including the iPad Pro, the iPhone 6s and the Apple TV. However, there was minimal focus directly on the new device, with only a brief mention at the end of the iPad Pro portion of the keynote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPad Mini 4 ships with the iOS 9 operating system pre-installed, and was the first device to do so. With an additional 1 GB of RAM compared to the previous generations' Mini, the iPad Mini 4 is capable of utilizing the Slide Over, Split View and Picture in Picture multitasking functions in iOS 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe device is compatible with iOS 9.1, which was released on October 21, 2015, which adds the News app for the UK and Australia as well as additional emoji and other bug fixes.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iPad Mini 4 was the first major redesign of the iPad Mini line, with a slightly taller and wider body (though with no increase in screen size) compared to the iPad Mini 2 and Mini 3. There is also a much thinner design, with the device mirroring the depth of the iPad Air 2 at 6.1 millimeters.[1] This device is also lighter than the previous generation by 33.2 grams.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the redesign, this device is incompatible with cases that would otherwise work with the iPad Mini 2 or iPad Mini 3. To compensate for this, Apple released a Smart Cover and Silicone Case for the Mini 4, which can be used separately or together as a fully protective case. Unlike the iPad Air 2, there is no leather Smart Case made by Apple for the device. The mute switch was removed, as was done for the iPad Air 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the iPad Mini 3, the iPad Mini 4 is available in three colors: Space Gray, Silver and Gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 were both released in October 2014, the Mini 3 carried over the Mini 2's internals including the A7 processor in place of the hardware found in the iPad Air 2. The iPad Mini 4 features upgraded hardware closer in specs to the iPad Air 2. However, the Mini 4 sports a dual-core A8 processor in place of the tri-core A8X.[1] Apple claims that this processor is \\"1.3x faster\\" at CPU tasks and \\"1.6x faster\\" at graphics tasks over the A7 processor found in previous Mini models. Along with the iPad Air 2, there are 2 GB of RAM, allowing the device to support the advanced multitasking features made available with the iOS 9 operating system.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the iPad Mini 3 that came before it, the iPad Mini 4 is capable of making mobile payments via Apple Pay in combination with the Touch ID sensor, although this can only be done in apps as the device lacks the NFC antenna required for payments at a merchant terminal. With iOS 10, Apple Pay is supported within the Safari app.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe device shares the same camera module as the iPad Air 2 with an 8 megapixel camera with a ?/2.4 aperture. The screen is the same Retina Display that has featured since the iPad Mini 2, although it is fully laminated (also like the iPad Air 2) and contains an anti-reflective coating, resulting in drastically improved picture quality compared to its predecessors. The iPad Mini 4 display features much improved color accuracy due to the increase to 101% sRGB Color Gamut compared to poor ~62% on the previous models.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has a slightly smaller battery compared to the previous generations though Apple claims the runtime to be the same 10 hours as its predecessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also an updated wireless module adding support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. As with its predecessor, the iPad Mini 4 was available with storage options of 16, 32, 64 or 128GB, although by March 2017 all but the 128GB model was discontinued.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nReviews have generally been positive, with The Verge giving the iPad Mini 4 a 9/10, praising the display, fast performance, great camera, and multitasking but disappointed with the speakers and chamfered edges.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCNET also praised the new \\"more vivid\\" display and the slimmer design as well as the new features in iOS 9 that the device can utilize. However, they also criticized it for being more expensive than other 8-inch tablets and the multitasking features not working as well on the smaller screen. There was also criticism of the iPad Mini 4's A8 processor which was a year old, regarded as a \\"step down\\" from the iPad Air 2's A8X and iPhone 6S's A9 processors. This contrasts with the iPad Mini 2 which featured the A7 processor used in the iPad Air and iPhone 5S when they were released in Fall 2013.[9]","input":"When was the apple ipad mini 4 released?"},{"output":"1987 Pontiac Trans Am","context":"Angela Martin (wife, m. 2008, 2014ÿ)\\r\\nEsther Bruegger (girlfriend, season 9 ep 18ÿ22)\\r\\nDwight Kurt Schrute III /??ru?t/ is a fictional character on The Office (U.S. TV series), portrayed by Rainn Wilson, and based on Gareth Keenan from the original UK series. His character is one of the highest-ranking salesmen as well as assistant (to the) regional manager[1] at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, although the series expands on his character as bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation, and as the owner of the business park enclosing Dunder Mifflin. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He is also known for his love relationship with Angela. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. In the final season, Dwight is finally offered the position of permanent Regional Manager.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDwight Schrute is portrayed by American actor Rainn Wilson. In a Rolling Stone interview, Seth Rogen said he auditioned for the role. The character is based on Gareth Keenan of the original British version of the show, who was played by actor Mackenzie Crook.\\r\\nAll original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. Unlike Steve Carell, Wilson watched every episode of the original British series, and was a fan before he auditioned for the U.S. version.[2] Wilson had originally auditioned for Michael Scott, a performance he described as a \\"terrible Gervais impersonation\\";[2] however, the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more, and hired him for the role. Wilson based Dwight's hairstyle on the style he himself had when at the age of sixteen.[2] In an interview, he said that he went to a barber to get \\"the worst haircut possible\\".[3]\\r\\nWhen the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, despite lacking general knowledge, at the Scranton branch of the paper distribution company, Dunder Mifflin. Dwight formally held the title of \\"Assistant to the Regional Manager\\",[4] but constantly refers to himself as \\"Assistant Regional Manager\\", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott. (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in \\"The Fight\\", tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the \\"title change only\\", then never acknowledges it again.) Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him.[2] Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and na?ve.[2] For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert.[5]\\r\\nDwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations.[2] At the office, his most recurring formal wear is a mustard-colored, short-sleeved collared shirt, with a dark necktie and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses one-upmanship to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.\\r\\nDwight is a former volunteer sheriff deputy,[6] but has to step down after breaking his pledge by helping his boss pass his drug test in the episode 'Drug Testing'. He is also a notary public; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's beet farm, alongside his cousin, Mose (played by producer/writer Michael Schur). Dwight has affinities for paintball, Battlestar Galactica, ping pong, survivalism, Goju Ryu karate[7] and weapons. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of cars behind the driver, because it is the safest location in a car.\\r\\nIn \\"Whistleblower\\", encouraged to invest in real estate by former CEO and owner of Dunder Mifflin, Jo Bennett, Dwight decides to purchase the industrial park building. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting the building lobby into a coffee shop in \\"Nepotism\\", converting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art gym in \\"Mrs. California\\", and organizing a barn maze before Halloween, where kids can pay admission to play, in \\"WUPHF.com\\".\\r\\nIn an episode commentary on the season one DVD, Wilson refers to Dwight as a \\"fascist nerd\\". In a feature on the season three DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as \\"someone who does not hate the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it\\".[8]\\r\\nAll throughout the series Dwight drives a maroon 1987 Pontiac Trans Am, until the finale where he owns an orange 2012 Dodge Challenger.\\r\\nIn \\"Lecture Circuit\\", Dwight claims to remember his own birth, including his father, Dwight Schrute II, delivering him from the womb, and his mother biting off the umbilical cord.[9] In \\"Grief Counseling\\", Dwight states that he was a twin, but he \\"resorbed\\" his twin while still in his mother's womb (this occurrence is called twin embolisation syndrome), causing him to believe that he now has \\"the strength of a grown man and a little baby\\". He also claims to have been born weighing 13?lb 5?oz (6.0?kg), rendering his mother incapable of walking for three months and two days,[10] and in \\"Baby Shower\\", he claims to have performed his own circumcision. In \\"Viewing Party\\", he informs Jim and Pam Halpert that, in the Schrute family, the youngest child raises the other children.\\r\\nLittle is known about Dwight's parents, except that his father used to take him hunting, cheated in games, made him and his siblings biscuits for breakfast every morning, and that he battled obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.\\r\\nDwight's maternal grandfather, whose surname is Manheim (according to Dwight's web log on NBC.com)[11] fought in the Second World War. He killed twenty men before being imprisoned in an Allied prison camp (revealed in \\"The Fight\\"), implying that he was a soldier in the German army. In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", Dwight tells the documentary film crew that his grandfather is (at the time of the episode) 103 years old, and is still \\"puttering around down in Argentina\\", implying that his grandfather was one of the members of the SS who fled into South America. Dwight attempted to visit him once, but his travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.[12] In \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\", Michael refers to Dwight's grandmother as a \\"Nazi war criminal\\".[13] Dwight's father and grandfather are also named Dwight Schrute; however, his Amish great-grandfather was named Dwide Schrude. In \\"Casino Night\\", Dwight reveals that the tuxedo he is wearing is the one that his grandfather was buried in. In a deleted scene from \\"The Surplus\\", Dwight tells Angela that his family came to the United States on a U-boat. It is revealed in \\"Money\\" that it is a tradition in the Schrute family that when a male has intercourse with a woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats that are left on his doorstep by his parents. Dwight also speaks German, but his knowledge of it is \\"pre-industrial and mostly religious\\", as might be expected if the language was learned exclusively in a Mennonite or Amish church or context.\\r\\nDwight was shunned by his family from the age of four until his sixth birthday, for forgetting to save the excess oil from a can of tuna.[14] He lost a grade school spelling bee to Raj Patel by misspelling the word \\"failure\\", in front of the entire school.[15] In seventh grade, Dwight played the invented role of \\"Mutey the Mailman\\" in a production of Oklahoma! He explains that there were not enough roles for all of the children, so they made up roles.[16]\\r\\nDwight lives in a nine-bedroom, one-bathroom farmhouse (with the single bathroom located under the porch, as revealed in \\"Office Olympics\\") on his family's 60-acre (240,000?m2) beet farm, with his cousin Mose. The cousins sell beets to local stores, restaurants, and roadside beet stands.[17] Dwight uses part of his farm to grow hemp.[18] Dwight and Mose have also turned Schrute Farms into a ramshackle bed and breakfast, that was visited by Jim and Pam, during \\"Money\\".[19] The bed and breakfast had three theme rooms: America, Irrigation, and Nighttime. Schrute Farms was also to be the site of Andy and Angela's wedding before the two broke off their engagement. In \\"Garden Party\\", Andy throws a garden party at Schrute Farms in order to impress new CEO Robert California, and at the end of the episode, Robert also discusses the possibility of holding his birthday party at the farm.\\r\\nAccording to one of Dwight's web logs on NBC.com's \\"Schrute-Space\\", he had an uncle, named Gunther, a goat farmer, who fled the Allied invasion of Germany and married a Finnish woman, with whom he had 17 children.[20] He also had an Uncle Girt, who revealed that the Schrute family has an ongoing hatred of Harry S. Truman, because they were staunch supporters of Thomas Dewey. In another blog, he mentions a cousin named Heindl, who received numerous injuries and infections from an attack by a small dog.[21]\\r\\nDwight is trained in the art of surveillance, and is a former Lackawanna County volunteer sheriff's deputy.[6] He has a purple belt in Goju-Ryu karate, and is the senpai at his dojo.[7] Dwight is a pop culture and sci-fi enthusiast, who has expressed fanship of many sci-fi movies and popular television series. In the episode \\"The Fire\\", he mentioned the movie The Crow as being his favorite film. He hints at belief in fictional creatures such as androids, zombies and vampires (though curiously, despite having claimed in \\"Business School\\", to have shot a werewolf (that was actually his neighbor's dog), he says in one of his blog entries that he does not believe in them; however, he may have simply been denying claims of werewolves at Schrute Farms in order to prevent potential visitors from being frightened away).[21] He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing table tennis, and states that many of his heroes are table tennis players.[22] His musical tastes vary, but heavy metal and classic rock seem to be a recurring theme.[1] His personal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays guitar and recorder, and sings, as well.[13] He has a fascination with cars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially muscle cars. He drives a 1987 Pontiac Trans Am though in the Finale (The Office) he's driving a 2013 Dodge Challenger. His technological talents are limited, but he shows a passion for the online role playing game Second Life, in which the only differences between himself and his avatar is that his avatar has the last name 'Shelford' and the ability to fly.[18] He also shows an interest in trains, as he is restoring a turn-of-the-century steam engine in his slaughterhouse, during \\"The Meeting\\", which has him bonding with Toby Flenderson, as they share the same interest. In \\"Todd Packer\\", it is revealed that Dwight does not know who Justin Bieber is, asking Jim \\"Who is Justice Beaver?\\", leaving Jim to answer \\"A crime-fighting beaver.\\"\\r\\nDwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to Laser Tag and paintball equipment, he has a crossbow range at his farm (\\"Office Olympics\\") and, when he was named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch,[6] hinted that he might bring a bo staff to work. He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including pepper spray, nunchucks, throwing stars, a stun gun, a boomerang, handcuffs, a nightstick, a pair of brass knuckles and a Chinese sword, all of which were confiscated by Toby.[23] Dwight also claimed to have sat at his desk for an entire day with a spud gun, without any difficulty from Security.[6] Dwight also uses a real gun, a Colt Anaconda, fired within city limits, to start off the race in \\"Fun Run\\".[24] In \\"Branch Wars\\", he produces a disturbing number of Molotov cocktails for a panty raid on Utica. In \\"Survivor Man\\", it is revealed that Dwight still has numerous knives (and other weapons) hidden on himself (as in \\"Stress Relief\\", there is a knife strapped to his leg) or strategically positioned throughout the office (such as \\"Mr. A Knife\\" in a filing cabinet, twin sais behind a water cooler, a sword in a ceiling tile, a blow dart in a bathroom stall, and a compound bow under a couch), and that he owns a .22 rifle with scope. Also, in this episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness, being able to provide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through the scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself, although it is not clear whether the mushrooms Michael started to ingest were actually poisonous.[25]\\r\\nDwight is vocal about his views on justice, which is reflected in his television viewing habits, as he enjoys watching and has great admiration for Judge Judy, as well as Vic Mackey on The Shield. In \\"The Negotiation\\", Roy Anderson attacks Jim, because he kissed Roy's fiancee, Pam, but Dwight intercepts the attack with pepper spray.[23] Throughout the episode, Jim attempts to show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts, simply stating \\"Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens\\".[23] In \\"Drug Testing\\", Dwight finds half of a joint in the parking lot, which incites him to carry out a severe, and thorough, investigation.[6] When he discovers that Michael might have been exposed to illegal drugs at a concert, he substitutes his own urine during the mandatory drug test.[6] Dwight then resigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department, because he feels that he is no longer worthy of working there. In \\"Frame Toby\\", Dwight states that he is skilled at framing people, as well as animals, revealing that he once framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas gift, and a bear for eating out of the garbage, although, he had made it obvious to the police that he wanted Toby to be imprisoned.[6] In the episode \\"Women's Appreciation\\", he is quoted as saying \\"Better a thousand innocent men are locked up, than one guilty man roam free.\\"\\r\\nIn \\"Conflict Resolution\\", Dwight states that he does not like to smile, as showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates, and that whenever someone smiles at him, \\"all [he] sees is a chimpanzee, begging for its life\\". Dwight owns many exotic pets including piranhas, frogs, an arctic wolf, a raccoon, a porcupine named Henrietta, and an opossum, although the wolf escaped due to poor restraints and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an interest in bears, and is ready to debate the habits and characteristics of different species of bears. He also has expressed a surprisingly large affection towards baby otters.\\r\\nIn \\"Costume Contest\\", Dwight claims to be able to sit on a fence, and that he is even able to sleep on one, stating that \\"The trick is to do it face down, with the post in your mouth\\".\\r\\nIt is revealed in the \\"Suit Warehouse\\" episode that as a child Dwight collected cat feces.\\r\\nIn \\"Drug Testing\\", Dwight states that he likes his co-workers, \\"with four exceptions\\", leaving it up to the audience to make educated guesses about whom these four exceptions are. The four are most likely Jim Halpert, Ryan Howard, Meredith Palmer and Toby Flenderson, due to Michael's hatred of him. However, it is also probable that Phyllis Lapin-Vance could be one of the exceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained relationship. Kelly Kapoor is likewise a viable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character, as we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly. This theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence Angela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Halpert is also a possible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against Dwight.\\r\\nTowards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with Angela Martin. Pam begins to suspect a relationship between the two, in \\"E-mail Surveillance\\", by observing their interactions, suspicions which are strengthened in \\"The Injury\\" and \\"Conflict Resolution\\", and confirmed by \\"Traveling Salesmen\\", where Angela confides in Pam about her relationship, using code names.[1] In \\"Michael's Birthday\\", Ryan discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears a coded conversation between them in the kitchen, while in \\"The Negotiation\\" Jim discovers the relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after quitting time, to find Dwight and Angela kissing (he then tells the documentary crew that, with his silence, the debt he feels to Dwight is repaid).[23]\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Fun Run\\", Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring for the feline, Dwight feels he should kill it as a waste of resources, and then tells Angela Sprinkles was dead when he arrived.[24] When he lets the truth slip out shortly after, Angela terminates their relationship. Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight sitting alone at night, contemplating Angela's cherub figurine and moaning in anguish.[19]\\r\\nIn the fourth season finale \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", Dwight is obviously hurt when Angela's boyfriend, Andy, proposes to her. However, in the final scene of the episode, Phyllis catches Dwight having sex with Angela in the office.[26]\\r\\nIn the fifth season premiere, \\"Weight Loss\\", Dwight and Angela have resumed a covert relationship, using a storage room in the warehouse to have sex. In \\"Crime Aid\\", Andy and Angela set a date for their wedding. After some advice from Phyllis, Dwight gives Angela an ultimatum: call off the engagement, or he will no longer be with her. She chooses to marry Andy. When Andy learns about Angela's affair with Dwight, a duel between Dwight and Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been lying to them, and break up with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid each other.\\r\\nIn the season 6 episode \\"The Delivery\\", Dwight, witnessing Jim and Pam talk to customers about their unborn child, decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be the mother. They sign an elaborate contract, including eating guidelines for Angela to follow when she is pregnant, and how the baby will be raised. While Angela is excited by the reconciliation, Dwight doesn't share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in Pam's friend Isabel, he tells Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates Angela and she sues him in small-claims court. When an arbitrator tells them that the contract is valid and would involve a $30,000 settlement (because it would be illegal to force Dwight and Angela to procreate), Dwight cuts a deal with Angela for five sessions of sex. He then proceeds to abuse his genitals in an effort to sterilize himself, and fends off Angela's efforts to be romantic.\\r\\nIn Season 7, after Angela meets a state senator who she finds much more personable than Dwight, she voids the pact in WUPHF.com.\\r\\nIn \\"Jury Duty\\", it is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the state senator, Robert Lipton, Dwight and Angela had sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight believes that he is the baby's biological father.[27] In \\"New Guys\\", it is revealed that he is not the father.\\r\\nIn season 9, they become close again first when Dwight finds out that Robert is cheating on Angela with Oscar, and later in \\"Moving On\\" when Angela helps him take care of his elderly aunt. They share a kiss, but afterwards both say that she should remain faithful to her husband. After inheriting his aunt's beet farm, Dwight starts a relationship with neighboring brusselsprout farmer Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick). When Dwight seems to be getting serious with Esther and the Senator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela breaks down and admits to Oscar Martinez that she still loves Dwight. On the day that he intends to ask Esther to marry him, Dwight instead proposes to Angela. She says yes, finally admitting that he is the father of her son Phillip. (\\"A.A.R.M.\\")\\r\\nDwight holds a high level of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and often participating with Michael's ill-conceived schemes.[2] However, he betrays Michael numerous times, such as when he goes over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job in \\"The Coup\\". Despite this, Michael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his antics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from \\"Assistant to the Regional Manager\\" to \\"Assistant Regional Manager\\". In later seasons, Dwight was shown to return the favor, such as Dwight telling Michael that he would have a better career if he'd taken a job at Home Depot. Several times throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care about Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In \\"Training Day\\", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to Deangelo Vickers, and when he learns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to believe, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving Michael standing outside, by himself. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Dwight is still frustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation as Michael hands him the recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not seem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really does respect him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight, and Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored. Also, after Michael left, Dwight did not have the same respect for Deangelo and Andy that Dwight previously had for Michael, implying that Dwight truly respects and values Michael. In a deleted scene from \\"Finale\\", Dwight stated that Michael sent him his \\"World's Best Boss\\" mug when he became Regional Manager.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Finale\\", as Jim explains that the \\"Bestest Mench\\" (best man) in Dwight's wedding must be older than him, Dwight is disappointed. However, the camera reveals that Michael returned, and the two continue to engage in a friendly conversation. During the wedding, Michael is present behind Angela and Dwight getting married, eventually attending the reception. He watches as his \\"family\\" is sitting together, and is last seen dancing with Dwight.\\r\\nDwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his stapler into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. Dwight's frustration with Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in \\"Conflict Resolution\\", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is transferred.[28] Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks on Jim in turn, most prominently in \\"Classy Christmas\\" where he subjects Jim to a barrage of pranks revolving around snowballs. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award, although, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest client.[15]\\r\\nDuring \\"Initiation\\", Dwight tells Ryan he regrets that he and Jim never got along. In \\"Traveling Salesmen\\", Dwight quits and hugs Jim as a farewell which surprises Jim as he does not know that Dwight quit. Later, Jim is irritated when Andy replaces Dwight and even says that he misses Dwight. Earlier in the same episode, Jim and Dwight make an incredibly efficient sales team, functioning well as a duo and thinking similarly in their tactics. The two were paired together when they began as traveling salesmen at the company. Dwight plans to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager spot, and make him miserable, during \\"The Job\\".[29]\\r\\nDwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at times, cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's absence, sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when he is genuinely hurt or in danger (such as in \\"Money\\" and \\"Last Day in Florida\\") and occasionally compliments his successes (such as in \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\"). However, when Jim is promoted to co-manager, Dwight's enmity returns to full force, and he conducts an ongoing campaign to depose Jim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales representative in \\"Manager and Salesman\\".\\r\\nJim and Dwight team up in \\"Todd Packer\\" to remove Todd Packer after he returns to the Dunder Mifflin offices and takes Dwight's desk. The two at first cannot agree on a plan, but eventually trick Packer into thinking he has got a job offer in Tallahassee.[30]\\r\\nDuring \\"After Hours\\", Jim enlists Dwight into trying to get Kathy, an unwanted female suitor, out of his room by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In \\"Last Day in Florida\\", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including in front of the other Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before he goes in, and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.\\r\\nDuring season 9's \\"Dwight Christmas\\", Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party in the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight is noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns, Dwight embraces him in a hug. Soon after, in \\"Suit Warehouse\\", Dwight absent-mindedly says \\"love you\\" at the end of a phone conversation with Jim, much to his embarrassment and the bemusement of his coworkers.\\r\\nIn \\"Livin' the Dream\\", the 3rd-to-last episode of the series, Jim suggests to David Wallace that Dwight deserves to replace Andy Bernard as Regional Manager because Dwight loves paper more than anyone else. David agrees and Dwight is promoted to Regional Manager at the end of the episode as a result; Dwight subsequently appoints Jim to fill his old position, Assistant to the Regional Manager.\\r\\nIn the final episode of the series \\"Finale\\", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding. Jim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim refers to as \\"pranks\\"). Before the wedding Jim informs Dwight that, under Schrute tradition, he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott. The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. Later in the episode Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting so Jim can pursue a sports marketing career in Austin, but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them severance packages.\\r\\nAlthough she is often involved in Jim's pranks on Dwight, Dwight has, at certain times, displayed a curious sense of protectiveness towards her. In \\"Back from Vacation\\" and \\"Diwali\\", he comforts a tearful Pam, and in \\"China\\", he secretly allows Pam to save face when she feels vulnerable about her job abilities. In \\"The Job\\", Dwight offers Pam the position of \\"Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager\\", and following Jim's advice concerning any offers from Dwight to be involved in something secret, she accepts. Though Jim presumably meant this as the opening move of a prank, Pam instead uses it as a bonding opportunity between her and Dwight.\\r\\nThe two briefly become best friends while he suffers a concussion in \\"The Injury\\". In the season 6 episode \\"The Delivery\\", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Halperts' house to retrieve Pam's iPod, while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen, after discovering mold. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during \\"Viewing Party\\", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in \\"Doomsday\\". At this point, Pam is the only one in the office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.\\r\\nIn a talking-head interview, in the episode \\"Tallahassee\\", Dwight talks about how first impressions last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that \\"slightly rubbed [him] the wrong way\\", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode \\"The Whale\\", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his \\"best friend\\", and he ensures that she and Jim get a large severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.\\r\\nAs a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number two position to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman Andy Bernard, to gain Michael's favor for \\"third-in-command\\". The struggle comes to a climax in \\"Traveling Salesmen\\".[1] In Season 4, Andy and Dwight are shown to work well together as a sales team, but Andy's successful pursuit of Angela, after she broke up with Dwight, was irritating to him. When Andy gets engaged to Angela, Dwight is greatly upset by this, and embarks on an affair with her. This affair culminates in a short-lived fight between Andy and Dwight, when they discover Angela has lied to both of them, about not having had sex with the other. In \\"Michael Scott Paper Company,\\" they once again find themselves courting the same woman ÿ Erin Hannon. However, by the end of the fifth season, Andy and Dwight become friends, and discover they both share a mutual interest in music and hunting.[31]\\r\\nIn the beginning of the series, Dwight feels threatened by Ryan Howard, to whom Michael often assigns personal tasks. He continues to resent Ryan, throughout the second season, often addressing him as \\"Temp\\",[4] even after Ryan took over Jim's position.[12] In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's friendship with Michael was slightly torn during \\"The Fire\\", when Michael seems to be viewing Ryan more favorably than Dwight, and in \\"Performance Review\\", in which Michael must evaluate Ryan.[32] In \\"Initiation\\", Dwight decides to assist Ryan, during his first sales call, although the two get off to a rough start when Dwight hazes him in a series of bizarre initiation rituals. Soon afterwards, Dwight takes Ryan on his first meeting, which ends in disaster. Ryan then eggs the potential customer's building out of spite, and Dwight develops some respect for him.[33]\\r\\nDuring season 4, Dwight, along with Michael, comes to Ryan's rescue when they visit him in New York City, when he gets into a scuffle.\\r\\nRyan and Dwight later team up again in season 6, when Dwight plans to sabotage Jim's occupation, as branch co-manager.[34]\\r\\nA subtle running joke throughout the series is Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to \\"hook up\\" at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to brush it off. In \\"Night Out\\", Dwight hooks up with a women's basketball player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael that he will not do. In \\"Niagara\\", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's horses. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in \\"The Delivery\\" that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in \\"Happy Hour\\", and bond further, kissing at the end of the episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, Mindy Kaling noted that Dwight is not a typical \\"nerd\\" character, that he is a \\"farmer and kind of strapping and tall\\", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex. In season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick). He ultimately ends his relationship with her in \\"A.A.R.M.\\". In the final episode, Dwight marries Angela Martin.\\r\\nThe Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is often cited as one of the most popular characters on the show. According to Entertainment Weekly he is one of the \\"greatest sidekicks.\\"[35] In TV Guide's list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th. In an ABC News interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that \\"Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company...\\"[36] and \\"Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy. Dwight is a survivalist geek, a student of karate who likes to shoot a crossbow and watch \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" on television. And he takes himself very, very seriously...\\"[36] E! News commented that Rainn Wilson should be nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance of Dwight, commenting: \\"...Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now, Dwight Schrute? Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last night. My God, have I missed you, man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason I love my job, my friend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday night. You may just be an everyday citizen who does not accept prizes for being a citizen, but you'd best be accepting a supporting actor Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you don't deserve it.\\"[37]\\r\\nAnother positive review of the character was given by PopMatters, an online entertainment news site. The review stated: \\"One of the shows ironies is that Michael and Dwight, hapless though they might be within the office or in most social settings, are actually top salesmen...Undeterred, or unaware of any of this, Dwight carries on with his dreams of grandeur, even instituting a reward system called \\"Schrute Bucks\\" for employees who please him during a brief but tyrannical reign as branch manager...Dwight approaches sales with the same militaristic fervor as everything else in his life, and it pays off for him (maybe thats one of the reasons why, when Jim gives Dwight one of Benito Mussolinis speeches to deliver when he accepts a sales award in Season Two, Dwight delivers it so enthusiastically that he gets a standing ovation)...\\"[38] Metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada named a song \\"Assistant to the Regional Manager,\\" alluding to Dwight's position. In addition, the band created a T-shirt design that indirectly associates itself with Dwight by strongly resembling him. It is named \\"Guy Wearing Tie.\\"[39]\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Valentine's Day\\", Dwight is given a bobblehead doll as a Valentine's gift, from Angela. Following the episode, fans of the show petitioned NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for purchase on their online store.[40] NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000?bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.[40] The creator of the show, Greg Daniels, joked about the bobbleheads, saying \\"Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose. People who want to manage by consensus can buy six and keep them nodding all the time to whatever they say.\\"[40] In 2010 Hallmark released a smaller talking version of the doll as part of their 2010 Christmas Keepsake Ornament selection.\\r\\nIn \\"Halloween\\", Jim and Pam uploaded Dwight's resume to \\"Monster.com, Craigslist, and Google.\\"[41] A producer actually did create a Monster account for Dwight and uploaded his rsum a month before the episode aired. It can be found by employers with resume database access who search for salesmen in Scranton, Pennsylvania.[42] The rsum stated that he was willing to relocate to another state,[42] wanted a salary close to $30,000 (USD),[42] desired the job title of Regional Manager,[42] was currently \\"Assistant to the Regional Manager\\",[42] and had a Bachelor's Degree.[42] The posted rsum also stated: \\"My time spent at Dunder Mifflin was very enjoying. I had the opportunity to learn from an experienced and talented boss. My branch consistently was one of the top sellers of the company...\\"[42]\\r\\nIn \\"Money\\", Pam refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms.[43] Jim and Pam discover that Dwight is running the Schrute Farm as an \\"agritourism\\" bed and breakfast. They spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making, and distributing manure. That night, however, Jim hears an unnerving moaning sound throughout the night, later shown to be Dwight in his room crying over his breakup with Angela. The TripAdvisor page said:\\r\\n\\"Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related agritourism destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest accommodations for the casual traveler and/or radish enthusiast. Come join us and experience majestic Schrute Farms.\\"[43]\\r\\nJim and Pam (\\"JandP2\\") also posted a review, which can be seen on the reviews page. It read: \\"The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff's attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.\\"[43]\\r\\nAn angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her cat as a main cause for the review. It said: \\"I have to warn people about the proprietor of Schrute Farmshe may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he might do to you or your loved ones...\\"[43]\\r\\nAccording to Dwight, during the Civil War, while the Battle of Gettysburg was known for having the most deaths, the battle of Schrute Farms was known for having the highest DPA (deaths per acre). He also claimed it was the northernmost battle during the Civil War. However, in reality, it was actually a safe haven for men who wanted relief from the war to focus on artistic lifestyles. It is insinuated that this was a camp for homosexual soldiers. Melvin Fifer Garris is the only known soldier to write home from Schrute Farms during the Civil War.\\r\\nOn the May 7, 2008, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, US Senator and Republican Party presidential nominee John McCain joked that Dwight Schrute would be his vice presidential candidate choice.[44][45] Rainn Wilson appeared on The Tonight Show on May 14, 2008, and read to Jay Leno a list of demands from Dwight in exchange for being vice president.[46] Included in this list was being able to pilot Air Force One at any time, and only to be addressed as \\"Iceman\\" while piloting.[46] He also demanded that Jack Bauer be immediately promoted to United States Secretary of Defense, his bunker to include a foosball table and be zombie-proof, and that the Secret Service members be armed with nunchakus, throwing stars, and flamethrowers.[46] Finally, he demanded a flamethrower, an Iron Man suit, and that fellow character Michael Scott be an \\"ambassador to Hawaii.\\"[46]\\r\\nResearchers at Brigham Young University, Stanford and Northwestern University demonstrated that social outsiders, similar to Dwight's character, lead to better group decision making. Media accounts of their published study reported that having a Dwight Schrute around is good for business. Dwight was included in articles about the research by Time magazine,[47] Toronto Globe and Mail,[48] The Salt Lake Tribune[49] and Brigham Young University.[50]\\r\\nOn January 25, 2012, news broke that NBC was planning a spin-off series, starring Wilson as Dwight, that would be set at Schrute Farms, Dwight's bed-and-breakfast and beet farm.[51] The spin-off was to have been created by Wilson and executive producer Paul Lieberstein, but Office developer Greg Daniels would not have been involved.[51] The series was in the works for a premiere in early 2013, and would have caused Wilson to leave The Office during the ninth season.[51] The spin-off was scheduled to have been introduced as a backdoor pilot in a later episode of the ninth season.[51] Despite the news report, Wilson tweeted \\"Don't believe everything you read in the press, OK?\\".[52] In October 2012, NBC announced that it was not accepting the spin-off series.[53]","input":"What type of car does dwight schrute drive?"},{"output":"Aaron","context":"\\r\\nFour gifts given in Jerusalem\\r\\n11.

Parts of the thank offering and Nazirite's offering\\r\\nThis page gives one list of the High Priests of Ancient Israel up to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. Because of a lack of historical data, this list is incomplete and there may be gaps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe High Priests, like all Levitical priests, belonged to the Aaronic line. The Bible mentions the majority of high priests before the captivity, but does not give a complete list of office holders. Lists would be based on various historical sources. In several periods of gentile rule, high priests were appointed and removed by kings. Still, most high priests came from the Aaronic line. One exception is Menelaus, who may not have been from the Tribe of Levi at all, but from the Tribe of Benjamin.\\r\\nThe following section is based on information found in the various books of the Bible, including the genealogies given in First Book of Chronicles and the Book of Ezra, the works of Josephus[1] and the early-medieval Seder Olam Zutta.\\r\\nThough Phinehas and his descendants are not directly attested as high priests, this portion of the genealogy given in 1 Chronicles 5:30-41 is assumed by other sources (including Josephus [2] and Seder 'Olam Zutta), to give the succession of the office from father to son. At some time, the office was transferred from descendants of Eleazar to those of his brother Itamar.[3] The first known and most notable high priest of Itamar's line was Eli, a contemporary of Samuel.\\r\\nAbiathar was removed from the high priesthood for conspiring against King Solomon, and was replaced by Zadok, son of Ahitub, who oversaw the construction of the First Temple. According to the genealogies given in 1 Chronicles 5:30-34, Zadok was a descendant of Uzzi (through Zerahiah, Meraioth, Amariah and Ahitub) and thus belonged to the line of Eleazar.\\r\\nFrom Solomon's time until the captivity, the High Priests officiated in Temple of Jerusalem. Information about who served in that office diverges between the Bible, Josephus and the Seder 'Olam Zuta. While Josephus and Seder 'Olam Zuta each mention 18 high priests,[4] the genealogy given 1 Chronicles 5:34-41 gives twelve names, culminating in the last high priest Seriah, father of Jehozadak. However, it is unclear whether all those mentioned in the genealogy between Zadok and Jehozadak were high priests and whether high priests mentioned elsewhere (such as Jehoiada and Jehoiarib) are simply omitted or did not belong to the male line in this genealogy.\\r\\nSome name Jehozadak, son of Seriah, as a high priest prior to being sent to captivity in Babylonia, based on the biblical references to \\"Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest\\". According to Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi), this is a misreading of the phrase, as \\"the high priest\\" does not refer to Jehozadak, who was exiled to Babylon without having served as high priest, but to his son Joshua, who ascended from Babylon at the end of the exile.[7]\\r\\nThe five descendants of Joshua are mentioned in Nehemiah, chapter 12, 10f. The chronology given above, based on Josephus, however is not undisputed, with some alternatively placing Jaddua during the time of Darius II and some supposing one more Johanan and one more Jaddua in the following time, the latter Jaddua being contemporary of Alexander the Great.\\r\\nInter-Sacerdotium: It is unknown who held the position of High Priest of Jerusalem between Alcimus' death and the accession of Jonathan. Josephus, in Jewish Antiquities XX.10, relates that the office was vacant for seven years, but this is highly unlikely, if not impossible. In religious terms, the High Priest was a necessary part of the rites on the Day of Atonement, a day that could have not been allowed to pass uncelebrated for so long so soon after the restoration of the Temple service. Politically, Israel's overlords probably would not have allowed a power vacuum to last that length of time.\\r\\nIn another passage (XII.10 6, XII.11 2) Josephus suggests that Judas Maccabeus, the brother of Jonathan, held the office for three years, succeeding Alcimus. However, Judas actually predeceased Alcimus by one year. The nature of Jonathan's accession to the high priesthood makes it unlikely that Judas held that office during the inter-sacerdotium. The Jewish Encyclopedia tries to harmonise the contradictions found in Josephus by supposing that Judas held the office \\"immediately after the consecration of the Temple (165-162), that is, before the election of Alcimus\\"[9]\\r\\nIt has been argued that the founder of the Qumran community, the Teacher of Righteousness (Moreh Zedek), was High Priest (but not necessarily the sole occupant) during the inter-sacerdotium and was driven off by Jonathan.","input":"Who became the first high priest of israel?"},{"output":"The Church of England","context":"The Church of England (C of E) is the state church of England.[3][4][5] The Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) is the most senior cleric, although the monarch is the supreme governor. The Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the Roman province of Britain by the third century, and to the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury.[6][7][8]\\r\\nThe English church renounced papal authority when Henry?VIII failed to secure an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in the 1530s.[9] The English Reformation accelerated under Edward?VI's regents, before a brief restoration of papal authority under Queen Mary I and King Philip. The Act of Supremacy 1558 renewed the breach and the Elizabethan Settlement charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both Catholic and Reformed:\\r\\nIn the earlier phase of the English Reformation there were both Catholic martyrs and radical Protestant martyrs. The later phases saw the Penal Laws punish Roman Catholic and nonconforming Protestants. In the 17th century, political and religious disputes raised the Puritan and Presbyterian faction to control of the church, but this ended with the Restoration. Papal recognition of George?III in 1766 led to greater religious tolerance.\\r\\nSince the English Reformation, the Church of England has used a liturgy in English. The church contains several doctrinal strands, the main three known as Anglo-Catholic, Evangelical and Broad Church. Tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the ordination of women and homosexuality. The church includes both liberal and conservative clergy and members.[11]\\r\\nThe governing structure of the church is based on dioceses, each presided over by a bishop. Within each diocese are local parishes. The General Synod of the Church of England is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops, other clergy and laity. Its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to tradition, Christianity arrived in Britain in the 1st or 2nd century, during which time southern Britain became part of the Roman Empire. The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native Britons is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as Tertullian and Origen in the first years of the 3rd century. Three Romano-British bishops, including Restitutus, are known to have been present at the Council of Arles in 314.[12] Others attended the Council of Sardica in 347 and that of Ariminum in 360, and a number of references to the church in Roman Britain are found in the writings of 4th century Christian fathers. Britain was the home of Pelagius, who opposed Augustine of Hippo's doctrine of original sin.[13]\\r\\nWhile Christianity was long established as the religion of the Britons at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their native paganism. Consequently, in 597, Pope Gregory I sent the prior of the Abbey of St Andrew's (later canonised as Augustine of Canterbury) from Rome to evangelise the Angles. This event is known as the Gregorian mission and is the date the Church of England generally marks as the beginning of its formal history. With the help of Christians already residing in Kent, Augustine established his church at Canterbury, the capital of the Kingdom of Kent, and became the first in the series of Archbishops of Canterbury in 598. A later archbishop, the Greek Theodore of Tarsus, also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England. The Church of England has been in continuous existence since the days of St Augustine, with the Archbishop of Canterbury as its episcopal head. Despite the various disruptions of the Reformation and the English Civil War, the Church of England considers itself to be the same church which was more formally organised by Augustine.[6]\\r\\nWhile some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the Synod of Whitby, the Christian in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.[14] Queen Bertha of Kent was among the Christians in England who recognised papal authority before Augustine arrived,[15] and Celtic Christians were carrying out missionary work with papal approval long before the Synod of Whitby.\\r\\nThe Synod of Whitby established the Roman date for Easter and the Roman style of monastic tonsure in England. This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman customs with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Strean?shalch), later called Whitby Abbey. It was presided over by King Oswiu, who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling.\\r\\nIn 1534, King Henry VIII separated the English Church from Rome.[9] A theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the English Church, such as Lollardy, but the English Reformation gained political support when Henry VIII wanted an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon so he could marry Anne Boleyn. Pope Clement VII, considering that the earlier marriage had been entered under a papal dispensation and how Catherine's nephew, Emperor Charles V, might react to such a move, refused the annulment. Eventually, Henry, although theologically opposed to Protestantism, took the position of Supreme Head of the Church of England to ensure the annulment of his marriage. He was excommunicated by Pope Paul III.[16]\\r\\nIn 1536ÿ40 Henry VIII engaged in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which controlled much of the richest land. He disbanded monasteries, priories, convents and friaries in England, Wales and Ireland, appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided pensions for the former residents. The properties were sold to pay for the wars. Bernard argues:\\r\\nHenry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and, during his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw the trial for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.\\r\\nUnder his son, King Edward VI, more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the Book of Common Prayer (1549 and 1552). These were based on the older liturgy but influenced by Protestant principles. The confession of the reformed Church of England was set out in the Forty-two Articles (later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king. Queen Mary I, who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of the papacy, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England. During her co-reign with her husband, King Philip, many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith. These are known as the Marian martyrs and the persecution led to her nickname of \\"Bloody Mary\\".\\r\\nMary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half-sister Elizabeth to resolve the direction of the church. The settlement under Queen Elizabeth I (from 1558), known as the Elizabethan Settlement, developed the via media (middle way) character of the Church of England, a church moderately Reformed in doctrine, as expressed in the Thirty-Nine Articles, but also emphasising continuity with the Catholic and Apostolic traditions of the Church Fathers. It was also an established church (constitutionally established by the state with the head of state as its supreme governor). The exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century.\\r\\nFor the next century, through the reigns of James I, who ordered the creation of what became known as the King James Bible,[18] and Charles I, culminating in the English Civil War and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the Puritans (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching Protestant reforms, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By Continental standards, the level of violence over religion was not high, but the casualties included King Charles I and the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud. Under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660, the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed, and Presbyterian ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate. The 39 Articles were replaced by the Westminster Confession, the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism.\\r\\nWith the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with the Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and those Puritans and Protestants who dissented from the Anglican establishment, and Roman Catholics, too strong to be suppressed altogether, having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than controlling it. Continuing official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century.\\r\\nBy the Fifth Article of the Union with Ireland 1800, the Church of England and Church of Ireland were united into \\"one Protestant Episcopal church, to be called, the United Church of England and Ireland\\".[19] Although this union was declared \\"an essential and fundamental Part of the Union\\",[20] the Irish Church Act 1869 separated the Irish part of the church again and disestablished it, the Act coming into effect on 1 January 1871.\\r\\nAs the British Empire expanded, British colonists and colonial administrators took the established church doctrines and practices together with ordained ministry and formed overseas branches of the Church of England. As they developed or, beginning with the United States of America, became sovereign or independent states, many of their churches became separate organisationally but remained linked to the Church of England through the Anglican Communion.\\r\\nIn Bermuda, the oldest remaining English colony (now designated a British Overseas Territory), the first Church of England services were performed by the Reverend Richard Buck, one of the survivors of the 1609 wreck of the Sea Venture which initiated Bermuda's permanent settlement. The nine parishes of the Church of England in Bermuda, each with its own church and glebe land, rarely had more than a pair of ordained ministers to share between them until the Nineteenth Century. From 1825 to 1839, Bermuda's parishes were attached to the See of Nova Scotia. Bermuda was then grouped into the new Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda from 1839. In 1879, the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed. At the same time, a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but both continued to be grouped under the Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own Bishop.\\r\\nThe Church of England in Bermuda was renamed in 1978 as the Anglican Church of Bermuda, which is an extra-provincial diocese,[21] with both metropolitan and primatial authority coming directly from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Among its parish churches is St Peter's Church in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of St George's Town, which is both the oldest Anglican and the oldest non-Roman Catholic church in the New World.\\r\\nUnder the guidance of Rowan Williams and with significant pressure from clergy union representatives, the ecclesiastical penalty for convicted felons to be defrocked was set aside from the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003. The clergy union argued that the penalty was unfair to victims of hypothetical miscarriages of criminal justice, because the ecclesiastical penalty is considered irreversible. Although clerics can still be banned for life from ministry, they remain ordained as priests.[22]\\r\\nThe archbishops of Canterbury and York warned in January 2015 that the Church of England will no longer be able to carry on in its current form unless the downward spiral in membership is somehow reversed as typical Sunday attendances have halved to 800,000 in the last 40 years:[23]\\r\\nThe urgency of the challenge facing us is not in doubt. Attendance at Church of England services has declined at an average of one per cent per annum over recent decades and, in addition, the age profile of our membership has become significantly older than that of the population... Renewing and reforming aspects of our institutional life is a necessary but far from sufficient response to the challenges facing the Church of England... The age profile of our clergy has also been increasing. Around 40 per cent of parish clergy are due to retire over the next decade or so.\\r\\nHowever, Sarah Mullally, the fourth woman chosen to become a bishop in the Church of England, insisted in June 2015 that declining numbers at services should not necessarily be a cause of despair for churches because people will still \\"encounter God\\" without ever taking their place in a pew, saying that people might hear the Christian message through social media sites such as Facebook or in a caf run as a community project.[24] Additionally, the church's own statistics reveal that 9.7 million people visit an Anglican church every year and 1 million students are educated at Anglican schools.[25]\\r\\nIn 2015 the Church of England admitted that it was embarrassed to be paying staff under the living wage. The Church of England had previously campaigned for all employers to pay this minimum amount. The archbishop acknowledged it was not the only area where the church \\"fell short of its standards\\".[26]\\r\\nThe canon law of the Church of England identifies the Christian scriptures as the source of its doctrine. In addition, doctrine is also derived from the teachings of the Church Fathers and ecumenical councils (as well as the ecumenical creeds) in so far as these agree with scripture. This doctrine is expressed in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal containing the rites for the ordination of deacons, priests, and the consecration of bishops.[27] Unlike other traditions, the Church of England has no single theologian that it can look to as a founder. However, Richard Hooker's appeal to scripture, church tradition, and reason as sources of authority continue to inform Anglican identity.[28]\\r\\nThe Church of England's doctrinal character today is largely the result of the Elizabethan Settlement, which sought to establish a comprehensive middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The Church of England affirms the Protestant Reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters. The Thirty-nine Articles are the church's only official confessional statement. Though not a complete system of doctrine, the articles highlight areas of agreement with Lutheran and Reformed positions, while differentiating Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism and Anabaptism.[28]\\r\\nWhile embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation. The Church of England also preserves Catholic order by adhering to episcopal polity, with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church.[28]\\r\\nThe Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and \\"open-mindedness\\". This tolerance has allowed Anglicans who emphasise the Catholic tradition and others who emphasise the Reformed tradition to coexist. The three \\"parties\\" (see Churchmanship) in the Church of England are sometimes called high church (or Anglo-Catholic), low church (or evangelical Anglican) and broad church (or liberal). The high church party places importance on the Church of England's continuity with the pre-Reformation Catholic Church, adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the sacerdotal nature of the priesthood. As their name suggests, Anglo-Catholics maintain many traditional Catholic practices and liturgical forms.[29] The low church party is more Protestant in both ceremony and theology.[30] Historically, broad church has been used to describe those of middle-of-the-road ceremonial preferences who lean theologically towards liberal Protestantism.[31] The balance between these strands of churchmanship is not static: in 2013, 40% of Church of England worshippers attended evangelical churches (compared with 26% in 1989), and 83% of very large congregations were evangelical. Such churches were also reported to attract higher numbers of men and young adults than others.[32]\\r\\nThe Church of England's official book of liturgy as established in English Law is the Book of Common Prayer. In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for a modern liturgical book, Common Worship, dating from 2000, which can be used as an alternative to the BCP. Like its predecessor, the 1980 Alternative Service Book, it differs from the Book of Common Prayer in providing a range of alternative services, mostly in modern language, although it does include some BCP-based forms as well, for example Order Two for Holy Communion. (This is a revision of the BCP service, altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the Agnus Dei before communion.) The Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship.\\r\\nThe liturgies are organised according to the traditional liturgical year and the calendar of saints. The sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist are generally thought necessary to salvation. Infant baptism is practised. At a later age, individuals baptised as infants receive confirmation by a bishop, at which time they reaffirm the baptismal promises made by their parents or sponsors. The Eucharist, consecrated by a thanksgiving prayer including Christ's Words of Institution, is believed to be \\"a memorial of Christ's once-for-all redemptive acts in which Christ is objectively present and effectually received in faith\\".[33]\\r\\nThe use of hymns and music in the Church of England has changed dramatically over the centuries. Traditional Choral evensong is a staple of most cathedrals.[citation needed] The style of psalm chanting harks back to the Church of England's pre-reformation roots. During the 18th century, clergy such as Charles Wesley introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns.\\r\\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the Charismatic Movement significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes, primarily affecting those of evangelical persuasion. These churches now adopt a contemporary worship form of service, with minimal liturgical or ritual elements, and incorporating contemporary worship music.\\r\\nWomen were appointed as deaconesses from 1861 but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy. Women have been lay readers for a long time. During the First World War, some women were appointed as lay readers, known as \\"bishop's messengers\\", who also led missions and ran churches in the absence of men. After that no more lay readers were appointed until 1969.\\r\\nLegislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986 and they were first ordained in 1987. The ordination of women as priests was passed by the General Synod in 1992 and began in 1994. In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Church of England, more women than men were ordained as priests (290 women and 273 men).[34]\\r\\nIn July 2005, the synod voted to \\"set in train\\" the process of allowing the consecration of women as bishops. In February 2006, the synod voted overwhelmingly for the \\"further exploration\\" of possible arrangements for parishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a bishop who is a woman.[35] On 7 July 2008, the synod voted to approve the ordination of women as bishops and rejected moves for alternative episcopal oversight for those who do not accept the ministry of bishops who are women.[36] Actual ordinations of women to the episcopate required further legislation, which was narrowly rejected in a vote at General Synod in November 2012.[37][38]\\r\\nOn 20 November 2013, the General Synod voted overwhelmingly in support of a plan to allow the ordination of women as bishops, with 378 in favour, 8 against and 25 abstentions.[39]\\r\\nOn 14 July 2014, the General Synod approved the ordination of women as bishops. The House of Bishops recorded 37 votes in favour, two against with one abstention. The House of Clergy had 162 in favour, 25 against and four abstentions. The House of Laity voted 152 for, 45 against with five abstentions.[40] This legislation had to be approved by the Ecclesiastical Committee of the Parliament before it could be finally implemented at the November 2014 synod.\\r\\nIn December 2014, Libby Lane was announced as the first woman to become a bishop in the Church of England. She was consecrated as a bishop in January 2015.[41] [42]\\r\\nIn July 2015, Rachel Treweek was the first woman to become a diocesan bishop in the Church of England when she became the Bishop of Gloucester.[43] She and Sarah Mullally, Bishop of Crediton, were the first women to be ordained as bishops at Canterbury Cathedral.[43] Treweek later made headlines by calling for gender-inclusive language, saying that \\"God is not to be seen as male. God is God.\\"[44]\\r\\nAfter the consecration of the first women as bishops, Women and the Church (WATCH), a group supporting the ministries of women in the Church of England, called for language referring to God as \\"Mother\\".[45] This call for more gender inclusive language has receive the outspoken support of the Rt Rev Alan Wilson, the Bishop of Buckingham.[46] In 2015, the Rev Jody Stowell, from WATCH, expressed her support for female images saying \\"we're not restricted to understanding God with one gender. I would encourage people to explore those kinds of images. They're wholly Biblical.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe Church of England has been discussing same-sex marriages and LGBT clergy.[48] The church holds that marriage is a union of one man with one woman,[49] however \\"Same-sex relationships often embody genuine mutuality and fidelity.\\"[50] The \\"Church of England does not conduct Civil Partnership Ceremonies or Same Sex Marriages but individual churches can conduct a service of thanksgiving after a ceremony.\\"[51] Within guidelines, \\"the law prevents ministers of the Church of England from carrying out same-sex marriages. And although there are no authorised services for blessing a same-sex civil marriage, your local church can still support you with prayer.\\"[52] The Archbishops' Council said that \\"clergy in the Church of England are permitted to offer prayers of support on a pastoral basis for people in same-sex relationships;\\"[53] As such, many Anglican churches, with clergy open to it, \\"already bless same-sex couples on an unofficial basis.\\"[54][55]\\r\\nCivil Partnerships for clergy have been allowed since 2005.[56][57] By 2010, the General Synod voted in favour of extending pensions and other employee rights to clergy in civil unions.[58] In a missive to clergy, the church communicated that \\"there was a need for committed same-sex couples to be given recognition and 'compassionate attention' from the Church, including special prayers.\\"[59] Some congregations have published \\"Prayers for a Same Sex Commitment.\\"[60] After same-sex marriage was legalised, the Archbishops' Council asked for the government to continue to offer civil unions saying \\"The Church of England recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality ... Civil partnerships enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework.\\"[61]\\r\\nIn 2014, the Bishops released guidelines that permit \\"more informal kind of prayer\\" for couples.[62] Some congregations invite same-sex couples to receive \\"services of thanksgiving\\" after a civil marriage.[63] In the guidelines, \\"gay couples who get married will be able to ask for special prayers in the Church of England after their wedding, the bishops have agreed.\\"[64] In 2016, The Bishop of Grantham, the Rt Rev Nicholas Chamberlain, announced he is gay, in a same-sex relationship and celibate; becoming the first bishop to do so in the church.[65] The church had decided in 2013 that gay clergy in civil partnerships could become bishops.[57][66] The House [of Bishops] has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate.\\"[67]\\r\\nIn 2017, the House of Clergy voted against the motion to 'take note' of the Bishops' report defining marriage as between a man and a woman.[68] Due to passage in all three houses being required for passage, the motion was rejected.[69] After General Synod rejected the motion, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York called for \\"radical new Christian inclusion\\" that is \\"based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st century understanding of being human and of being sexual.\\"[70] The Diocese of Hereford approved a motion calling for the church \\"to create a set of formal services and prayers to bless those who have had a same-sex marriage or civil partnership.\\"[71]\\r\\nRegarding transgender issues, the 2017 General Synod voted in favour of a motion saying that transgender people should be welcomed and affirmed in their parish church...[72][73] The motion also asked the Bishops \\"to look into special services for transgender people.\\"[74] The Diocese of Blackburn has already begun recognising the ceremony.[75] Since 2000, the church has allowed priests to undergo gender transition and remain in office.[76] The church has ordained openly transgender clergy since 2005.[77]\\r\\nJust as the Church of England has a large conservative or \\"traditionalist\\" wing, it also has many liberal members and clergy. Approximately one third of clergy \\"doubt or disbelieve in the physical resurrection\\".[78] Others, such as the Revd Giles Fraser, a contributor to The Guardian, have argued for an allegorical interpretation of the virgin birth of Jesus.[79] The Independent reported in 2014 that, according to a YouGov survey of Church of England clergy, \\"as many as 16 per cent are unclear about God and two per cent think it is no more than a human construct.\\"[80][81] Moreover, many congregations are seeker-friendly environments. For example, one report from the Church Mission Society suggested that the church open up \\"a pagan church where Christianity [is] very much in the centre\\" to reach out to spiritual people.[82]\\r\\nThe Church of England is generally opposed to abortion but recognises that \\"there can be - strictly limited - conditions under which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative\\".[83] The church also opposes euthanasia. Its official stance is that \\"While acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved in assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia, the Church of England is opposed to any change in the law or in medical practice that would make assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia permissible in law or acceptable in practice.\\" It also states that \\"Equally, the Church shares the desire to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, but believes that assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia are not acceptable means of achieving these laudable goals.\\"[84] However, George Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, announced that he had changed his stance on euthanasia in 2014 and now advocated legalising \\"assisted dying\\".[85] On embryonic stem-cell research, the church has announced \\"cautious acceptance to the proposal to produce cytoplasmic hybrid embryos for research\\".[86]\\r\\nThe Church of England set up the Church Urban Fund in the 1980s to tackle poverty and deprivation. They see poverty as trapping individuals and communities with some people in urgent need. This leads to dependency, homelessness, hunger, isolation, low income, mental health problems, social exclusion and violence. They feel that poverty reduces confidence and life expectancy and that people born in poor conditions have difficulty escaping their disadvantaged circumstances.[87]\\r\\nIn parts of Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle two-thirds of babies are born to poverty and have poorer life chances, also life expectancy 15 years lower than babies born in most fortunate communities. South Shore, Blackpool, has lowest life expectancy at 66 years for men.[88]\\r\\nThe deep-rooted unfairness in our society is highlighted by these stark statistics. Children being born in this country, just a few miles apart, couldn't witness a more wildly differing start to life. In child poverty terms, we live in one of the most unequal countries in the western world. We want people to understand where their own community sits alongside neighbouring communities. The disparity is often shocking but it's crucial that, through greater awareness, people from all backgrounds come together to think about what could be done to support those born into poverty. [Paul Hackwood, the Chair of Trustees at Church Urban Fund][89]\\r\\nMany prominent people in the Church of England have spoken out against poverty and welfare cuts in the United Kingdom. Twenty-seven bishops are among 43 Christian leaders who signed a letter which urged David Cameron to make sure people have enough to eat.\\r\\nWe often hear talk of hard choices. Surely few can be harder than that faced by the tens of thousands of older people who must 'heat or eat' each winter, harder than those faced by families whose wages have stayed flat while food prices have gone up 30% in just five years. Yet beyond even this we must, as a society, face up to the fact that over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system, whether it be payment delays or punitive sanctions.[90]\\r\\nBenefit cuts, failures and \\"punitive sanctions\\" force thousands of UK citizens to use food banks. The campaign to end hunger considers this \\"truly shocking\\" and called for a national day of fasting on 4 April 2014.[90]\\r\\nOfficial figures from 2005 showed there were 25 million baptised Anglicans in England and Wales.[91] Due to its status as the established church, in general, anyone may be married, have their children baptised or their funeral in their local parish church, regardless of whether they are baptised or regular churchgoers.[92]\\r\\nBetween 1890 and 2001, churchgoing in the United Kingdom declined steadily.[93] In the years 1968 to 1999, Anglican Sunday church attendances almost halved, from 3.5 per cent of the population to 1.9 per cent.[94] By the year 2014, Sunday church attendances had declined further to 1.4 per cent of the population.[95] One study published in 2008 suggested that if current trends were to continue, Sunday attendances could fall to 350,000 in 2030 and just 87,800 in 2050.[96]\\r\\nIn 2011, the Church of England published statistics showing 1.7 million people attending at least one of its services each month, a level maintained since the turn of the millennium; approximately one million participating each Sunday and three million taking part in a Church of England service on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve. The church also claimed that 30% attend Sunday worship at least once a year; more than 40% attend a wedding in their local church and still more attend a funeral there.[97] Nationally the Church of England baptises one child in ten (2011).[98] In 2015, the church's statistics showed that 2.6 million people attended a special Advent service, 2.4 million attended a Christmas service, 1.3 million attended an Easter service, and 980,000 attended service during an average week.[99] In 2016, 2.6 million people attended a Christmas service, 1.2 million attended an Easter service, 1.1 million people attended a service in the Church of England each month, an average of 930,000 people attended a weekly service, an additional 180,000 attended a service for school each week, and an average of 740,000 people attended Sunday service.[100]\\r\\nThe Church of England has 18,000 active ordained clergy and 10,000 licensed lay ministers.[101] In 2009, 491 people were recommended for ordination training, maintaining the level at the turn of the millennium, and 564 new clergy (266 women and 298 men) were ordained. More than half of those ordained (193 men and 116 women) were appointed to full-time paid ministry.[102] In 2011, 504 new clergy were ordained, including 264 to paid ministry, and 349 lay readers were admitted to ministry; and the mode age-range of those recommended for ordination training had remained 40ÿ49 since 1999.[103]\\r\\nArticle XIX ('Of the Church') of the 39 Articles defines the church as follows:\\r\\nThe visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.[104]\\r\\nThe British monarch has the constitutional title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The canon law of the Church of England states, \\"We acknowledge that the Queen's most excellent Majesty, acting according to the laws of the realm, is the highest power under God in this kingdom, and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil.\\"[105] In practice this power is often exercised through Parliament and the Prime Minister.\\r\\nThe Church of Ireland and the Church in Wales separated from the Church of England in 1869[106] and 1920[107] respectively and are autonomous churches in the Anglican Communion; Scotland's national church, the Church of Scotland, is Presbyterian but the Scottish Episcopal Church is in the Anglican Communion.[108]\\r\\nIn addition to England, the jurisdiction of the Church of England extends to the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and a few parishes in Flintshire, Monmouthshire, Powys and Radnorshire in Wales which voted to remain with the Church of England rather than joining the Church in Wales.[109] Expatriate congregations on the continent of Europe have become the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe.\\r\\nThe church is structured as follows (from the lowest level upwards):\\r\\nAll rectors and vicars are appointed by patrons, who may be private individuals, corporate bodies such as cathedrals, colleges or trusts, or by the bishop or directly by the Crown. No clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty, and taking the Oath of Canonical Obedience \\"in all things lawful and honest\\" to the bishop. Usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the possession of the benefice propertychurch and parsonage. Curates (assistant clergy) are appointed by rectors and vicars, or if priests-in-charge by the bishop after consultation with the patron. Cathedral clergy (normally a dean and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter) are appointed either by the Crown, the bishop, or by the dean and chapter themselves. Clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed, or simply with permission.\\r\\nThe most senior bishop of the Church of England is the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is the metropolitan of the southern province of England, the Province of Canterbury. He has the status of Primate of All England. He is the focus of unity for the worldwide Anglican Communion of independent national or regional churches. Justin Welby has been Archbishop of Canterbury since the confirmation of his election on 4 February 2013.[110]\\r\\nThe second most senior bishop is the Archbishop of York, who is the metropolitan of the northern province of England, the Province of York. For historical reasons (relating to the time of York's control by the Danes) he is referred to as the Primate of England. John Sentamu became Archbishop of York in 2005. The Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester are ranked in the next three positions.\\r\\nThe process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex, due to historical reasons balancing hierarchy against democracy, and is handled by the Crown Nominations Committee which submits names to the Prime Minister (acting on behalf of the Crown) for consideration.\\r\\nThe Church of England has a legislative body, the General Synod. Synod can create two types of legislation, measures and canons. Measures have to be approved but cannot be amended by the British Parliament before receiving the Royal Assent and becoming part of the law of England.[111] Although it is the established church in England only, its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament including the non-English members. Canons require Royal Licence and Royal Assent, but form the law of the church, rather than the law of the land.[112]\\r\\nAnother assembly is the Convocation of the English Clergy, which is older than the General Synod and its predecessor the Church Assembly. By the 1969 Synodical Government Measure almost all of the Convocations' functions were transferred to the General Synod. Additionally, there are Diocesan Synods and deanery synods, which are the governing bodies of the divisions of the Church.\\r\\nOf the 42 diocesan archbishops and bishops in the Church of England, 26 are permitted to sit in the House of Lords. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York automatically have seats, as do the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester. The remaining 21 seats are filled in order of seniority by consecration. It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords, at which point he becomes a Lord Spiritual. The Bishop of Sodor and Man and the Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords as their dioceses lie outside the United Kingdom.[113]\\r\\nAlthough they are not part of England or the United Kingdom, the Church of England is also the Established Church in the Crown dependencies of the Isle of Man, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The Isle of Man has its own diocese of Sodor and Man, and the Bishop of Sodor and Man is an ex officio member of the Legislative Council of the Tynwald on the island.[114] The Channel Islands are part of the Diocese of Winchester, and in Jersey the Dean of Jersey is a non-voting member of the States of Jersey. In Guernsey the Church of England is the Established Church, although the Dean of Guernsey is not a member of the States of Guernsey.[115]\\r\\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has taken strong action in an effort to prevent complaints of sex abuse cases being covered up. Independent investigators are examining files as far back as the 1950s and Welby hopes this independence will prevent any possibility of a cover-up.[116]\\r\\nWe will systematically bring those transparently and openly first of all working with the survivors where they are still alive and then seeing what they want. The rule is survivors come first, not our own interests, and however important the person was, however distinguished, however well-known, survivors come first. (Justin Welby)\\r\\nThe personal files of all Anglican clergy since the 1950s are being audited in an effort to ensure no cover-up. Welby emphasised repeatedly that no cover-up would be acceptable.[117]\\r\\nDespite such assurances there is concern that not enough may be done and historic abuse may still sometimes be covered up. Keith Porteous Wood of the National Secular Society stated:\\r\\nThe problem wasn't that bishops weren't trained in such matters, it is the institutional culture of denial and the bullying of the abused and whistleblowers into silence. One report suggests that 13 bishops ignored letters written in the 1990s warning of abuse by Ball on behalf of a victim who later committed suicide. I have seen evidence that such bullying persists to this day. I hope that the Archbishop's review into the case of Peter Ball will deal with such bullying and what appears to be the undue influence exerted on the police and CPS by the Church in dealing with this case. The total failure of procedures, outlined by Ian Elliott, echoes that revealed in the totally damning Cahill Report about the conduct of the Archbishop Hope of York in respect of Robert Waddington. The current Archbishop of York has decided that this report should remain in printed form rather than be more widely available on the web.[118]\\r\\nBishop Peter Ball was convicted in October 2015 on several charges of indecent assault against young adult men.[119] There are allegations of large-scale earlier cover-ups involving many British establishment figures which prevented Ball's earlier prosecution. There have also been allegations of child sex abuse, for example Robert Waddington. A complainant, known only as \\"Joe\\", tried for decades to have action taken over sadistic sex abuse which Garth Moore perpetrated against him in 1976 when \\"Joe\\" was 15 years old. None of the high ranking clergy who \\"Joe\\" spoke to recall being told about the abuse, which \\"Joe\\" considers incredible.[120] A representative of the solicitors firm representing \\"Joe\\" said:\\r\\nThe Church of England wants to bury and discourage allegations of non-recent abuse. They know how difficult it is for survivors to come forward, and it appears from this case that the Church has a plan of making it hard for these vulnerable people to come forward. This survivor has had the courage to press his case. Most do not. Most harbour the psychological fallout in silence. We need to find a way to make the system more approachable for survivors.[121]\\r\\nAlthough an established church, the Church of England does not receive any direct government support. Donations comprise its largest source of income, and it also relies heavily on the income from its various historic endowments. In 2005, the Church of England had estimated total outgoings of around S900?million.[122]\\r\\nThe Church of England manages an investment portfolio which is worth more than S8000?million.[123]\\r\\nThe Church of England supports A Church Near You, an online directory of churches. A user-edited resource, it currently lists 16,400 churches and has 7,000 editors in 42 dioceses.[124] The directory enables parishes to maintain accurate location, contact and event information which is shared with other websites and mobile apps. In 2012, the directory formed the data backbone of Christmas Near You[125] and in 2014 was used to promote the church's Harvest Near You initiative.[126]","input":"What is the name of the first anglican church?"},{"output":"Darwin","context":"A facial expression is one or more motions or positions of the muscles beneath the skin of the face. According to one set of controversial[citation needed] theories, these movements convey the emotional state of an individual to observers. Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. They are a primary means of conveying social information between humans, but they also occur in most other mammals and some other animal species. (For a discussion of the controversies on these claims, see Fridlund[1] and Russell & Fernandez Dols.[2]). The pioneer F-M Facial Action Coding System 2.0 (F-M FACS 2.0) [3] was created in 2017 by Dr. Freitas-Magalh?es, and presents about 2,000 segments in 4K, using 3D technology and automatic and real-time recognition.\\r\\nHumans can adopt a facial expression voluntarily or involuntarily, and the neural mechanisms responsible for controlling the expression differ in each case. Voluntary facial expressions are often socially conditioned and follow a cortical route in the brain. Conversely, involuntary facial expressions are believed to be innate and follow a subcortical route in the brain.\\r\\nFacial recognition is often an emotional experience for the brain and the amygdala is highly involved in the recognition process.\\r\\nThe eyes are often viewed as important features of facial expressions. Aspects such as blinking rate can be used to indicate whether a person is nervous or whether he or she is lying. Also, eye contact is considered an important aspect of interpersonal communication. However, there are cultural differences regarding the social propriety of maintaining eye contact or not.\\r\\nBeyond the accessory nature of facial expressions in spoken communication between people, they play a significant role in communication with sign language. Many phrases in sign language include facial expressions in the display.\\r\\nThere is controversy surrounding the question of whether facial expressions are worldwide and universal displays among humans. Supporters of the Universality Hypothesis claim that many facial expressions are innate and have roots in evolutionary ancestors. Opponents of this view question the accuracy of the studies used to test this claim and instead believe that facial expressions are conditioned and that people view and understand facial expressions in large part from the social situations around them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFacial expressions are vital to social communication between humans. They are caused by the movement of muscles that connect to the skin and fascia in the face. These muscles move the skin, creating lines and folds and causing the movement of facial features, such as the mouth and eyebrows. These muscles develop from the second pharyngeal arch in the embryo. The temporalis, masseter, and internal and external pterygoid muscles, which are mainly used for chewing, have a minor effect on expression as well. These muscles develop from the first pharyngeal arch.[4]\\r\\nThere are two brain pathways associated with facial expression; the first is voluntary expression. Voluntary expression travels from the primary motor cortex through the pyramidal tract, specifically the corticobulbar projections. The cortex is associated with display rules in emotion, which are social precepts that influence and modify expressions. Cortically related expressions are made consciously.[4]\\r\\nThe second type of expression is emotional. These expressions originate from the extrapyramidal motor system, which involves subcortical nuclei. For this reason, genuine emotions are not associated with the cortex and are often displayed unconsciously. This is demonstrated in infants before the age of two; they display distress, disgust, interest, anger, contempt, surprise, and fear. Infants displays of these emotions indicate that they are not cortically related. Similarly, blind children also display emotions, proving that they are subconscious rather than learned. Other subcortical facial expressions include the knit brow during concentration, raised eyebrows when listening attentively, and short punctuation expressions to add emphasis during speech. People can be unaware that they are producing these expressions.[4]\\r\\nThe amygdala plays an important role in facial recognition. Functional imaging studies have found that when shown pictures of faces, there is a large increase in the activity of the amygdala. The amygdala receives visual information from the thalamus via the subcortical pathways.[5] The amygdala may also have a significant role in the recognition of fear and negative emotions. It is believed that the emotion disgust is recognized through activation of the insula and basal ganglia. The recognition of emotion may also utilize the occipitotemporal neocortex, orbitofrontal cortex and right frontoparietal cortices.[6]\\r\\nMore than anything though, what shapes a child's cognitive ability to detect facial expression is being exposed to it from the time of birth. The more an infant is exposed to different faces and expressions, the more able they are to recognize these emotions and then mimic them for themselves. Infants are exposed to an array of emotional expressions from birth, and evidence indicates that they imitate some facial expressions and gestures (e.g., tongue protrusion) as early as the first few days of life.[7][full citation needed] In addition, gender affects the tendency to express, perceive, remember, and forget specific emotions.[8][9] For instance, angry male faces and happy female faces are more recognizable, compared to happy male faces and angry female faces.[9]\\r\\nA person's face, especially their eyes, creates the most obvious and immediate cues that lead to the formation of impressions.[10] This article discusses eyes and facial expressions and the effect they have on interpersonal communication.\\r\\nA person's eyes reveal much about how they are feeling, or what they are thinking. Blink rate can reveal how nervous or at ease a person may be. Research by Boston College professor Joe Tecce suggests that stress levels are revealed by blink rates. He supports his data with statistics on the relation between the blink rates of presidential candidates and their success in their races. Tecce claims that the faster blinker in the presidential debates has lost every election since 1980.[11] Though Tecce's data is interesting, it is important to recognize that non-verbal communication is multi-channeled, and focusing on only one aspect is reckless. Nervousness can also be measured by examining each candidates' perspiration, eye contact and stiffness.[12]\\r\\nWithin their first year, Infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others conveys significant information. Infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze.[13]\\r\\nEye contact is another major aspect of facial communication. Some have hypothesized that this is due to infancy, as humans are one of the few mammals who maintain regular eye contact with their mother while nursing.[14] Eye contact serves a variety of purposes. It regulates conversations, shows interest or involvement, and establishes a connection with others.\\r\\nBut different cultures have different rules for eye contact. Certain Asian cultures can perceive direct eye contact as a way to signal competitiveness, which in many situations may prove to be inappropriate. Others lower their eyes to signal respect, and similarly eye contact is avoided in Nigeria;[15] however, in western cultures this could be misinterpreted as lacking self-confidence.\\r\\nEven beyond the idea of eye contact, eyes communicate more data than a person even consciously expresses. Pupil dilation is a significant cue to a level of excitement, pleasure, or attraction. Dilated pupils indicate greater affection or attraction, while constricted pupils send a colder signal.\\r\\nFacial expression is used in sign languages to convey specific meanings. In American Sign Language (ASL), for instance, raised eyebrows combined with a slightly forward head tilt indicate that what is being signed is a yes/no question. Lowered eyebrows are used for wh-word questions. Facial expression is also used in sign languages to show adverbs and adjectives such as distance or size: an open mouth, squinted eyes, and tilted back head indicate something far while the mouth pulled to one side and the cheek held toward the shoulder indicate something close, and puffed cheeks mean very large. It can also show the manner in which something is done, such as carelessly or routinely.[16] Some of these expressions, also called non-manual signs, are used similarly in different sign languages while others are different from one language to another. For example, the expression used for 'carelessly' in ASL means 'boring or unpleasant' in British Sign Language.[17]\\r\\nThe universality hypothesis is the assumption that certain facial expressions and face-related acts/ events are signals of specific emotions (happiness with laughter and smiling, sadness with tears, anger with a clenched jaw, fear with a grimace, surprise with raised eyebrows and wide eyes along with a slight retraction of the ears, and disgust with a wrinkled nose and squinted eyes emotions which frequently lack the social component of those like shame, pride, jealousy, envy, deferance, etc.) and are recognized by people regardless of culture, language, or time. The belief in the evolutionary basis of these kinds of facial expressions can be traced back to Darwins The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Reviews of the universality hypothesis have been both supportive[18][19] and critical.[20][21] Work in 2013 by Nelson and Russell[22] and Jack et al.[23] has been especially critical.\\r\\nEkman's work on facial expressions had its starting point in the work of psychologist Silvan Tomkins. Ekman showed that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal across human cultures.\\r\\nTo demonstrate his universality hypothesis, Ekman ran a test on a group of the South Fore people of New Guinea, a pre-industrial culture that was isolated from the West. The experiment participants were told brief stories about emotional events (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust). After each story, they were asked to select the matching facial expression from an array of three faces.[24] The Fore selected the correct face on 64%-90% of trials but had difficulty distinguishing the fear face from the surprise face. Children selected from an array of only two faces, and their results were similar to the adults. Subsequent cross-cultural studies found similar results.[25]\\r\\nBoth sides of this debate agree that the face expresses emotion. The controversy surrounds the uncertainty about what specific emotional information is read from a facial expression. Opponents of the universality hypothesis believe that more general information is pieced together with other contextual information in order to determine how a person feels.[26]\\r\\nOne argument against the evidence presented in support of the universality hypothesis is that the method typically used to demonstrate universality inflates recognition scores.[21] Although each factor may contribute only a small amount to the inflation, combined, they can produce exaggerated scores. The three main factors are the following:\\r\\nDarwin argued that the expression of emotions has evolved in humans from animal ancestors, who would have used similar methods of expression. Darwin believed that expressions were unlearned and innate in human nature and were therefore evolutionarily significant for survival. He compiled supporting evidence from his research on different cultures, on infants, and in other animal species.[31] Ekman found that people from different cultures recognized certain facial expressions despite vast cultural differences, and his findings tended to confirm Darwins initial hypothesis.[32]\\r\\nCross-cultural studies had shown that there are similarities in the way emotions are expressed across diverse cultures, but studies have even shown that there are similarities between species in how emotions are expressed. Research has shown that chimpanzees are able to communicate many of the same facial expressions as humans through the complex movements of the facial muscles. In fact, the facial cues were so similar that Ekmans Facial Action Coding System could be applied to the chimps in evaluating their expressions.[33] Of course, differences between the species' physical facial properties, such as white sclera and everted lips in chimps, would mean that some expressions could not be compared.[34]\\r\\nSimilarly, Darwin observed that infants method of expression for certain emotions was instinctive, as they were able to display emotional expressions they had not themselves yet witnessed.[35] Facial morphology impacts expression recognition in important ways, and therefore, infant facial morphology may also serve some specific communicative function. These similarities in morphology and movement are important for the correct interpretation of an emotion.[36] Darwin was particularly interested in the functions of facial expression as evolutionarily important for survival. He looked at the functions of facial expression in terms of the utility of expression in the life of the animal and in terms of specific expressions within species. Darwin deduced that some animals communicated feelings of different emotional states with specific facial expressions. He further concluded that this communication was important for the survival of animals in group-dwelling species; the skill to effectively communicate or interpret another animals feelings and behaviors would be a principal trait in naturally fit species.[37] However, this suggests that solitary species such as orang-utans would not exhibit such expressions.","input":"Who was the first researcher to suggest that facial expressions are pre-verbal?"},{"output":"The crust","context":"The interior structure of the Earth is layered in spherical shells. These layers can be defined by their chemical and their rheological properties. Earth has an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core. Scientific understanding of the internal structure of the Earth is based on observations of topography and bathymetry, observations of rock in outcrop, samples brought to the surface from greater depths by volcanoes or volcanic activity, analysis of the seismic waves that pass through the Earth, measurements of the gravitational and magnetic fields of the Earth, and experiments with crystalline solids at pressures and temperatures characteristic of the Earth's deep interior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe force exerted by Earth's gravity can be used to calculate its mass. Astronomers can also calculate Earth's mass by observing the motion of orbiting satellites. Earths average density can be determined through gravitometric experiments, which have historically involved pendulums.\\r\\nThe mass of Earth is about 7024600000000000000?6G1024?kg.[1]\\r\\nThe structure of Earth can be defined in two ways: by mechanical properties such as rheology, or chemically. Mechanically, it can be divided into lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesospheric mantle, outer core, and the inner core. Chemically, Earth can be divided into the crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core. The geologic component layers of Earth[3][not in citation given] are at the following depths below the surface:\\r\\nThe layering of Earth has been inferred indirectly using the time of travel of refracted and reflected seismic waves created by earthquakes. The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel (seismic velocity) is different in other layers. The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to Snell's law, like light bending as it passes through a prism. Likewise, reflections are caused by a large increase in seismic velocity and are similar to light reflecting from a mirror.\\r\\nThe crust ranges from 5ÿ70 kilometres (3.1ÿ43.5?mi) in depth and is the outermost layer. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5ÿ10?km) and are composed of dense (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like granite. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories ÿ sial and sima (Suess,1831ÿ1914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11?km below the Conrad discontinuity (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity, which is most commonly known as the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites, which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences.\\r\\nMany rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1G108) years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are 4.4 billion (4.4G109) years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least that long.[4]\\r\\nEarth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890?km, making it the thickest layer of Earth. The mantle is divided into upper and lower mantle. The upper and lower mantle are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the mantle next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D (pronounced dee-double-prime[5]) layer. The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is 140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid, the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the lower part of the mantle flows less easily than does the upper mantle (chemical changes within the mantle may also be important). The viscosity of the mantle ranges between 1021 and 1024 Pa{s, depending on depth.[6] In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10?3 Pa{s and that of pitch is 107 Pa{s. The source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat left over from the planets formation as well as the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earths crust and mantle.[7]\\r\\nThe average density of Earth is 5,515?kg/m3. Because the average density of surface material is only around 3,000?kg/m3, we must conclude that denser materials exist within Earth's core. Seismic measurements show that the core is divided into two parts, a \\"solid\\" inner core with a radius of 1,220?km[8] and a liquid outer core extending beyond it to a radius of 3,400?km. The densities are between 9,900 and 12,200?kg/m3 in the outer core and 12,600ÿ13,000?kg/m3 in the inner core.[9]\\r\\nThe inner core was discovered in 1936 by Inge Lehmann and is generally believed to be composed primarily of iron and some nickel. It is not necessarily a solid, but, because it is able to deflect seismic waves, it must behave as a solid in some fashion. Experimental evidence has at times been critical of crystal models of the core.[10] Other experimental studies show a discrepancy under high pressure: diamond anvil (static) studies at core pressures yield melting temperatures that are approximately 2000?K below those from shock laser (dynamic) studies.[11][12] The laser studies create plasma,[13] and the results are suggestive that constraining inner core conditions will depend on whether the inner core is a solid or is a plasma with the density of a solid. This is an area of active research.\\r\\nIn early stages of Earth's formation about four and a half billion (4.5G109) years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called planetary differentiation (see also the iron catastrophe), while less-dense materials would have migrated to the crust. The core is thus believed to largely be composed of iron (80%), along with nickel and one or more light elements, whereas other dense elements, such as lead and uranium, either are too rare to be significant or tend to bind to lighter elements and thus remain in the crust (see felsic materials). Some have argued that the inner core may be in the form of a single iron crystal.[14][15]\\r\\nUnder laboratory conditions a sample of ironÿnickel alloy was subjected to the corelike pressures by gripping it in a vise between 2 diamond tips (diamond anvil cell), and then heating to approximately 4000 K. The sample was observed with x-rays, and strongly supported the theory that Earth's inner core was made of giant crystals running north to south.[16][17]\\r\\nThe liquid outer core surrounds the inner core and is believed to be composed of iron mixed with nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements.\\r\\nRecent speculation suggests that the innermost part of the core is enriched in gold, platinum and other siderophile elements.[18]\\r\\nThe matter that comprises Earth is connected in fundamental ways to matter of certain chondrite meteorites, and to matter of outer portion of the Sun.[19][20] There is good reason to believe that Earth is, in the main, like a chondrite meteorite. Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including Francis Birch, built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called enstatite chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\\r\\nDynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the Coriolis effect, gives rise to Earth's magnetic field. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see Curie temperature) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core. The average magnetic field strength in Earth's outer core is estimated to be 25 Gauss (2.5?mT), 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.[21][22]\\r\\nRecent evidence has suggested that the inner core of Earth may rotate slightly faster than the rest of the planet;[23] however, more recent studies in 2011[which?] found this hypothesis to be inconclusive. Options remain for the core which may be oscillatory in nature or a chaotic system.[citation needed] In August 2005 a team of geophysicists announced in the journal Science that, according to their estimates, Earth's inner core rotates approximately 0.3 to 0.5?degrees per year faster relative to the rotation of the surface.[24][25]\\r\\nThe current scientific explanation for Earth's temperature gradient is a combination of heat left over from the planet's initial formation, decay of radioactive elements, and freezing of the inner core.\\r\\n Media related to Structure of the Earth at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the solid outer layer of the earth called?"},{"output":"October 1, 1949","context":"The history of the People's Republic of China details the history of mainland China since October 1, 1949, when, after a near complete victory by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Chinese Civil War, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC) from atop Tiananmen. The PRC has for several decades been synonymous with China, but it is only the most recent political entity to govern mainland China, preceded by the Republic of China (ROC) and thousands of years of imperial dynasties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Chinese Civil War and the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist forces over the Kuomintang forces of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan, Mao declared the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Mao's first goal was a total overhaul of the land ownership system, and extensive land reforms. China's old system of landlord ownership of farmland and tenant peasants was replaced with a distribution system in favor of poor/landless peasants which significantly reduced economic inequality. In Zhangzhuangcun, in the more thoroughly reformed north of the country, most \\"landlords\\" and \\"rich peasants\\" had lost all their land and often their lives or had fled. All formerly landless workers had received land, which eliminated this category altogether. As a result, \\"middling peasants,\\" who now accounted for 90 percent of the village population, owned 90.8 percent of the land, as close to perfect equality as one could possibly hope for.[1] Mao laid heavy theoretical emphasis on class struggle, and in 1953 began various campaigns to persecute former landlords and merchants, including the execution of more powerful landlords. Drug trafficking in the country as well as foreign investment were largely wiped out.\\r\\nMao believed that socialism would eventually triumph over all other ideologies, and following the First Five-Year Plan based on a Soviet-style centrally controlled economy, Mao took on the ambitious project of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, beginning an unprecedented process of collectivization in rural areas. Mao urged the use of communally organized iron smelters to increase steel production, pulling workers off of agricultural labor to the point that large amounts of crops rotted unharvested. Mao decided to continue to advocate these smelters despite a visit to a factory steel mill which proved to him that high quality steel could only be produced in a factory. He thought that ending the program would dampen peasant enthusiasm for his political mobilization, the Great Leap Forward.\\r\\nScholars outside of China also credit Mao for boosting literacy (only 20% of the population could read in 1949, compared to 65.5% thirty years later), doubling life expectancy, a near doubling of the population, and developing China's industry and infrastructure, paving the way for its position as a world power.[2]\\r\\nThe implementation of Maoist thought in China may have been responsible for over 35 million excessive deaths during peacetime,[citation needed] with the Great Leap Forward, Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957-58,[3] and the Cultural Revolution. Millions died from both executions and forced labour. Because of Mao's land reforms during the Great Leap Forward, which resulted in massive famines, thirty million perished between 1958 and 1961. By the end of 1961 the birth rate was nearly cut in half because of malnutrition.[4] Active campaigns, including party purges and \\"reeducation\\" resulted in the imprisonment or execution of those deemed to hold views contrary to Maoist ideals.[5] Mao's failure with the Leap reduced his power in government, whose administrative duties fell to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping.\\r\\nTo impose socialist orthodoxy and rid China of \\"old elements\\", and at the same time serving certain political goals, Mao began the Cultural Revolution in May 1966. The campaign was far reaching into all aspects of Chinese life. Red Guards terrorized the streets as many ordinary citizens were deemed counter-revolutionaries. Education and public transportation came to a nearly complete halt. Daily life involved shouting slogans and reciting Mao quotations. Many prominent political leaders, including Liu and Deng, were purged and deemed \\"capitalist-roaders\\". The campaign would not come to a complete end until the death of Mao in 1976.\\r\\nSupporters of the Maoist Era claim that under Mao, China's unity and sovereignty was assured for the first time in a century, and there was development of infrastructure, industry, healthcare, and education, which raised standard of living for the average Chinese. They also claimed that campaigns such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were essential in jumpstarting China's development and \\"purifying\\" its culture. Others[who?] claim that though the consequences of both these campaigns were economically and humanly disastrous, they left behind a \\"clean slate\\" on which later economic progress could be built. Supporters often also doubt statistics or accounts given for death tolls or other damages incurred by Mao's campaigns, attributing the high death toll to natural disasters, famine, or other consequences of political chaos during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek.\\r\\nCritics of Mao's regime assert that Mao's administration imposed strict controls over everyday life, and believe that political campaigns such as the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution and many others during Mao's era (1949ÿ1976) contributed to or caused millions of deaths, incurred severe economic costs, and damaged China's cultural heritage. The Great Leap Forward in particular preceded a massive famine in which[6] 30ÿ40 million people died; most Western and many Chinese analysts attribute this to poor agricultural and economic planning.\\r\\nMao Zedong's death was followed by a power struggle between the Gang of Four, Hua Guofeng, and eventually Deng Xiaoping. Deng would maneuver himself to the top of China's leadership by 1980. At the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, Deng embarked China on the road to Economic Reforms and Openness (T˜ Gaige Kaifang), policies that began with the de-collectivization of the countryside, followed with industrial reforms aimed at decentralizing government controls in the industrial sector. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum, gave a \\"preliminary assessment\\" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution \\"an appalling catastrophe\\" and \\"the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949].\\"[7] The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that \\"Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the \\"cultural revolution\\", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.\\"[8]\\r\\nOn the subject of Mao's legacy Deng coined the famous phrase \\"7 parts good, 3 parts bad\\" and avoided denouncing Mao altogether. Deng championed the idea of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), areas where foreign investment would be allowed to pour in without strict government restraint and regulations, running on a basically capitalist system. Deng laid emphasis on light industry as a stepping stone to the development of heavy industries.\\r\\nSupporters of the economic reforms point to the rapid development of the consumer and export sectors of the economy, the creation of an urban middle class that now constitutes 15% of the population, higher living standards (which is shown via dramatic increases in GDP per capita, consumer spending, life expectancy, literacy rate, and total grain output) and a much wider range of personal rights and freedoms for average Chinese as evidence of the success of the reforms.\\r\\nAlthough standards of living improved significantly in the 1980s, Deng's reforms were not without criticism. Hard-liners asserted that Deng opened China once again to various social evils, and an overall increase in materialistic thinking, while liberals attacked Deng's unrelenting stance on political reform. Liberal forces began gathering in different forms to protest against the Party's authoritarian leadership. In 1989, the death of Hu Yaobang, a liberal figure, triggered weeks of spontaneous protests in the Tiananmen Square. The government imposed martial law and sent in tanks and soldiers to suppress the demonstrations. Western countries and multilateral organizations briefly suspended their formal ties with China's government under Premier Li Peng's leadership, which was directly responsible for the military curfew and bloody crackdown.\\r\\nCritics of the economic reforms, both in China and abroad, claim that the reforms have caused wealth disparity, environmental pollution, rampant corruption, widespread unemployment associated with layoffs at inefficient state-owned enterprises, and has introduced often unwelcome cultural influences. Consequently, they believe that China's culture has been corrupted, the poor have been reduced to a hopeless abject underclass, and that the social stability is threatened. They are also of the opinion that various political reforms, such as moves towards popular elections, have been unfairly nipped in the bud. Regardless of either view, today, the public perception of Mao has improved at least superficially; images of Mao and Mao related objects have become fashionable, commonly used on novelty items and even as talismans. However, the path of modernization and market-oriented economic reforms that China started since the early 1980s appears to be fundamentally unchallenged. Even critics of China's market reforms do not wish to see a backtrack of these two decades of reforms, but rather propose corrective measures to offset some of the social issues caused by existing reforms.\\r\\nIn 1979, the Chinese government instituted a one child policy to try to control its rapidly increasing population. The controversial policy resulted in a dramatic decrease in child poverty. The law currently applies to about a third of mainland Chinese, with plans in place to ease it to a two-child limit.[9][10]\\r\\nThe achievements of Lee Kuan Yew to create an economic superpower in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China. They made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.[11]\\r\\nAfter the events at Tiananmen, Deng Xiaoping retired from public view. While keeping ultimate control, power was passed onto the third generation of leadership led by Jiang Zemin, who was hailed as its \\"core\\". Economic growth, despite foreign trade embargoes, returned to a fast pace by the mid-1990s. Jiang's macroeconomic reforms furthered Deng's vision for \\"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\\". At the same time, Jiang's period saw a continued rise in social corruption in all areas of life. Unemployment skyrocketed as unprofitable SOE's were closed to make way for more competitive ventures, internally and abroad. The ill-equipped social welfare system was put on a serious test. Jiang also laid heavy emphasis on scientific and technological advancement in areas such as space exploration. To sustain vast human consumption, the Three Gorges Dam was built, attracting supporters and widespread criticism. Environmental pollution became a very serious problem as Beijing was frequently hit by sandstorms as a result of desertification.\\r\\nThe 1990s saw two foreign colonies returned to China, Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, and Macau from Portugal in 1999. Hong Kong and Macau mostly continued their own governance, retaining independence in their economic, social, and judicial systems.\\r\\nJiang and President Clinton exchanged state visits, but Sino-American relations took very sour turns at the end of the decade. On May 7, 1999, during the Kosovo War, US aircraft bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The U.S. government claimed the strike was due to bad intelligence and false target identification.\\r\\nInside the US, the Cox Report stated that China had been stealing various top US military secrets.\\r\\nIn 2001, a US surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet over international waters near Hainan, inciting further outrage with the Chinese public, already dissatisfied with the US.\\r\\nOn the political agenda, China was once again put on the spotlight for the banning of public Falun Gong activity in 1999. Silent protesters from the spiritual movement sat outside of Zhongnanhai, asking for dialogue with China's leaders. Jiang saw it as threatening to the political situation and outlawed the group altogether, while using the mass media to denounce it as an evil cult.\\r\\nConversely, Premier Zhu Rongji's economic policies held China's economy strong during the Asian Financial Crisis. Economic growth averaged at 8% annually, pushed back by the 1998 Yangtze River Floods. After a decade of talks, China was finally admitted into the World Trade Organization. Standards of living improved significantly, although a wide urban-rural wealth gap was opened, as China saw the reappearance of the middle class. Wealth disparity between East and the Western hinterlands continued to widen by the day, prompting government programs to \\"develop the West\\", taking on such ambitious projects such as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The burden of education was greater than ever. Rampant corruption continued despite Premier Zhu's anti-corruption campaign that executed many officials.\\r\\nThe first major crisis faced by China in the 21st century as a new generation of leaders led by Hu Jintao after assuming power was the public health crisis involving SARS, an illness that seemed to have originated out of Guangdong province. China's position in the war on terror drew the country closer diplomatically to the United States. The economy continues to grow in double-digit numbers as the development of rural areas became the major focus of government policy. In gradual steps to consolidate his power, Hu Jintao removed Shanghai Party Chief Chen Liangyu and other potential political opponents amidst the fight against corruption, and the ongoing struggle against once powerful Shanghai clique. The assertion of the Scientific Perspective to create a Socialist Harmonious Society is the focus of the Hu-Wen administration, as some Jiang-era excesses are slowly reversed. In the years after Hu's rise to power, respect of basic human rights in China continue to be a source of concern.\\r\\nThe political status and future of Taiwan remain uncertain, but steps have been taken to improving relations between the Communist Party and several of Taiwan's parties that hold a less antagonistic view towards China, notably former rival Kuomintang.\\r\\nThe continued economic growth of the country as well as its sporting power status gained China the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. However, this also put Hu's administration under intense spotlight. While the 2008 Olympic was commonly understood to be a come-out party for People's Republic of China, in light of the March 2008 Tibet protests, the government received heavy scrutiny. The Olympic torch was met with protest en route. Within the country these reactions were met with a fervent wave of nationalism with accusations of Western bias against China.\\r\\nIn May 2008, a massive earthquake registering 8.0 on the Richter scale hit Sichuan province of China, exacting a death toll officially estimated at approximately 70,000. The government responded more quickly than it did with previous events, and has allowed foreign media access to the regions that were hit the hardest. The adequacy of the government response was generally praised, and the relief efforts extended to every corner of Chinese life. In May and June 2008, heavy rains in southern China caused severe flooding in the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong, with dozens of fatalities and over a million people forced to evacuate. As of 2009 China has increased its internet monitoring capabilities by adding hundreds of new monitoring stations.","input":"When was the peoples republic of china founded?"},{"output":"Pacific","context":"The olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), also known as the Pacific ridley sea turtle, is a medium-sized species of sea turtle found in warm and tropical waters, primarily in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They can also be found in warm waters of Atlantic ocean. [3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing to about 2 feet in length, the Olive ridley gets its name from its olive colored carapace, which is heart-shaped and rounded. Males and females grow to the same size; however, females have a slightly more rounded carapace as compared to the male.[4] The heart-shaped carapace is characterized by four pairs of pore-bearing inframarginal scutes on the bridge, two pairs of prefrontals, and up to 9 lateral scutes per side. Olive ridleys are unique in that they can have variable and asymmetrical lateral scute 6 to 8 counts ranging from five to 9 plates on each side, with six to eight being most commonly observed.[5] Each side of the carapace has 12ÿ14 marginal scutes.\\r\\nThe carapace is flattened dorsally and highest anterior to the bridge. It has a mediumÿsized, broad head that appears triangular from above. The head's concave sides are most obvious on the upper part of the short snout. It has paddle-like forelimbs, each having two anterior claws. The upperparts are grayish green to olive in color, but sometimes appear reddish due to algae growing on the carapace. The bridge and hingeless plastron of an adult varies from greenish white in younger individuals to a creamy yellow in older specimens (maximum age being up to 50 years).[5][6]\\r\\nHatchlings are dark gray with a pale yolk scar, but appear all black when wet.[5] Carapace length ranges from 37 to 50?mm. A thin, white line borders the carapace, as well as the trailing edge of the fore and hind flippers.[6] Both hatchlings and juveniles have serrated posterior marginal scutes, which become smooth with age. Juveniles also have three dorsal keels; the central longitudinal keel gives younger turtles a serrated profile, which remains until sexual maturity is reached.[5]\\r\\nOlive ridleys rarely weigh over 50?kg (110?lb). A study in Oaxaca, Mexico, reported a sample of adults ranged from 25 to 46?kg; adult females weighed an average of 35.45?kg (n=58), while adult males weighed significantly less, averaging 33.00?kg (n=17). Hatchlings usually weigh between 12.0 and 23.3?g.\\r\\nAdults are somewhat sexually dimorphic. Mature males have longer and thicker tails, which are used for copulation,[5] and the presence of enlarged and hooked claws on the males' front flippers allow them to grasp the female carapace during copulation. Males also have longer, more tapered carapaces than females, which have round, dome-like carapaces.[5] Males also have more concave plastrons, believed to be another adaptation for mating. The plastrons of males may also be softer than females.[6]\\r\\nThe olive ridley turtle has a circumtropical distribution, living in tropical and warm waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans from India, Arabia, Japan, and Micronesia south to southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In the Atlantic Ocean, it has been observed off the western coast of Africa and the coasts of northern Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Venezuela. Additionally, the olive ridley has been recorded in the Caribbean Sea as far north as Puerto Rico. A female individual was found alive on an Irish Sea beach on the Isle of Anglesey, British Isles in November 2016, giving this species its northernmost appearance. It was taken in by the nearby Anglesey Sea Zoo while its health was being assessed.[7] The olive ridley is also found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Galapagos Islands and Chile north to the Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast to at least Oregon Migratory movements have been studied less intensely in olive ridleys than other species of marine turtles, but they are believed to use the coastal waters of over 80 countries.[8] Historically, this species has been widely regarded as the most abundant sea turtle in the world.[5] More than one million olive ridleys were commercially harvested off the coasts of Mexico in 1968 alone.[9]\\r\\nThe population of Pacific Mexico was estimated to be at least 10 million prior to the era of mass exploitation. More recently, the global population of annual nesting females has been reduced to about two million by 2004,[10] and was further reduced to 852,550 by 2008.[1][11] This indicated a dramatic decrease of 28 to 32% in the global population within only one generation (i.e., 20 years).[8]\\r\\nThe olive ridley sea turtles are considered the most abundant, yet globally they have declined by more than 30% from historic levels.[citation needed] These turtles are considered endangered because of their few remaining nesting sites in the world. The eastern Pacific turtles have been found to range from Baja California, Mexico, to Chile. Pacific olive ridleys nest around Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua, and the northern Indian Ocean; the breeding colony in Mexico was listed as endangered in the US on July 28, 1978.[12]\\r\\nOlive ridley turtles are best known for their behavior of synchronized nesting in mass numbers, termed arribadas.[6] Interestingly, females return to the very same beach from where they first hatched, to lay their eggs. They lay their eggs in conical nests about one and a half feet deep which they laboriously dig with their hind flippers. [4] In the Indian Ocean, the majority of olive ridleys nest in two or three large groups near Gahirmatha in Odisha. The coast of Odisha in India is the largest mass nesting site for the olive ridley, followed by the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica.[4] In 1991, over 600,000 turtles nested along the coast of Odisha in one week. Nesting occurs elsewhere along the Coromandel Coast and Sri Lanka, but in scattered locations. However, olive ridleys are considered a rarity in most areas of the Indian Ocean.[11]\\r\\nThey are also rare in the western and central Pacific, with known arribadas occurring only within the tropical eastern Pacific, in Central America and Mexico. In Costa Rica, they occur at Nancite and Ostional beaches. Two active arribadas are in Nicaragua, Chacocente and La Flor, with a small nesting ground in Pacific Panama. Historically, several arribadas were in Mexico, yet only one remains at Playa Escobilla in Oaxaca.[11]\\r\\nAlthough olive ridleys are famed for their arribadas, many of the nesting grounds can only support relatively small to moderate-sized aggregations (about 1,000 nesting females). The overall contribution and importance of these nesting beaches to the population may be underestimated by the scientific community.[5]\\r\\nSome of the olive ridley's foraging grounds near southern California are contaminated due to sewage, agricultural runoff, pesticides, solvents, and industrial discharges. These contaminants have been shown to decline the productivity of the benthic community, which negatively affects these turtles, which feed from these communities.[5] The increasing demand to build marinas and docks near Baja California and southern California are also negatively affecting the olive ridleys in these areas, where an increase in oil and gas will be released into these sensitive habitats. Another threat to these turtles are power plants, which have documented juvenile and subadult turtles becoming entrained and entrapped within the saltwater cooling intake systems.[5]\\r\\nThe olive ridley was first described as Testudo mydas minor, Suckhow, 1798. It was later renamed Chelonian olivacea, Eschscholtz, 1829, and eventually Lepidochelys olivacea Fitzinger, 1843.[13] Because Eschscholtz was the first to propose the specific epithet olivacea, though, he was credited with the valid name Lepidochelys olivacea Eschscholtz, 1829.\\r\\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek words lepidos, meaning scale, and chelys, which translates to turtle. This could possibly be a reference to the supernumerary costal scute counts characteristic of this genus.[5] The etymology of the English vernacular name \\"olive\\" is somewhat easier to resolve, as its carapace is olive green in color.[14] However, the origin of \\"ridley\\" is still somewhat unclear, perhaps derived from \\"riddle\\".[15] Lepidochelys is the only genus of sea turtles containing more than one extant species: L. olivacea and the closely related L. kempii (Kemp's ridley).[16]\\r\\nMating is often assumed to occur in the vicinity of nesting beaches, but copulating pairs have been reported over 1,000?km from the nearest beach. Research from Costa Rica revealed the number of copulating pairs observed near the beach could not be responsible for the fertilization of the tens of thousands of gravid females, so a significant amount of mating is believed to have occurred elsewhere at other times of the year.[5]\\r\\nThe Gahirmatha Beach in Kendrapara district of Odisha (India), which is now a part of the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, is the largest breeding ground for these turtles. The Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, which bounds the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary to the east, was created in September 1997, and encompasses Gahirmatha Beach and an adjacent portion of the Bay of Bengal. Bhitarkanika Mangroves were designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2002. It is the world's largest known rookery of olive ridley sea turtles. Apart from Gahirmatha rookery, two other mass nesting beaches have been located which are on the mouth of rivers Rushikulya and Devi. The spectacular site of mass congregation of olive ridley sea turtles for mating and nesting enthralls both the scientists and the nature lovers throughout the world.\\r\\nOlive ridley sea turtles migrate in huge numbers from the beginning of November, every year, for mating and nesting along the coast of Orissa. Gahirmatha coast has the annual nesting figure between one hundred to five hundred thousand, each year. There has been decline in the population of these turtles in the recent past due to mass mortality. The olive ridley sea turtle has been listed on Schedule - I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (amended 1991). All the species of sea turtles in the coastal water of Orissa are listed as \\"vulnerable\\" in the IUCN Red Data Book.[4] The sea turtles are protected under the 'Migratory Species Convention' and CITES (Convention of International Trade on Wildlife Flora and Fauna). India is a signatory nation to all these conventions. The 'Homing' characteristics of the Ridley sea turtles make them more prone to mass casualty. The voyage to the natal nesting beaches is the dooming factor for the sea turtles. Since Gahirmatha coast serves as the natal nesting beach for millions of turtles, it has immense importance on turtle conservation.[17]\\r\\nOlive ridleys generally begin to aggregate near nesting beaches about two months before nesting season, although this may vary throughout its range. In the eastern Pacific, nesting occurs throughout the year, with peak nesting events (arribadas) occurring between September and December. Nesting beaches can be characterized as relatively flat, midbeach zone, and free of debris.[13] Beach fidelity is common, but not absolute. Nesting events are usually nocturnal, but diurnal nesting has been reported, especially during large arribadas.[5] Exact age of sexual maturity is unknown, but this can be somewhat inferred from data on minimum breeding size. For example, the average carapace length of nesting females (n = 251) at Playa Nancite, Costa Rica was determined to be 63.3?cm, with the smallest recorded at 54.0?cm.[5] Females can lay up to three clutches per season, but most will only lay one or two clutches.[6] The female will remain near shore for the internesting period, which is about one month. Mean clutch size varies throughout its range and decreases with each nesting attempt.[11]\\r\\nA mean clutch size of 116 (30ÿ168 eggs) was observed in Surinam, while nesting females from the eastern Pacific were found to have an average of 105 (74ÿ126 eggs).[6] The incubation period is usually between 45 and 51 days under natural conditions, but may extend to 70 days in poor weather conditions. Eggs incubated at temperatures of 31 to 32?C will produce only females; eggs incubated at 28?C or less will produce solely males; and incubation temperatures of 29 to 30?C will produce a mixed sex clutch.[6] Hatching success can vary by beach and year, due to changing environmental conditions and rates of nest predation.\\r\\nMost observations are typically within 15?km of mainland shores in protected, relatively shallow marine waters (22ÿ55 m deep).[6] Olive ridleys are occasionally found in open waters. The multiple habitats and geographical localities used by this species vary throughout its life cycle.[13] More research is needed to acquire data on and use of pelagic habitats.[5]\\r\\nThe olive ridley is predominantly carnivorous, especially in immature stages of the life cycle. Animal prey consists of protochordates or invertebrates, which can be caught in shallow marine waters or estuarine habitats. Common prey items include jellyfish, tunicates, sea urchins, bryozoans, bivalves, snails, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and sipunculid worms. Additionally, consumption of jellyfish and both adult fish (e.g. Sphoeroides) and fish eggs may be indicative of pelagic (open ocean) feeding.[6] The olive ridley is also known to feed on filamentous algae in areas devoid of other food sources. Captive studies have indicated some level of cannibalistic behavior in this species.[5]\\r\\nKnown predators of olive ridley eggs include raccoons, coyotes, feral dogs and pigs, opossums, coatimundi, caimans, ghost crabs, and the sunbeam snake.[6] Hatchlings are preyed upon as they travel across the beach to the water by vultures, frigate birds, crabs, raccoons, coyotes, iguanas, and snakes. In the water, hatchling predators most likely include oceanic fishes, sharks, and crocodiles. Adults have relatively few known predators, other than sharks, and killer whales are responsible for occasional attacks. On land, nesting females may be attacked by jaguars. It is notable that the jaguar is the only cat with a strong enough bite to penetrate a sea turtle's shell, thought to be an evolutionary adaption from the Holocene extinction event. In observations of jaguar attacks, it was noted that the cats consumed the neck muscles of the turtle and occasionally the flippers, but left the remainder of the turtle carcass for scavengers as most likely, despite the strength of its jaws, a jaguar still cannot easily penetrate an adult turtle's shell to reach the internal organs or other muscles. In recent years, increased predation on turtles by jaguars has been noted, perhaps due to habitat loss and fewer alternative food sources. Sea turtles are comparatively defenseless in this situation as they cannot pull their head into their shell like freshwater and terrestrial turtles.[5][18] Females are often plagued by mosquitos during nesting. Humans are still listed as the leading threat to L. olivacea, responsible for unsustainable egg collection, slaughtering nesting females on the beach, and direct harvesting adults at sea for commercial sale of both the meat and hides.[6]\\r\\nOther major threats include mortality associated with boat collisions, and incidental takes in fisheries. Trawling, gill nets, ghost nests, longline fishing, and pot fishing, have significantly affected olive ridley populations, as well as other species of marine turtles.[1][5] Between 1993 and 2003, more than 100,000 olive ridley turtles were reported dead in Odisha, India from fishery-related practices.[19] In addition, entanglement and ingestion of marine debris is listed as a major threat for this species. Coastal development, natural disasters, climate change, and other sources of beach erosion have also been cited as potential threats to nesting grounds.[5] Additionally, coastal development also threatens newly hatched turtles through the effects of light pollution.[20] Hatchlings which use light cues to orient themselves to the sea are now misled into moving towards land, and die from dehydration or exhaustion, or are killed on roads.\\r\\nHowever, the greatest single cause of olive ridley egg loss results from arribadas, in which the density of nesting females is so high, previously laid nests are inadvertently dug up and destroyed by other nesting females.[5] In some cases, nests become cross-contaminated by bacteria or pathogens of rotting nests. For example, in Playa Nancite, Costa Rica, only 0.2% of the 11.5 million eggs produced in a single arribada successfully hatched. Although some of this loss resulted from predation and high tides, the majority was attributed to conspecifics unintentionally destroying existing nests. The extent to which arribadas contribute to the population status of olive ridleys has created debate among scientists. Many believe the massive reproductive output of these nesting events is critical to maintaining populations, while others maintain the traditional arribada beaches fall far short of their reproductive potential and are most likely not sustaining population levels.[5] In some areas, this debate eventually led to legalizing egg collection.\\r\\nHistorically, the olive ridley has been exploited for food, bait, oil, leather, and fertilizer. The meat is not considered a delicacy; the egg, however, is esteemed everywhere. Egg collection is illegal in most of the countries where olive ridleys nest, but these laws are rarely enforced. Harvesting eggs has the potential to contribute to local economies, so the unique practice of allowing a sustainable (legal) egg harvest has been attempted in several localities.[11] Numerous case studies have been conducted in regions of arribadas beaches to investigate and understand the socioeconomic, cultural, and political issues of egg collection. Of these, the legal egg harvest at Ostional, Costa Rica, has been viewed by many as both biologically sustainable and economically viable. Since egg collection became legal in 1987, local villagers have been able to harvest and sell around three million eggs annually. They are permitted to collect eggs during the first 36 hours of the nesting period, as many of these eggs would be destroyed by later nesting females. Over 27 million eggs are left unharvested, and villagers have played a large role in protecting these nests from predators, thereby increasing hatching success.[5]\\r\\nMost participating households reported egg harvesting as their most important activity, and profits earned were superior to other forms of available employment, other than tourism. The price of Ostional eggs was intentionally kept low to discourage illegal collection of eggs from other beaches. The Ostional project retained more local profits than similar egg collection projects in Nicaragua,[11] but evaluating egg harvesting projects such as this suffers from the short timeline and site specificity of findings. In most regions, illegal poaching of eggs is considered a major threat to olive ridley populations, thus the practice of allowing legal egg harvests continues to attract criticism from conservationists and sea turtle biologists. Plotkin's Biology and Conservation of Ridley Sea Turtles, particularly the chapter by Lisa Campbell titled \\"Understanding Human Use of Olive Ridleys\\", provides further research on the Ostional harvest (as well as other harvesting projects). Scott Drucker's documentary, Between the Harvest, offers a glimpse into this world and the debate surrounding it.\\r\\nThe olive ridley is classified as Vulnerable according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and is listed in Appendix I of CITES. These listings were largely responsible for halting the large scale commercial exploitation and trade of olive ridley skins.[1] The Convention on Migratory Species and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles have also provided olive ridleys with protection, leading to increased conservation and management for this marine turtle. National listings for this species range from Endangered to Threatened, yet enforcing these sanctions on a global scale has been unsuccessful for the most part. Conservation successes for the olive ridley have relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local communities and nongovernment organizations, which focused primarily on public outreach and education.Arribada management has also played a critical role in conserving olive ridleys.[11] Lastly, enforcing the use of turtle excluder devices in the shrimp trawling industry has also proved effective in some areas.[1] Globally, the olive ridley continues to receive less conservation attention than its close relative, the Kemp's ridley (L. kempii).Also many schools arrange trips for students to carry out the conservation project, especially in India\\r\\nSeveral projects worldwide seek to preserve the olive ridley sea turtle population. For example, in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, when the turtles come to the beach to lay their eggs, some of them are relocated to a hatchery, where they have a much better chance to survive. If the eggs were left on the beach, they would face many threats such as getting washed away with the tide or getting poached. Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are carried to the beach and released.\\r\\nAnother major project, in India involved in preserving the olive ridley sea turtle population was carried out in Chennai, where the Chennai wildlife team collected close to 10,000 Olive Ridley turtle eggs along the Marina coast, of which 8,834 hatchlings were successfully released into the sea in a phased manner.[21]","input":"Where does the olive ridley sea turtle live?"},{"output":"oxygen","context":"The abundance of the chemical elements is a measure of the occurrence of the chemical elements relative to all other elements in a given environment. Abundance is measured in one of three ways: by the mass-fraction (the same as weight fraction); by the mole-fraction (fraction of atoms by numerical count, or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases); or by the volume-fraction. Volume-fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed gases such as planetary atmospheres, and is similar in value to molecular mole-fraction for gas mixtures at relatively low densities and pressures, and ideal gas mixtures. Most abundance values in this article are given as mass-fractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the abundance of oxygen in pure water can be measured in two ways: the mass fraction is about 89%, because that is the fraction of water's mass which is oxygen. However, the mole-fraction is 33.3333...%  because only 1 atom of 3 in water, H2O, is oxygen. As another example, looking at the mass-fraction abundance of hydrogen and helium in both the Universe as a whole and in the atmospheres of gas-giant planets such as Jupiter, it is 74% for hydrogen and 23ÿ25% for helium; while the (atomic) mole-fraction for hydrogen is 92%, and for helium is 8%, in these environments. Changing the given environment to  Jupiter's outer atmosphere, where hydrogen is diatomic while helium is not, changes the molecular mole-fraction (fraction of total gas molecules), as well as the fraction of atmosphere by volume, of hydrogen to about 86%, and of helium to 13%.[Note 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of chemical elements in the universe is dominated by the large amounts of  hydrogen and helium which were produced in the Big Bang. Remaining elements, making up only about 2% of the universe, were largely produced by supernovae and certain red giant stars. Lithium, beryllium and boron are rare because although they are produced by nuclear fusion, they are then destroyed by other reactions in the stars.[1][2] The elements from carbon to iron are relatively more common in the universe because of the ease of making them in supernova nucleosynthesis. Elements of higher atomic number than iron (element 26) become progressively more rare in the universe, because they increasingly absorb stellar energy in being produced. Elements with even atomic numbers are generally more common than their neighbors in the periodic table, also due to favorable energetics of formation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of elements in the Sun and outer planets is similar to that in the universe. Due to solar heating, the elements of Earth and the inner rocky planets of the Solar System have undergone an additional depletion of volatile hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, and carbon (which volatilizes as methane). The crust, mantle, and core of the Earth show evidence of chemical segregation plus some sequestration by density. Lighter silicates of aluminum are found in the crust, with more magnesium silicate in the mantle, while metallic iron and nickel compose the core. The abundance of elements in specialized environments, such as atmospheres, or oceans, or the human body, are primarily a product of chemical interactions with the medium in which they reside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elements ÿ that is, ordinary (baryonic) matter made of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are only a small part of the content of the Universe. Cosmological observations suggest that only 4.6% of the universe's energy (including the mass contributed by energy, E = mc2 ? m = E / c2) comprises the visible baryonic matter that constitutes stars, planets, and living beings. The rest is thought to be made up of dark energy (68%) and dark matter (27%).[4] These are forms of matter and energy believed to exist on the basis of scientific theory and observational deductions, but they have not been directly observed and their nature is not well understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost standard (baryonic) matter is found in intergalactic gas, stars, and interstellar clouds, in the form of atoms or ions (plasma), although it can be found in degenerate forms in extreme astrophysical settings, such as the high densities inside white dwarfs and neutron stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe; helium is second.  However, after this, the rank of abundance does not continue to correspond to the atomic number; oxygen has abundance rank 3, but atomic number 8. All others are substantially less common.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of the lightest elements is well predicted by the standard cosmological model, since they were mostly produced shortly (i.e., within a few hundred seconds) after the Big Bang, in a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Heavier elements were mostly produced much later, inside of stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrogen and helium are estimated to make up roughly 74% and 24% of all baryonic matter in the universe respectively. Despite comprising only a very small fraction of the universe, the remaining \\"heavy elements\\" can greatly influence astronomical phenomena. Only about 2% (by mass) of the Milky Way galaxy's disk is composed of heavy elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese other elements are generated by stellar processes.[5][6][7] In astronomy, a \\"metal\\" is any element other than hydrogen or helium. This distinction is significant because hydrogen and helium are the only elements that were produced in significant quantities in the Big Bang.  Thus, the metallicity of a galaxy or other object is an indication of stellar activity, after the Big Bang.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming supernovae. Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with increasing atomic number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following graph (note log scale) shows abundance of elements in the Solar System. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.[3]\\r\\nNearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. Since physical laws and processes are uniform throughout the universe, however, it is expected that these galaxies will likewise have evolved similar abundances of elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of elements is in keeping with their origin from the Big Bang and nucleosynthesis in a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, while the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by cosmic rays).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with carbon, elements have been produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). The effect of odd-numbered chemical elements generally being more rare in the universe was empirically noticed in 1914, and is known as the Oddo-Harkins rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoose correlations have been observed between estimated elemental abundances in the universe and the nuclear binding energy curve.  Roughly speaking, the relative stability of various atomic nuclides has exerted a strong influence on the relative abundance of elements formed in the Big Bang, and during the development of the universe thereafter.\\r\\n[9]\\r\\nSee the article about nucleosynthesis for the explanation on how certain nuclear fusion processes in stars (such as carbon burning, etc.) create the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.\\r\\n\\r\\nA further observed peculiarity is the jagged alternation between relative abundance and scarcity of adjacent atomic numbers in the elemental abundance curve, and a similar pattern of energy levels in the nuclear binding energy curve. This alternation is caused by the higher relative binding energy (corresponding to relative stability) of even atomic numbers compared with odd atomic numbers and is explained by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.[10]\\r\\nThe semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF), also called Weizs?cker's formula or the Bethe-Weizs?cker mass formula, gives a theoretical explanation of the overall shape of the curve of nuclear binding energy.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system. In turn, the natural history of the Earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98G1024?kg. In bulk, by mass, it is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bulk composition of the Earth by elemental-mass is roughly similar to the gross composition of the solar system, with the major differences being that Earth is missing a great deal of the volatile elements hydrogen, helium, neon, and nitrogen, as well as carbon which has been lost as volatile hydrocarbons. The remaining elemental composition is roughly typical of the \\"rocky\\" inner planets, which formed in the thermal zone where solar heat drove volatile compounds into space. The Earth retains oxygen as the second-largest component of its mass (and largest atomic-fraction), mainly from this element being retained in silicate minerals which have a very high melting point and low vapor pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass-abundance of the nine most abundant elements in the Earth's crust is approximately: oxygen 46%, silicon 28%, aluminum 8.2%, iron 5.6%, calcium 4.2%, sodium 2.5%, magnesium 2.4%, potassium 2.0%, and titanium 0.61%. Other elements occur at less than 0.15%. For a complete list, see abundance of elements in Earth's crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe graph at right illustrates the relative atomic-abundance of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust the part that is relatively accessible for measurements and estimation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the elements shown in the graph are classified into (partially overlapping) categories:\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that there are two breaks where the unstable (radioactive) elements technetium (atomic number: 43) and promethium (atomic number: 61) would be. These elements are surrounded by stable elements, yet both have relatively short half lives (~ 4 million years and ~ 18 years respectively). These are thus extremely rare, since any primordial initial fractions of these in pre-Solar System materials have long since decayed and disappeared. These two elements are now only produced naturally through the spontaneous fission of very heavy radioactive elements (for example, uranium, thorium, or the trace amounts of plutonium that exist in uranium ores), or by the interaction of certain other elements with cosmic rays. Both technetium and promethium have been identified spectroscopically in the atmospheres of stars, where they are produced by ongoing nucleosynthetic processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also breaks in the abundance graph where the six noble gases would be, since they are not chemically bound in the Earth's crust, and they are only generated by decay chains from radioactive elements in the crust, and are therefore extremely rare there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight naturally occurring very rare, highly radioactive elements (polonium, astatine, francium, radium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and plutonium) are not included, since any of these elements that were present at the formation of the Earth have decayed away eons ago, and their quantity today is negligible and is only produced from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxygen and silicon are notably the most common elements in the crust. On Earth and in rocky planets in general, silicon and oxygen are far more common than their cosmic abundance. The reason is that they combine with each other to form silicate minerals. In this way, they are the lightest of all of the two-percent \\"astronomical metals\\" (i.e., non-hydrogen and helium elements) to form a solid that is refractory to the Sun's heat, and thus cannot boil away into space. All elements lighter than oxygen have been removed from the crust in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Rare\\" earth elements is a historical misnomer. The persistence of the term reflects unfamiliarity rather than true rarity. The more abundant rare earth elements are similarly concentrated in the crust compared to commonplace industrial metals such as chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, or lead. The two least abundant rare earth elements (thulium and lutetium) are nearly 200 times more common than gold. However, in contrast to the ordinary base and precious metals, rare earth elements have very little tendency to become concentrated in exploitable ore deposits. Consequently, most of the world's supply of rare earth elements comes from only a handful of sources. Furthermore, the rare earth metals are all quite chemically similar to each other, and they are thus quite difficult to separate into quantities of the pure elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences in abundances of individual rare earth elements in the upper continental crust of the Earth represent the superposition of two effects, one nuclear and one geochemical. First, the rare earth elements with even atomic numbers (58Ce, 60Nd, ...) have greater cosmic and terrestrial abundances than the adjacent rare earth elements with odd atomic numbers (57La, 59Pr, ...). Second, the lighter rare earth elements are more incompatible (because they have larger ionic radii) and therefore more strongly concentrated in the continental crust than the heavier rare earth elements. In most rare earth ore deposits, the first four rare earth elements ÿ lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium ÿ constitute 80% to 99% of the total amount of rare earth metal that can be found in the ore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass-abundance of the eight most abundant elements in the Earth's mantle (see main article above) is approximately: oxygen 45%, magnesium 23%, silicon 22%, iron 5.8%, calcium 2.3%, aluminum 2.2%, sodium 0.3%, potassium 0.3%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mantle differs in elemental composition from the crust in having a great deal more magnesium and significantly more iron, while having much less aluminum and sodium.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to mass segregation, the core of the Earth is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most abundant elements in the ocean by proportion of mass in percent are oxygen (85.84), hydrogen (10.82), chlorine (1.94), sodium (1.08), magnesium (0.1292), sulfur (0.091), calcium (0.04), potassium (0.04), bromine (0.0067), carbon (0.0028), and boron  (0.00043).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe order of elements by volume-fraction (which is approximately molecular mole-fraction) in the atmosphere is nitrogen (78.1%), oxygen (20.9%),[14] argon (0.96%), followed by (in uncertain order) carbon and hydrogen because water vapor and carbon dioxide, which represent most of these two elements in the air, are variable components.   Sulfur, phosphorus, and all other elements are present in significantly lower proportions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the abundance curve graph (above right), argon, a significant if not major component of the atmosphere, does not appear in the crust at all. This is because the atmosphere has a far smaller mass than the crust, so argon remaining in the crust contributes little to mass-fraction there, while at the same time buildup of argon in the atmosphere has become large enough to be significant. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor a complete list of the abundance of elements in urban soils, see Abundances of the elements (data page)#Urban soils.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mass, human cells consist of 65ÿ90% water (H2O), and a significant portion of the remainder is composed of carbon-containing organic molecules. Oxygen therefore contributes a majority of a human body's mass, followed by carbon. Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. The next 0.75% is made up of the next five elements: potassium, sulfur, chlorine, sodium, and magnesium. Only 17 elements are known for certain to be necessary to human life, with one additional element (fluorine) thought to be helpful for tooth enamel strength. A few more trace elements may play some role in the health of mammals. Boron and silicon are notably necessary for plants but have uncertain roles in animals. The elements aluminium and silicon, although very common in the earth's crust, are conspicuously rare in the human body.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow is a periodic table highlighting nutritional elements.[16]","input":"What element is the most abundant on the earths crust?"},{"output":"the 2013ÿ14 Premier League season","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn association football, goal-line technology (sometimes referred to as a Goal Decision System)[1] is the use of electronic aid to determine if a goal has been scored or not. In detail, it is a method used to determine when the ball has completely crossed the goal line in between the goal-posts and underneath the crossbar with the assistance of electronic devices and at the same time assisting the referee in awarding a goal or not. The objective of goal-line technology (GLT) is not to replace the role of the officials, but rather to support them in their decision-making. The GLT must provide a clear indication as to whether the ball has fully crossed the line, and this information will serve to assist the referee in making his final decision.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared to similar technology in other sports, goal-line technology is a relatively recent addition to association football; its integration having been opposed by the sport's authorities. In July 2012, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) officially approved the use of goal line technology, amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use. Due to its expense, goal-line technology is only used at the highest levels of the game. Goal-line technology is currently used in the top European domestic leagues, and at major international competitions such as the 2014 Men's[3][4], 2018 Men's[5] and 2015 Women's FIFA World Cups.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn association football, a goal is scored if the whole of the ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and under the crossbar. In most cases, this is relatively unambiguous (goal nets being a low-tech way of verifying that the ball passed the correct side of the goalposts). Occasionally however situations occur when it is difficult for referees and their assistants to tell if a goal has been scored before a rebound, save, or defender's clearance from the goal area.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2012, goal-line technology has been permitted in matches. Text relating to goal-line technology can now be found within four of the Laws of the Game:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Laws themselves are not specific as to the nature of Goal Line technology systems, however other documentation from FIFA, which is cited by the Laws, goes into more detail. The FIFA Quality Programme for GLT Testing Manual[7] precisely define the requirements of the systems. Four basic requirements of a system are stipulated:\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFA have a system whereby a particular technology provider needs to show effectiveness to successfully obtain a license for their technology, then an installation within a particular stadium must pass a \\"final installation test\\" before use, and before each game the referee must check that the system is functional.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the expense of goal-line technology systems, the technology is only currently used at the very top levels of the game. In domestic competition, goal-line technology is only regularly used in a few major European leagues:\\r\\nSerie A,[10]\\r\\nLigue 1,[11]\\r\\nthe Bundesliga,[12]\\r\\nand the Premier League.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  January 2018[update], FIFA's website list 144 stadiums with licensed GLT installations, all of which use the Hawk-Eye system.[14] GoalControl is also licensed for use,[15] but is not currently installed in any stadium\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2012, competitions were unable to implement technology as provision was not made for it in the Laws. The Laws of association football are controlled by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), a body on which FIFA holds 50% of the voting power, sufficient to veto any changes to the laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared to other sports, association football was late to allow technology to assist with in-game decisions. The matter was a subject of debate within the game for over a decade with the game's lawmakers resisting calls for its implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 2000s various incidents incited discussion as to the potential for goal-line technology in the game.[16][17][18][19] The lack of use of technology in association football was contrasted with other sports, which had incorporated video replays and other systems into their rules.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to this, FIFA decided to test a system by Adidas in which a football with an embedded microchip would send a signal to the referee if it crossed a sensor going through the goal.[21] According to FIFA president Sepp Blatter, \\"We did different tests at the Under-17 World Cup in Peru but the evidence wasn't clear so we will carry out trials in junior competitions in 2007\\".[21] However, those trials did not materialise and by 2008, Blatter had rejected the system outright, describing the technology as 'only 95% accurate'.[21] FIFA and IFAB were resistant to introducing technology in the game, voting in March 2010 to permanently ditch the technology.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing several refereeing errors at the 2010 FIFA World Cup ÿ including the disallowed goal in Germany's 4ÿ1 victory over England, when Frank Lampard hit a shot from outside of the penalty box that bounced off the crossbar and over the line; the ball came back out and the goal was disallowed because the assistant referee did not call for a goal[23] ÿ Blatter announced that FIFA would reopen the goal-line technology discussion.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Euro 2012, UEFA president Michel Platini dismissed the need for goal-line technology, instead arguing for placing additional assistant referees behind the goal. However, in a Group D match with Ukraine losing 1ÿ0 to England, the on-field officials did not see Ukraine's Marko Devi?'s shot briefly cross the line before it was cleared by England's John Terry, although an offside in the build-up to the incident was too unnoticed by the match officials.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeeding calls for the use of technology, in July 2011 FIFA began a process of sanctioned tests that eventually resulted in the approval of the systems used in the current game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first stage of testing considered multiple goal-line technology systems, with the requirement that the system notified the referee of the decision within one second of the incident happening. The message needed to be relayed via a visual signal and vibration.[27] Tests were conducted by Empa between September and December 2011.[28] Tested systems included:[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 March 2012, IFAB announced that two of the eight proposed systems had proceeded to the second stage of testing. These were Hawk-Eye and GoalRef.[28] In the second phase of testing, the manufacturer of the technology chose a stadium to test its technology in a number of imagined scenarios. Testing was also conducted in professional training sessions and in laboratories to account for different climatic conditions and other magnetic field distortions. Tests on the watch to be worn by referees were also be undertaken. The systems also each underwent testing in some competitive matches.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoalRef technology underwent match testing in some Danish Superliga matches in the first half of 2012.[34][35] Following the second phase trials, on 5 July 2012 IFAB approved GoalRef in principle, making it available for use in professional matches under a set of revised Laws of the Game. Each installation however would also require licensing approval for use in the individual stadium, on a 12-month basis. The 2012 FIFA Club World Cup was the first tournament where GoalRef was used by a match referee. Goal Ref was used for the first time on 6 December 2012 in the first match of the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first match to use the Hawk-Eye goal-line technology was Eastleigh F.C. versus A.F.C. Totton in the Hampshire Senior Cup final at St Mary's Stadium, Southampton in England on 16 May 2012. Although it used Hawk-Eye, the system had no bearing on the referee's decisions and the system readings were only available to FIFA's independent testing agency.[37] The system was also in place for the technology's second test on 2 June for England's friendly match against Belgium.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the success of the trials, in July 2012 IFAB voted unanimously to officially amend the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) goal-line technology.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2012, FIFA announced it would introduce goal-line technology at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan.[39] Hawk-Eye technology was employed at Toyota Stadium, while GoalRef was used at International Stadium Yokohama.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoalControl, a camera-based system which uses 14 high-speed cameras located around the pitch and directed at both goals, was used at 2013 Confederations Cup, partly as a trial for use at the next year's World Cup.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Football Association announced that Hawk-Eye would be used in the 2013ÿ14 Premier League season.[42] On 16 December 2013, it was announced that Hawk-Eye would be used in three of the four quarter-finals and any subsequent matches in the League Cup.[43] The system was used when, on the very next day, in the Sunderland ÿ Chelsea quarter-final, a goal from Frank Lampard was allowed.[44] The first goal to be decisively awarded using goal-line technology in the English Premier League was Edin D?eko's goal for Manchester City against Cardiff City on 18 January 2014.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing success at the Confederations Cup, GoalControl was used at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The first goal given by the technology was in the 15 June 2014 group stage match between France and Honduras.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoal Line Technology was implemented across the major European competitions. In December 2014, the Bundesliga clubs approved goal-line technology that will be introduced at the start of the 2015ÿ16 Bundesliga season. The league picked the cheaper Hawk-Eye system over two German technologies.[47] GoalControl was introduced for Ligue 1 for the start of the 2015ÿ16 Ligue 1 season.[48][49] Ligue 1 later switched to using Hawk-Eye in 2018 after the GoalControl system made errors.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoal Line Technology was used in the UEFA Europa League final, UEFA Champions League, European Championship and Copa America for the first time in 2016.[51][52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile advocates for goal-line technology maintain that it would significantly reduce refereeing errors during play, there are also criticisms of the technology. Much of the criticism came from within FIFA itself including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Apart from the criticisms revolving around the technical aspects of the two proposed technologies, critics point out that such technology would impact on the human element of the game and remove the enjoyment of debating mistakes.[54] Sepp Blatter has been quoted as saying \\"Other sports regularly change the laws of the game to react to the new technology. ... We don't do it and this makes the fascination and the popularity of football\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study suggested that in the 2010ÿ11 Premier League season \\"errors took place nearly 30% of the time that video replays could help prevent\\", but some people claim that instant replays would interrupt the flow of the game and take away possible plays.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther critics believe it would be prohibitively expensive to implement the technology at all levels of the game and particularly for smaller/poorer football associations. FIFA officials have expressed a preference for 'better refereeing' as well as more match officials over implementing the technology.[57]\\r\\nAdvocates in turn cite the many examples of incorrect goal-line decisions deciding important games and point out that the technology has improved much since the initial trials carried out by FIFA.  Advocates contend that any extra help for the referee should outweigh arguments that it would lead to non-uniform rules (since not all football associations would be able to implement it).\\r\\n\\r\\nBlatter had been opposed to goal-line technology until Frank Lampard's disallowed goal in the 2010 World Cup  where the ball clearly crossed the line.[27][58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction of additional assistant referees, who are mostly positioned beside the goal-line, was partly in order to facilitate in such situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2013, MLS commissioner Don Garber confirmed that MLS would not adopt goal-line technology for the 2014 season, citing cost as the overriding factor. GoalControl installation would cost about $260,000 per stadium, and a further $3,900 for each game.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2014, the vast majority of teams in the two divisions of the German Bundesliga voted against introducing goal-line technology for financial reasons. The costs per club would have ranged from  ?250,000 for a chip inside the ball up to ?500,000 for Hawk-Eye or GoalControl. The manager of 1. FC K?ln, J?rg Schmadtke, summarized the vote with \\"The cost is so exorbitant, that using this (technology) is not acceptable\\".[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld governing body FIFA are set to make S300,000 from the Premier Leagues decision to install goal-line technology in all top-flight stadiums before the start of next season. Each of the 20 clubs will have to pay FIFA S15,000 to install, test and receive the FIFA quality seal for Hawk-Eyes camera-based system, which is expected to cost around S250,000 per ground in total. FIFA will also make an extra S15,000 from Wembley Stadium, which will have the technology installed for use in events such as the FA Cup semi-finals and final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scottish Professional Football League stated in December 2017 that it would not be implementing goal-line technology, as it is only affordable for the richest leagues in Europe.[62]","input":"When was goal line technology first introduced in the premier league?"},{"output":"T. truncatus","context":"Tursiops truncatus, commonly known as the common bottlenose dolphin or the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (and in older literature simply as the bottlenose dolphin, a term now applied to the genus), is the most well-known species from the family Delphinidae.\\r\\nCommon bottlenose dolphins are the most familiar dolphins due to the wide exposure they receive in captivity in marine parks and dolphinaria, and in movies and television programs.[4] T. truncatus is the largest species of the beaked dolphins.[5] They inhabit temperate and tropical oceans throughout the world, and are absent only from polar waters.[4][5][6][2][7] All bottlenose dolphins were previously known as T. truncatus, but recently the genus has been split into three species, T. truncatus, T. aduncus (Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin)[2][7] and T. australis (Burrunan dolphin). Although T. truncatus has been traditionally called the bottlenose dolphin,[3][8] many authors have used the name common bottlenose dolphin for this species since two other species of bottlenose dolphins were described.[1][9][10] The dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. Considerable genetic variation has been described among members of this species, even between neighboring populations, and so many experts believe multiple species may be included within T. truncatus.[3][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common bottlenose dolphin is grey in color and may be between 2 and 4?m (6.6 and 13.1?ft) long, and weighs between 150 and 650?kg (330 and 1,430?lb).[8] Males are generally larger and heavier than females. In most parts of the world, the adult's length is between 2.5 and 3.5?m (8.2 and 11.5?ft) with weight ranging between 200 and 500?kg (440 and 1,100?lb).[5][9] Newborn calves are between 0.8 and 1.4?m (2?ft 7?in and 4?ft 7?in) long and weigh between 15 and 30?kg (33 and 66?lb).[9] They can live as long as 40ÿ50 years.[11] Sexual maturity varies by population, and ranges from 5ÿ14 years of age.[11] Dolphins have a short and well-defined snout that looks like an old-fashioned gin bottle, which is the source for their common name.[12] Like all whales and dolphins, though, the snout is not a functional nose; the nose has instead evolved into the blowhole on the top of their heads. Their necks are more flexible than other dolphins' due to five of their seven vertebrae not being fused together as is seen in other dolphin species.[13]\\r\\nCommon bottlenose dolphins live in groups called pods that typically number about 15 individuals, but group size varies from pairs of dolphins to over 100 or even occasionally over 1000 animals for short periods of time.[9] Their diets consist mainly of eels, squid, shrimp and wide variety of fishes.[1][6] They do not chew their food, instead swallowing it whole. Dolphin groups often work as a team to harvest schools of fish, though they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is a form of sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echoes to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey.[14] Dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks emitted from the blowhole, whistles emitted from nasal sacs below the blowhole, and sounds emitted through body language, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water. Their heads contain an oily substance that both acts as an acoustic lens and protects the brain case.\\r\\nCommon bottlenose dolphins typically live to be around 25 years old, in captivity they have been known to live to around 50.\\r\\nTursiops truncatus can be found in the temperate, subtropical and tropical oceans worldwide.[15] Some bottlenose populations live closer to the shore (inshore populations) and others live further out to sea (offshore populations). Generally, offshore populations are larger, darker, and have proportionally shorter fins and beaks. Offshore populations can migrate up to 4,200?km (2,600?mi) in a season, but inshore populations tend to move less. However, some inshore populations make long migrations in response to El Ni?o events.[9]\\r\\nTursiops truncatus has a bigger brain than humans.[16] Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence include tests of mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition.[17][18][19][20][21][22] This intelligence has driven considerable interaction with humans. Common bottlenose dolphins are popular in aquarium shows and television programs such as Flipper.[23] They have also been trained for military uses such as locating sea mines or detecting and marking enemy divers, as for example in the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program.[24][25] In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish toward the fishermen and eating the fish that escape the fishermen's nets.[26]\\r\\nSome interactions with humans are harmful to the dolphins. Dolphin hunting industry exists in multiple countries including Japan, where common bottlenose dolphins are hunted for food annually in the town of Taiji,[27] and the Faroe Islands. Also, dolphins are sometimes killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing.[28][29]\\r\\nTi?o was a well-known solitary female bottlenose dolphin that was first spotted in the town of S?o Sebasti?o in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed humans to interact with her. The dolphin became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which later earned her the nickname killer dolphin.\\r\\nThe North Sea, Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Sea populations of the common bottlenose dolphin are listed on Appendix II[30] of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) of the Bonn Convention), since they have an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international cooperation organized by tailored agreements.[31]\\r\\nThe species is covered by the Agreement on Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS), the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region,[32] and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.[33]","input":"What is the species of a bottlenose dolphin?"},{"output":"Hand-to-hand combat","context":"Hand-to-hand combat (sometimes abbreviated as HTH or H2H) is a lethal or non-lethal physical confrontation between two or more persons at very short range (grappling distance, or within the physical reach of a handheld weapon) that does not involve the use of ranged weapons.[1] While the phrase \\"hand-to-hand\\" appears to refer to unarmed combat, the term is generic and may include use of melee weapons such as knives, sticks, batons, spears, or improvised weapons such as entrenching tools.[1] While the term hand-to-hand combat originally referred principally to engagements by combatants on the battlefield, it can also refer to any personal physical engagement by two or more people, including law enforcement officers, civilians, and criminals.[1]\\r\\nCombat within close quarters (to a range just beyond grappling distance) is commonly termed close combat or close-quarters combat.

Other variations include the gladiator spectacles of ancient Rome and medieval tournament events such as jousting.\\r\\nMilitary organizations have always taught some sort of unarmed combat for conditioning and as a supplement to armed combat. Soldiers in China were trained in unarmed combat as early as the Zhou Dynasty (1022 BCE to 256 BCE).\\r\\nDespite major technological changes such as the use of gunpowder, the machine gun in the Russo-Japanese War and the trench warfare of World War I, hand-to-hand fighting methods such as bayonet remained common in modern military training, though the importance of formal training declined after 1918. By 1944 some German rifles were being produced without bayonet lugs.\\r\\nClose Quarters Combat, or World War II combatives, was largely codified by William Ewart Fairbairn and Eric Anthony Sykes. Also known for their eponymous Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, Fairbairn and Sykes had worked in the Shanghai Municipal Police of the International Settlement (1854ÿ1943) of Shanghai in the 1920s, widely acknowledged as the most dangerous port city in the world due to a heavy opium trade run by organised crime (the Chinese Triads).\\r\\nAfter the May Thirtieth Movement riots, which resulted in a police massacre, Fairbairn was charged with developing an auxiliary squad for riot control and aggressive policing. After absorbing the most appropriate elements from a variety of martial-arts experts, from China, Japan and elsewhere, he condensed these arts into a practical combat system he called Defendu. He and his police team went on to field-test these skills on the streets of Shanghai; Fairbairn himself used his combat system effectively in over 2000 documented encounters, including over 600 lethal-force engagements.[2] The aim of his combat system was simply to be as brutally effective as possible. It was also a system that, unlike traditional Eastern martial-arts that required years of intensive training, could be digested by recruits relatively quickly. The method incorporated training in point shooting and gun combat techniques, as well as the effective use of more ad hoc weapons such as chairs or table legs.\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, Fairbairn was brought back to Britain, and, after demonstrating the effectiveness of his techniques, was recruited to train the British commandos in his combat method. During this period, he expanded his 'Shanghai Method' into the 'Silent Killing Close Quarters Combat method' for military application. This became standard combat training for all British Special Operations personnel. He also designed the pioneering Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, which was adopted for use by British and American Special Forces. In 1942, he published a textbook for close quarters combat training called Get Tough.[2][3]\\r\\nU.S. Army officers Rex Applegate and Anthony Biddle were taught Fairbairn's methods at a training facility in Scotland, and adopted the program for the training of OSS operatives at a newly opened camp near Lake Ontario in Canada. Applegate published his work in 1943, called Kill or Get Killed.[4] During the war, training was provided to British Commandos, the Devil's Brigade, OSS, U.S. Army Rangers and Marine Raiders.\\r\\nOther combat systems designed for military combat were introduced elsewhere, including European Unifight, Soviet/Russian Sambo, Army hand-to-hand fight, Chinese military Sanshou/Sanda, Israeli Kapap and Krav Maga. The prevalence and style of hand-to-hand combat training often changes based on perceived need. Elite units such as special forces and commando units tend to place higher emphasis on hand-to-hand combat training.\\r\\nAlthough hand-to-hand fighting was accorded less importance in major militaries after World War II, insurgency conflicts such as the Vietnam War, low intensity conflict and urban warfare have prompted many armies to pay more attention to this form of combat. When such fighting includes firearms designed for close-in fighting, it is often referred to as Close Quarters Battle (CQB) at the platoon or squad level, or Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT) at higher tactical levels.","input":"What fighting style does the us military use?"},{"output":"45.09 kilometers (28.02 miles)","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch patch for Opportunity, featuring Duck Dodgers (Daffy Duck)\\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover ÿ B) or MER-1, is a robotic rover active on Mars since 2004.[1]  Launched on July 7, 2003 as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A) touched down on the other side of the planet.[7] With a planned 90 sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 earth days), Spirit functioned until getting stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while Opportunity remains active as of August 26, 2018 or 5529 sols since landing, having exceeded its operating plan by 14?years, 122?days (in Earth time). Opportunity has continued to move, make scientific observations, and report back to Earth for over 55 times its designed lifespan. As of January 23, 2018, the rover had traveled 45.09 kilometers (28.02 miles).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMission highlights include the initial 90 sol mission, finding extramartian meteorites such as Heat Shield Rock (Meridiani Planum meteorite), and over two years studying Victoria crater. The rover survived dust-storms and in 2011 reached Endeavour crater, which has been described as a \\"second landing site\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the 2018 dust storms on Mars, Opportunity entered hibernation on June 12 for several weeks until the atmosphere clears again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary surface mission for Opportunity was planned to last 90 sols (92 Earth days). The mission has received several extensions and has been operating for 5327 days since landing. An archive of weekly updates on the rover's status can be found at the Opportunity Update Archive.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom its initial landing, by chance, into an impact crater amidst an otherwise generally flat plain, Opportunity has successfully investigated soil and rock samples and taken panoramic photos of its landing site. Its sampling allowed NASA scientists to make hypotheses concerning the presence of hematite and past presence of water on the surface of Mars. Following this, it was directed to travel across the surface of Mars to investigate another crater site, Endurance crater, which it investigated from June ÿ December 2004. Subsequently, Opportunity examined the impact site of its own heat shield and discovered an intact meteorite, now known as Heat Shield Rock, on the surface of Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom late April to early June of 2005, Opportunity was perilously lodged in a sand dune, with several wheels buried in the sand. Over a six-week period Earth-based physical simulations were performed to decide how best to extract the rover from its position without risking a permanent immobilization of the valuable vehicle. Successful maneuvering a few centimeters at a time eventually freed the rover, which resumed its travels.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity was directed to proceed in a southerly direction to Erebus crater, a large, shallow, partially buried crater and a stopover on the way south towards Victoria crater, between October 2005 and March 2006. It experienced some mechanical problems with its robotic arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late September 2006, Opportunity reached Victoria crater and explored along the rim in a clockwise direction. In June 2007 it returned to Duck Bay, its original arrival point; in September 2007 it entered the crater to begin a detailed study. In August 2008, Opportunity left Victoria crater for Endeavour crater, which it reached on August 9, 2011.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nHere at the rim of the Endeavour crater the rover moved around a geographic feature named Cape York. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had detected phyllosilicates there, and the rover analyzed the rocks with its instruments to check this sighting on the ground.\\r\\nThis structure was analyzed in depth until summer 2013. At May 2013 the rover was heading south to a hill named Solander Point.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity's total odometry as of June 27, 2016 (sol 4417) was 42.85?km (26.63?mi), while the dust factor is 0.725.\\r\\n[11] Since January 2013, the solar array dust factor (one of the determinants of solar power production) varied from a relatively dusty 0.467 on December 5, 2013 (sol 3507) to a relatively clean 0.964 on May 13, 2014 (sol 3662).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2014, NASA reported that Opportunity was suffering from \\"amnesia\\" events in which the rover fails to write data, e.g. telemetry information, to non-volatile memory. The hardware failure is believed to be due to an age-related fault in one of the rover's seven memory banks. As a result, NASA had aimed to force the rover's software to ignore the failed memory bank,[13] however amnesia events continued to occur which eventually resulted in vehicle resets.  In light of this, on Sol 4027 (May 23, 2015), the rover was configured to operate in RAM-only mode, completely avoiding the use of non-volatile memory for storage.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of May 2018 into the early days of June, Opportunity was still functioning on the surface of Mars, and engaged in further scientific exploration.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early June, the large global-scale dust storms hit and within a few days the rover was not getting enough power to maintain communications, with last normal communication on June 10, 2018. NASA stated they do not expect to resume communication until after the global dust storm subsides.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission are to:[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the next two decades, NASA will continue to conduct missions to address whether life ever arose on Mars. The search begins with determining whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life, as we understand it, requires water, so the history of water on Mars is critical to finding out if the Martian environment was ever conducive to life. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers do not have the ability to detect life directly, they are offering very important information on the habitability of the environment in the planet's history.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity (along with its twin, Spirit) is a six-wheeled, solar-powered robot standing 1.5 meters (4.9?ft) high, 2.3 meters (7.5?ft) wide, and 1.6 meters (5.2?ft) long and weighing 180 kilograms (400?lb). Six wheels on a rocker-bogie system enable mobility. Each wheel has its own motor, the vehicle is steered at front and rear and is designed to operate safely at tilts of up to 30 degrees. Maximum speed is 5 centimeters per second (2.0?in/s) although average speed is about a fifth of this (0.89 centimeters per second (0.35?in/s)). Both Spirit and Opportunity have pieces of the fallen World Trade Center's metal on them that were \\"turned into shields to protect cables on the drilling mechanisms\\".[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar arrays generate about 140 watts for up to fourteen hours per Martian day (sol) while rechargeable lithium ion batteries store energy for use at night. Opportunity's onboard computer uses a 20?MHz RAD6000 CPU with 128?MB of DRAM, 3?MB of EEPROM, and 256?MB of flash memory. The rover's operating temperature ranges from ?40 to +40?C (?40 to 104?F) and radioisotope heaters provide a base level of heating, assisted by electrical heaters when necessary.[20] A gold film and a layer of silica aerogel provide insulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunications depends on an omnidirectional low-gain antenna communicating at a low data rate and a steerable high-gain antenna, both in direct contact with Earth. A low gain antenna is also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed science/engineering instruments include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rover arm holds the following instruments:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cameras produce 1024-pixel by 1024-pixel images, the data is compressed with ICER, stored, and transmitted later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rover's name was chosen through a NASA sponsored student essay competition.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of watt-hours per sol collected by the rover.[22][clarification needed] The rover uses a combination of solar cells and a rechargeable chemical battery.[23] This class of rover has two rechargeable lithium batteries, each composed of 8 cells with 10 amp-hour capacity.[24] At the start of the mission the solar panels could provide up to around 900 watt-hours to recharge the battery and power system in one Sol, but this can vary due to a variety of factors.[23] In Eagle crater the cells were producing about 840 watt-hours, but by Sol 319 in December 2004, it had dropped to 730 watt-hours.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Earth, Mars has seasonal variations that reduce sunlight during winter.  However, since the Martian year is longer than that of the Earth, the seasons fully rotate roughly once every 2 Earth years.[26] By 2016, MER-B had endured seven Martian winters, during which times power levels drop which can mean the rover avoids doing activities that use a lot of power.[26] During its first winter power levels dropped to under 300 watt-hours per day for two months, but some later winters were not as bad.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother factor that can reduce received power is dust in the atmosphere, especially dust storms.[27] Dust storms have occurred quite frequently when Mars is closest to the Sun.[27] Global dust storms in 2007 reduced power levels for Opportunity and Spirit so much they could only run for a few minutes each day.[27] Due to the 2018 dust storms on Mars, Opportunity entered hibernation mode on June 12 until the atmosphere clears.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity's launch was managed by NASA's Launch Services Program. This was the first launch of the Delta II Heavy. The launch period went from June 25 to July 15, 2003. The first launch attempt occurred on June 28, 2003, but the spacecraft launched nine days later on July 7, 2003 due to delays for range safety and winds, then later to replace items on the rocket (insulation and a battery). Each day had two instantaneous launch opportunities. On the day of launch, the launch was delayed to the second opportunity (11:18?p.m. EDT) in order to fix a valve.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late December 2004, Opportunity reached the impact site of its heat shield, and took a panorama around Sol 325.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity has provided substantial evidence in support of the mission's primary scientific goals: to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. In addition to investigating the water, Opportunity has also obtained astronomical observations and atmospheric data.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonoring Opportunity's great contribution to the exploration of Mars, an asteroid was named Opportunity: 39382 Opportunity.[32] The name was proposed by Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld who, along with Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Tom Gehrels, discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960. Opportunity's lander is Challenger Memorial Station.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 28, 2014, it was announced that Opportunity, having traversed over 40?km (25?mi), had become the rover achieving the longest off-world distance, surpassing the previous record of 39?km (24?mi) on the Moon by Lunokhod 2.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 24, 2015, NASA celebrated Opportunity having traveled the distance of a marathon race, 42.195 kilometers (26.219?mi), from the start of Opportunity's landing and traveling on Mars.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sol 3894 (Jan. 6, 2015) Opportunity reached the summit of \\"Cape Tribulation,\\" which is 443 feet (135 meters) above \\"Botany Bay\\" level and the highest point yet reached by the rover on western rim of Endeavour Crater according to NASA.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rover can take pictures with its different cameras, but only the PanCam camera has the ability to photograph a scene with different color filters. The panorama views are usually built up from PanCam images. As of February 3, 2018, Opportunity had returned 224,642 pictures.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA selection of panoramas from the mission:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of a rover  traverse map featuring a line showing path of the rover, and mission sols, which are Mars days counted from its landing and typical of Mars surface mission time reporting.

It was called in response to the Intolerable Acts passed by the British Parliament, which the British referred to as the Coercive Acts, with which the British intended to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party.\\r\\nThe Congress met briefly to consider options, including an economic boycott of British trade and drawing up a list of rights and grievances; in the end, they petitioned King George III for redress of those grievances.\\r\\nThe Congress also called for another Continental Congress in the event that their petition was unsuccessful in halting enforcement of the Intolerable Acts. Their appeal to the Crown had no effect, and so the Second Continental Congress was convened the following year to organize the defense of the colonies at the onset of the American Revolutionary War. The delegates also urged each colony to set up and train its own militia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congress met from September 5 to October 26, 1774. Peyton Randolph presided over the proceedings; Henry Middleton took over as President of the Congress from October 22 to 26. Charles Thomson, leader of Philadelphia Committee of Correspondence, was selected to be Secretary of the Continental Congress.[1]\\r\\nThe delegates who attended were not of one mind concerning why they were there. Conservatives such as Joseph Galloway, John Dickinson, John Jay, and Edward Rutledge believed their task to be forging policies to pressure Parliament to rescind its unreasonable acts. Their ultimate goal was to develop a reasonable solution to the difficulties and bring about reconciliation between the Colonies and Great Britain. Others such as Patrick Henry, Roger Sherman, Samuel Adams, and John Adams believed their task to be developing a decisive statement of the rights and liberties of the Colonies. Their ultimate goal was to end what they felt to be the abuses of parliamentary authority, and to retain their rights which had been guaranteed under both Colonial charters and the English constitution.[2]\\r\\nRoger Sherman denied the legislative authority of Parliament, and Patrick Henry believed that the Congress needed to develop a completely new system of government, independent from Great Britain, for the existing Colonial governments were already dissolved.[3] In contrast to these ideas, Joseph Galloway put forward a \\"Plan of Union\\" which suggested that an American legislative body be formed with some authority, whose consent would be required for imperial measures.[3][4]\\r\\nIn the end, the voices of compromise carried the day. Rather than calling for independence, the First Continental Congress passed and signed the Continental Association in its Declaration and Resolves, which called for a boycott of British goods to take effect in December 1774. It requested that local Committees of Safety enforce the boycott and regulate local prices for goods. These resolutions adopted by the Congress did not endorse any legal power of Parliament to regulate trade, but consented, nonetheless, to the operation of acts for that purpose. Furthermore, they did not repudiate control by the royal prerogative, which was explicitly acknowledged in the Petition to the King a few days later.\\r\\nThe Congress had two primary accomplishments. The first was a compact among the Colonies to boycott British goods beginning on December 1, 1774.[5] The West Indies were threatened with a boycott unless the islands agreed to non-importation of British goods.[6] Imports from Britain dropped by 97 percent in 1775, compared with the previous year.[5] Committees of observation and inspection were to be formed in each Colony to ensure compliance with the boycott. All of the Colonial Houses of Assembly approved the proceedings of the Congress, with the exception of New York.[7]\\r\\nIf the Intolerable Acts were not repealed, the Colonies would also cease exports to Britain after September 10, 1775.[5] The boycott was successfully implemented, but its potential for altering British colonial policy was cut off by the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\nThe second accomplishment of the Congress was to provide for a Second Continental Congress to meet on May 10, 1775. In addition to the Colonies which had sent delegates to the First Continental Congress, the Congress resolved on October 21, 1774, to send letters of invitation to Quebec, Saint John's Island (now Prince Edward Island), Nova Scotia, Georgia, East Florida, and West Florida.[8] However, letters appear to have been sent only to Quebec (three letters in all). None of these other colonies sent delegates to the opening of the Second Congress, though a delegation from Georgia arrived the following July.[9]","input":"What was a goal of the first continental congress?"},{"output":"Czech","context":"Czech (/?t??k/; ?e?tina Czech pronunciation: [?t????c?na]), historically also Bohemian[6] (/bo??hi?mi?n, b?-/;[7] lingua Bohemica in Latin), is a West Slavic language of the CzechÿSlovak group,[6] which is extensively influenced by Latin[8] and German.[9] Spoken by over 10 million people, it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree.[10]\\r\\nThe Czecho-Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, and the standardisation of Czech and Slovak within the CzechÿSlovak dialect continuum emerges in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival. The main vernacular, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of Prague, but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic. The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.\\r\\nCzech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising five vowels (each short or long) and twenty-five consonants (divided into \\"hard\\", \\"neutral\\" and \\"soft\\" categories). Words may contain uncommon (or complicated) consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a raised alveolar trill, which is not known to occur as a phoneme in any other language, represented by the grapheme ?. Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech is a member of the West Slavic sub-branch of the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. This branch includes Polish, Kashubian, Upper and Lower Sorbian and Slovak. Slovak is the closest language genetic neighbor of Czech, followed by Polish and Silesian.[11]\\r\\nThe West Slavic languages are spoken in Central Europe. Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more-restricted distinction between \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" consonants (see Phonology below).[11]\\r\\nThe term \\"Old Czech\\" is applied to the period predating the 16th century, with the earliest records of the high medieval period also classified as \\"early Old Czech\\", but it is also possible to speak simply about \\"Medieval Czech\\".\\r\\nAround the 7th century, the Slavic expansion reached Central Europe, settling on the eastern fringes of the Frankish Empire. The West Slavic polity of Great Moravia formed by the 9th century. The Christianization of Bohemia took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the Czech-Slovak group within West Slavic began around that time, marked among other things by its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant (/?/)[12] and consistent stress on the first syllable.[13]\\r\\nThe Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries. Literary works written in Czech appear in the early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century. The first complete Bible translation also dates to this period.[14] Old Czech texts, including poetry and cookbooks, were produced outside the university as well.[15]\\r\\nLiterary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the Bohemian Reformation. Jan Hus contributed significantly to the standardization of Czech orthography, advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners (particularly in religion) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language.[14]\\r\\nThere was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century.[16] In the 16th century, the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent, marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics, especially Slovak Jesuits, beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on the language of the Trnava region.\\r\\nThe publication of the Kralice Bible between 1579 and 1593 (the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages) became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries.\\r\\nIn 1615, the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom. After the Bohemian Revolt (of predominantly Protestant aristocracy) which was defeated by the Habsburgs in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the Thirty Years' War had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language. In 1627, Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia, especially among the upper classes.[17]\\r\\nThe modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century.[18] By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty.[19] Changes include the morphological shift of  to ej and  to  (although  survives for some uses) and the merging of  and the former ej.[20] Sometime before the 18th century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /?/ which survives in Slovak.[21]\\r\\nWith the beginning of the national revival of the mid-18th century, Czech historians began to emphasize their people's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries, rebelling against the Counter-Reformation (the Habsburg re-catholization efforts which had denigrated Czech and other non-Latin languages).[22] Czech philologists studied sixteenth-century texts, advocating the return of the language to high culture.[23] This period is known as the Czech National Revival[24] (or Renaissance).[23]\\r\\nDuring the national revival, in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovsky released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled Ausfhrliches Lehrgeb?ude der b?hmischen Sprache (Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language). Dobrovsky had intended his book to be descriptive, and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language. However, Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovsky's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival.[24] Changes during this time included spelling reform (notably,  in place of the former j and j in place of g), the use of t (rather than ti) to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns (which had been a late borrowing from German).[21] These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak.[25] Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal, widespread use.[24]\\r\\nAdherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from Common Czech (a widespread, informal register), such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined. This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language.[26]\\r\\nIn 2005 and 2007, Czech was spoken by about 10 million residents of the Czech Republic.[17][27] A Eurobarometer survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the first language of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech, the third-highest in the European Union (behind Greece and Hungary).[28]\\r\\nCzech, the official language of the Czech Republic (a member of the European Union since 2004), is one of the EU's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia.[28] Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages. The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic (98.77 percent), Slovakia (24.86 percent), Portugal (1.93 percent), Poland (0.98 percent) and Germany (0.47 percent).[29]\\r\\nCzech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities. Since it is a recognised minority language in Slovakia, Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so.[30]\\r\\nImmigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914. Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools, and is taught at Czech heritage centers. Large communities of Czech Americans live in the states of Texas, Nebraska and Wisconsin.[31] In the 2000 United States Census, Czech was reported as the most-common language spoken at home (besides English) in Valley, Butler and Saunders Counties, Nebraska and Republic County, Kansas. With the exception of Spanish (the non-English language most commonly spoken at home nationwide), Czech was the most-common home language in over a dozen additional counties in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota and Minnesota.[32] As of 2009, 70,500 Americans spoke Czech as their first language (49th place nationwide, behind Turkish and ahead of Swedish).[33]\\r\\nThe main vernacular is \\"Common Czech\\", based on the dialect of the Prague region. Other Bohemian dialects have become marginalized, while Moravian dialects remain more widespread, with a political movement for Moravian linguistic revival active since the 1990s.\\r\\nThe main Czech vernacular, spoken primarily near Prague but also throughout the country, is known as Common Czech (obecn ?e?tina). This is an academic distinction; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with vernacular (or incorrect) Czech.[34] Compared to standard Czech, Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution.[35]\\r\\nCommon Czech has become ubiquitous in most parts of the Czech Republic since the later 20th century. It is usually defined as an interdialect used in common speech in Bohemia and western parts of Moravia (by about two thirds of all inhabitants of the Czech Republic). Common Czech is not codified, but some of its elements have become adopted in the written standard. Since the second half of the 20th century, Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected, as a consequence of media influence. Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media.[35]\\r\\nCommon Czech is characterized by quite regular differences from the standard morphology and phonology. These variations are more or less common to all Common Czech dialects:\\r\\nExample of declension (with the comparison with the standard Czech):\\r\\nmlady ?lovk ÿ young man/person, mlad lid ÿ young people, mlady stt ÿ young state, mlad ?ena ÿ young woman, mlad zv?e ÿ young animal\\r\\nApart from the Common Czech vernacular, there remain a variety of other Bohemian dialect, mostly in marginal rural areas. Dialect use began to weaken in the second half of the 20th century, and by the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech.[36] Although Czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a Slavic language, this interest has focused primarily on modern standard Czech and historical texts rather than dialects.[34]\\r\\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Bohemian dialects:[37]\\r\\nThe Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian (morav?tina). In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, \\"Bohemian-Moravian-Slovak\\" was a language citizens could register as speaking (with German, Polish and several others).[38] Of the Czech dialects, only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the Czech Statistical Office. As of 2011, 62,908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45,561 were diglossal (speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages).[39]\\r\\nBeginning in the sixteenth century, some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak;[16] the southeastern Moravian dialects, in particular, are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech. These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages,[40] using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak.[41]\\r\\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Moravian dialects:[37]\\r\\nIn a 1964 textbook on Czech dialectology, B?etislav Koudela used the following sentence to highlight phonetic differences between dialects:[42]\\r\\nCzech and Slovak have been considered mutually intelligible; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages. Since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, mutual intelligibility has declined for younger speakers, probably because Czech speakers now experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa.[43]\\r\\nIn phonetic differences, Czech is characterized by a glottal stop before initial vowels and Slovak by its less-frequent use of long vowels than Czech;[44] however, Slovak has long forms of the consonants r and l when they function as vowels.[45] Phonemic differences between the two languages are generally consistent, typical of two dialects of a language. Grammatically, although Czech (unlike Slovak) has a vocative case,[44] both languages share a common syntax.[16]\\r\\nOne study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation;[46] Slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the nominative to the locative case, Praha becomes Praze in Czech and Prahe in Slovak). The two lexicons are generally considered similar, with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech.[16]\\r\\nThe similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th-century scholars who called themselves \\"Czechoslavs\\" (?echoslovan), believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and (to a lesser extent) Hungarians and other Slavs.[47] During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918ÿ1938), although \\"Czechoslovak\\" was designated as the republic's official language, both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II), literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech,[16] due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, \\"Czechoslovak\\" has referred to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.[48]\\r\\nCzech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic, Baltic and other Indo-European roots. Although most verbs have Balto-Slavic origins, pronouns, prepositions and some verbs have wider, Indo-European roots.[49] Some loanwords have been restructured by folk etymology to resemble native Czech words (h?bitov, \\"graveyard\\" and listina, \\"list\\").[50]\\r\\nMost Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods. Earlier loanwords, primarily from German,[51] Greek and Latin,[52] arrived before the Czech National Revival. More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and French,[51] and also from Hebrew, Arabic and Persian. Many Russian loanwords, principally animal names and naval terms, also exist in Czech.[53]\\r\\nAlthough older German loanwords were colloquial, recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture.[51] During the nineteenth century, words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots; \\"music\\" is muzyka in Polish and ֿ (muzyka) in Russian, but in Czech it is hudba.[52] Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into English and other languagesfor example, robot (from robota, \\"labor\\")[54] and polka (from polka, \\"Polish woman\\" or from \\"p?lka\\" \\"half\\").[55]\\r\\nThe modern written standard is directly based on the standardisation during the Czech National Revival in the 1830s, significantly influenced by Josef Jungmann's Czech-German dictionary published during 1834ÿ1839. Jungmann used vocabulary of the Bible of Kralice (1579ÿ1613) period and of the language used by his contemporaries. He borrowed words not present in Czech from other Slavic languages or created neologisms.[56]\\r\\nCzech contains ten basic vowel phonemes, and three more found only in loanwords. They are /a/, /?/, /?/, /o/, and /u/, their long counterparts /a?/, /??/, /i?/, /o?/ and /u?/, and three diphthongs, /ou?/, /au?/ and /?u?/. The latter two diphthongs and the long /o?/ are exclusive to loanwords.[57] Vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed.[58] Each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable, except for enclitics (minor, monosyllabic, unstressed syllables). In all words of more than two syllables, every odd-numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to vowel length, and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features (such as English).[59]\\r\\nVoiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word, or when they are followed by unvoiced consonants.[60] Czech consonants are categorized as \\"hard\\", \\"neutral\\" or \\"soft\\":\\r\\nThis distinction describes the declension patterns of nouns, which is based on the category of a noun's ending consonant. Hard consonants may not be followed by i or  in writing, or soft ones by y or y (except in loanwords such as kilogram).[61] Neutral consonants may take either character. Hard consonants are sometimes known as \\"strong\\", and soft ones as \\"weak\\".[62]\\r\\nThe phoneme represented by the letter ? (capital ?) is considered unique to Czech.[63] It represents the raised alveolar non-sonorant trill (IPA: [r?]), a sound somewhere between Czech's r and ? (example: ?\\"?eka\\" (river)?(help{info)),[63] and is present in Dvo?k.\\r\\nThe consonants /r/ and /l/ can be syllabic, acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel. This can be difficult for non-native speakers to pronounce, and Str? prst skrz krk (\\"Stick [your] finger down [your] throat\\") is a Czech tongue twister.[64]\\r\\nConsonants\\r\\nVowels\\r\\nSlavic grammar is fusional; its nouns, verbs, and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions, and the easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited.[65] Slavic-language inflection is complex and pervasive, inflecting for case, gender and number in nouns and tense, aspect, mood, person and subject number and gender in verbs.[66]\\r\\nParts of speech include adjectives, adverbs, numbers, interrogative words, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections.[67] Adverbs are primarily formed by taking the final y or  of an adjective and replacing it with e, , or o.[68] Negative statements are formed by adding the affix ne- to the verb of a clause, with one exception: je (he, she or it is) becomes nen.[69]\\r\\nBecause Czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence (instead of relying on word order, as English does), its word order is flexible. As a pro-drop language, in Czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb.[70] Enclitics (primarily auxiliary verbs and pronouns) must appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence, after the first stressed unit. The first slot must contain a subject and object, a main form of a verb, an adverb or a conjunction (except for the light conjunctions a, \\"and\\", i, \\"and even\\" or ale, \\"but\\").[71]\\r\\nCzech syntax has a subjectÿverbÿobject sentence structure. In practice, however, word order is flexible and used for topicalization and focus. Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction (like English), colloquial word-order changes frequently produce the passive voice. For example, to change \\"Peter killed Paul\\" to \\"Paul was killed by Peter\\" the order of subject and object is inverted: Petr zabil Pavla (\\"Peter killed Paul\\") becomes \\"Paul, Peter killed\\" (Pavla zabil Petr). Pavla is in the accusative case, the grammatical object (in this case, the victim) of the verb.[72]\\r\\nA word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized, unless an upward intonation indicates that the sentence is a question:[73]\\r\\nIn portions of Bohemia (including Prague), questions such as J pes bagetu? without an interrogative word (such as co, \\"what\\" or kdo, \\"who\\") are intoned in a slow rise from low to high, quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase.[74]\\r\\nIn Czech syntax, adjectives precede nouns.[75] Relative clauses are introduced by relativizers such as the adjective ktery, analogous to the English relative pronouns \\"which\\", \\"that\\", \\"who\\" and \\"whom\\". As with other adjectives, it is declined into the appropriate case (see Declension below) to match its associated noun, person and number. Relative clauses follow the noun they modify, and the following is a glossed example:[76]\\r\\nEnglish: I want to visit the university that John attends.\\r\\nIn Czech, nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases. Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence. A nominativeÿaccusative language, Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case. The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement. The remaining cases (instrumental, locative, vocative and dative) indicate semantic relationships, such as secondary objects, movement or position (dative case) and accompaniment (instrumental case). An adjective's case agrees with that of the noun it describes. When Czech children learn their language's declension patterns, the cases are referred to by number:[77]\\r\\nSome Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently, grouping the nominative and accusative (and the dative and locative) together because those declension patterns are often identical; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages, such as Latin or Russian. This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.[77]\\r\\nSome prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, od (from, away from) and z (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; na means \\"onto\\" or \\"for\\" with the accusative case, but \\"on\\" with the locative.[78]\\r\\nExamples of declension patterns (using prepositions) for a few nouns with adjectives follow. Only one plural example is given, since plural declension patterns are similar across genders.\\r\\nThis is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:\\r\\nEnglish: I carried the box into the house with my friend.\\r\\nCzech distinguishes three gendersmasculine, feminine, and neuterand the masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in -a, -e, or -ost; neuter nouns in -o, -e, or -, and masculine nouns in a consonant.[79] Adjectives agree in gender and animacy (for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural) with the nouns they modify.[80] The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension, but other effects include past-tense verb endings: for example, dlal (he did, or made); dlala (she did, or made) and dlalo (it did, or made).[81]\\r\\nNouns are also inflected for number, distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case. The Czech koruna is an example of this feature; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence, and declined as genitive for numbers five and up.[82]\\r\\nNumerical words decline for case and, for numbers one and two, for gender. Numbers one through five are shown below as examples, and have some of the most exceptions among Czech numbers. The number one has declension patterns identical to those of the demonstrative pronoun, to.[83][84]\\r\\nAlthough Czech's grammatical numbers are singular and plural, several residuals of dual forms remain. Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ruka (hand)ruce (nominative); noha (leg)nohama (instrumental), nohou (genitive/locative); oko (eye)o?i, and ucho (ear)u?i. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs.[85] These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in mezi ?ty?ma o?ima (face to face, lit. among four eyes). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are actually a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, nohy (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.\\r\\nCzech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories. Verbs agree with their subjects in person (first, second or third) and number (singular or plural), and are conjugated for tense (past, present or future). For example, the conjugated verb mluvme (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the infinitive mluvit by its ending, me.[86]\\r\\nTypical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects: perfective and imperfective. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairsfor example, koupit (perfective) and kupovat (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing. This is distinct from past and present tense,[87] and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses.[86] Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.[87]\\r\\nThe verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefixfor example, the imperfective pst (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-.[88] In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodvat.[89] Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jt (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodvat (to go regularly).[90]\\r\\nMany verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of beingbyt (to be), chtt (to want), moct (to be able to), le?et (to lie down, to be lying down)have no perfective form. Conversely, verbs describing immediate states of changefor example, othotnt (to become pregnant) and nadchnout se (to become enthusiastic)have no imperfective aspect.[91]\\r\\nAlthough Czech's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English, the language uses past tense to represent the English present perfect and past perfect; ona b?ela could mean she ran, she has run or she had run.[92]\\r\\nIn some contexts, Czech's perfective present (which differs from the English present perfect) implies future action; in others, it connotes habitual action.[93] As a result, the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity. The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future; instead, the future form of byt (as shown in the table at left) is placed before the infinitive (for example, budu jst\\"I will eat\\").[94]\\r\\nThis conjugation is not followed by byt itself, so future-oriented expressions involving nouns, adjectives, or prepositions (rather than verbs) omit byt. \\"I will be happy\\" is translated as Budu ??astny (not Budu byt ??astny).[94]\\r\\nThe infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, m??u t sly?et\\"I can hear you\\").[95] Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional.[96] The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -?/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural.[97] The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\".[98]\\r\\nMost Czech verbs fall into one of five classes, which determine their conjugation patterns. The future tense of byt would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings. Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below:[99]\\r\\nCzech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet.[100] As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words.[101] The h?ek () is used with certain letters to form new characters: ?, ?, and ?, as well as , , ?, ?, and ? (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (?, an abbreviated h?ek) because of their height.[102] The character ܇ exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia.[103]\\r\\nUnlike most European languages, Czech distinguishes vowel length; long vowels are indicated by an acute accent or, occasionally with ?, a ring. Long u is usually written ~ at the beginning of a word or morpheme (~roda, ne~rodny) and ? elsewhere,[104] except for loanwords (sk~tr) or onomatopoeia (b~).[105] Long vowels and  are not considered separate letters.[106]\\r\\nCzech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most Latin European languages, including English. Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in German (1.). In proper noun phrases (except personal names), only the first word is capitalized (Pra?sky hrad, Prague Castle).[107][108]\\r\\nAccording to Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\\r\\nCzech: V?ichni lid se rod svobodn a sob rovn co do d?stojnosti a prv. Jsou nadni rozumem a svdomm a maj spolu jednat v duchu bratrstv.[109]\\r\\nEnglish: \\"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

The MOT test certificates are currently issued in Great Britain under the auspices of the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) (formed as a result of the merger between the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)), an executive agency of the Department for Transport, and before 1 April 2014 by VOSA. Certificates in Northern Ireland are issued by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA). The test and the pass certificate are often referred to simply as the \\"MOT\\".\\r\\nAbout 20,100[6] local car repair garages throughout Great Britain, employing about 53,000 testers,[6] are authorised to perform testing and to issue certificates. In principle, any individual in Great Britain can apply to run a MOT station, although in order to gain an authorisation from DVSA, both the individual wanting to run the station, as well as the premises, need to meet minimal criteria set out on the government's website within the so-called VT01 form.[7]\\r\\nIn Northern Ireland tests are performed exclusively at the DVA's own test centres, although currently there is an open project investigating bringing Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MOT test was first introduced in 1960 under the direction of the Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples,[8] under powers in the Road Traffic Act 1956. The test was originally a basic test including brakes, lights and steering check which was to be carried out after the vehicle was ten years old and every year thereafter. This became known as the \\"ten year test\\", or alternatively the \\"Ministry of Transport Test\\". The high failure rate resulted in the age that vehicles became due for testing being reduced to seven years on 31 December 1961. In 1962, the first commercial vehicle exam was created and a valid certificate was required in order to receive a tax disc, and in April 1967 the testable age for an MOT was reduced to three years. On 1 January 1983 the testable age for ambulances, taxis and vehicles with more than eight passenger seats, excluding the driver's, was reduced to one year.\\r\\nThe list of items tested has been continually expanded over the years, including in 1968 ÿ a tyre check; 1977 ÿ checks of windscreen wipers and washers, direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 ÿ checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 ÿ a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 ÿ a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 ÿ introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 was the creation of the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 ÿ checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.\\r\\nThe test classes are:\\r\\nAll test stations are required to display a \\"VT9A Fees and Appeals\\" poster on their premises which must be available to the public. As of 6 April 2010, these are the maximum fees that can be charged. They are not subject to VAT.\\r\\nThe actual designation for the pass certificate is VT20, and failure is the VT30, with any advisories being the VT32. The \\"MOT\\" Test will provide an emissions report if applicable.\\r\\nIt is illegal to drive a non-exempt vehicle that requires a test on public roads without a current MOT,[10] except when driving to or from (subject to insurance terms and conditions) a booked MOT Test or to have remedial work done to rectify failures in a previous test.[11] Possession of an up-to-date VT20 test certificate is a pre-requisite for obtaining Vehicle excise duty, and advertisements for used cars frequently say how many months are left to run on the current MOT (i.e., VT20 certificate; although the VT20 points out that it does not, in any way, guarantee road-worthiness at the time of sale). A vehicle could suffer major damage after an MOT has been carried out, but the certificate would still be valid, and obtaining a new one is not required by law (some insurance companies may require a new test, but this is their practice, not law). However, driving a vehicle which is in a dangerous condition on a public road is always illegal, irrespective of its test status.\\r\\nThe official UK MOT inspection manuals[12] are available online.\\r\\nIn Great Britain MOT testing centres are regulated and licensed by the Department and Transport and DVSA for the purpose, and the individual testers carrying out the inspections also have to be trained and certified. The decision to pass or fail each presented vehicle comes down to the discretion of the tester following the guidelines issued by the DVSA.\\r\\nThe MOT test covers the following aspects:\\r\\nThe inspection manual can be found here:[13] The full details must by law be provided on request by all garages licensed to perform MOT tests, and are currently published in DVSA's leaflet The MOT Test and You. An MOT pass certificate indicates that at the time of the test the vehicle met or exceeded the minimum safety standards determined by the DVSA guidelines.\\r\\nAn MOT test certificate confirms that at the time of test, the vehicle has met the minimum acceptable environmental and road safety standards. It does not mean that the vehicle is roadworthy for the life of the certificate. The test does not cover the condition of the engine (other than the emissions), clutch or gearbox. Maintenance that is necessary for the reliable and efficient operation of the vehicle but not its safety forms part of a service inspection that is recommended by manufacturers, but is not a legal requirement for operating the vehicle on the public highway.\\r\\nItems such as the windscreen, wipers and exhaust systems are tested for condition and operation. Windscreen wipers will fail the test if they do not adequately clear the windscreen when used in conjunction with the washers. The exhaust system, in addition to checks on its condition and security, is tested to ascertain whether it is obviously louder than another vehicle of the same make and model with a standard exhaust system fitted. Dismantling of any part of the vehicle during the MOT test is strictly against test regulations, making the assessment of corrosion or worn components in certain areas on certain car models very difficult to determine accurately. As the MOT is only an inspection for road-worthiness at the time of test, the inspection of most accessories is not included. One exception is tow bars: their condition and their attachment to the vehicle is now included in the MOT.\\r\\nA vehicle that has no front- and rear-position lights fitted or has had those lights permanently removed, painted or masked-over is exempt from the lighting sections of the MOT test. An advisory note will be provided on the VT32 as a reminder that the vehicle should only be used during daylight hours and not used at times of seriously reduced visibility.[14]\\r\\nThis is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a \\"Daytime MOT\\", but there is no official distinction. It is The Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations that prevent an unlit vehicle being used on the road after dark, not the MOT.[15]\\r\\nWhen a vehicle fails the MOT test it can be re-tested within the end of 10 working days to gain a pass. There may be a charge payable. If the vehicle remains at the test station for repair after failure then it can have a free partial re-test within 10 working days after the original test has been carried out. If it is removed from the premises for repair and then returned before the end of 10 working days it can have a retest at half the original fee paid. If the failed vehicle is taken away but then brought back to the same test station and retested before the end of the next working day on one or more of the following items only then no fee is charged for a retest:\\r\\nBonnet, horn, sharp edges, boot lid, lamps, steering wheel, brake pedal anti-slip, loading door, tailboard, direction indicators, mirrors, tailgate, doors rear reflectors, VIN, drop sides, registration plates, windscreen and glass, fuel filler cap, seat belts, wipers and washers, hazard warning, seats, wheels and tyres.\\r\\nAfter the 10-day period a full MOT test will have to be carried out. The full MOT test fee is charged again.\\r\\nTest stations and the DVSA's website provide full and up-to-date information regarding MOT re-tests.\\r\\nThe fee for testing and retesting is at the discretion of the proprietor of the test facility, subject to legal maximum prices. The vehicle owner is only subject to one retest per MOT test. If the vehicle fails the MOT retest it is then subject to a full MOT test at the full MOT test fee.\\r\\nMotorists who recently had a vehicle MOT tested and disagree with the outcome of the inspection are entitled to an appeal against the decision. The appeal must be lodged with DVSA/DVA within 28 days of the original test date if the items in question are mechanical in nature, three months are allowed for corrosion issues, except for corrosion of brake discs, brake lines or the exhaust system. Mileage, or the lack thereof, incurred after the inspection has no relevance to the appeal even if the vehicle has not been used for several months after the test.\\r\\nIf the items in question are repaired, replaced or removed from the vehicle, the right of the owner to appeal becomes null and void. Failure because of items easily replaceable, such as tyres or windscreen wiper blades, may not be appealed against, as it cannot be adequately determined if they were the ones fitted at the time of inspection.\\r\\nTo appeal against an MOT pass is free of charge, but appeals against a failure incur a fee whose value would amount to the normal maximum price of an MOT for that vehicle. This fee is then refunded if the appellate inspection finds in favour of the motorist lodging the appeal. If the appellate inspection finds the vehicle was incorrectly diagnosed, DVSA/DVA takes appropriate action against the station involved. This can range from penalty points being issued for minor infringements, to the station's MOT licence being rescinded for more major violations.\\r\\nDVSA/DVA has only the power to discipline the station involved and cannot pursue compensation of any kind for the complainant; that is the responsibility of Trading Standards. An MOT station cannot be held responsible for defects that occur to the vehicle several months after the test was conducted. The appeal process is outlined on the reverse of the VT20 pass certificate and the VT30 failure notice.\\r\\nIt is a common misconception that the MOT inspection provides an irrefutable record of a vehicle's mileage. However, although the mileage is recorded during the test, no part of the inspection requires the test station to verify that this is indeed the actual mileage. It is merely recorded, and any tampering of an odometer would not be discovered as part of the MOT inspection.\\r\\nIn 2012 the MOT test was radically overhauled with many items not previously included in the test now becoming standard.[16]\\r\\nIt also saw the introduction in Great Britain of 'receipt style' plain paper certificates that serve as a notification that a 'pass' entry has been recorded on the DVSA database. The MOT test number contained on the certificate gives access to the vehicle's current test status as well as its test history from 2005 onwards, via the DVSA web site. MOT certificates in Northern Ireland continue to be issued on paper, accompanied by a paper 'certificate disc' which must be displayed on the vehicle. Display of these discs has been mandatory on Northern Ireland tested cars since 2008. However, this was abolished in April 2015.\\r\\nFrom 18 November, the MOT[17] certificate shows the vehicle's recent mileage history. This has been introduced as part of a government initiative to reduce vehicle crime. Where available, the mileage history will comprise the readings associated with the three most recent VT20s (test passes) along with the date of those readings.","input":"How many mot testers are there in the uk?"},{"output":"a tariff to protect and promote American industry","context":"U.S. Senator from Kentucky\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American System was an economic plan that played a prominent role in American policy during the first half of the 19th century. Rooted in the \\"American School\\" ideas of Alexander Hamilton, the plan \\"consisted of three mutually reinforcing parts: a tariff to protect and promote American industry; a national bank to foster commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other 'internal improvements' to develop profitable markets for agriculture\\".[attribution needed][1] Congressman Henry Clay was the plan's foremost proponent and the first to refer to it as the \\"American System\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA plan to strengthen and unify the nation, the American System, was advanced by the Whig Party and a number of leading politicians including Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun and John Quincy Adams. The System ran counter to federalism and included:\\r\\nClay protested that the West, which opposed the tariff, should support it since urban factory workers would be consumers of western foods. In Clays view, the South (which also opposed high tariffs) should support them because of the ready market for cotton in northern mills. This last argument was the weak link. The South never strongly supported the American System and had access to plenty of markets for its cotton exports.\\r\\nPortions of the American System were enacted by the United States Congress. The Second Bank of the United States was rechartered in 1816 for 20 years. High tariffs were first suggested by Alexander Hamilton in his 1791 Report on Manufactures but were not approved by Congress until the Tariff of 1816. Tariffs were subsequently raised until they peaked in 1828 after the so-called Tariff of Abominations. After the Nullification Crisis in 1833, tariffs remained the same rate until the Civil War. However, the national system of internal improvements was never adequately funded; the failure to do so was due in part to sectional jealousies and constitutional squabbles about such expenditures.\\r\\nThe American System did not enjoy universal success, however; in 1830, President Jackson vetoed a bill which would allow the federal government to purchase stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company, which had been organized to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky. Jackson's Maysville Road veto was due to both his personal conflict with Clay and his ideological objections.\\r\\nThe establishment of a protective tariff, a 20%ÿ25% tax on imported goods, would protect a nations business from foreign competition. Congress passed a tariff in 1816 which made European goods more expensive and encouraged consumers to buy relatively cheap American-made goods.\\r\\nThe establishment of a national bank would promote a single currency, making trade easier, and issue what was called sovereign credit, i.e., credit issued by the national government, rather than borrowed from the private banking system. In 1816, Congress created the Second Bank of the United States.\\r\\nThe improvement of the countrys infrastructure, especially transportation systems, made trade easier and faster for everyone. Poor roads made transportation slow and costly.\\r\\nThis program became the leading tenet of the Whig Party of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. It was opposed by the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan prior to the Civil War, often on the grounds that the points of it were unconstitutional.\\r\\nAmong the most important internal improvements created under the American System was the Cumberland Road.\\r\\nHenry Clay's \\"American System,\\" devised in the burst of nationalism that followed the War of 1812, remains one of the most historically significant examples of a government-sponsored program to harmonize and balance the nation's agriculture, commerce, and industry. This \\"System\\" consisted of three mutually reenforcing parts: a tariff to protect and promote American industry; a national bank to foster commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other \\"internal improvements\\" to develop profitable markets for agriculture. Funds for these subsidies would be obtained from tariffs and sales of public lands. Clay argued that a vigorously maintained system of sectional economic interdependence would eliminate the chance of renewed subservience to the free-trade, laissez-faire \\"British System.\\"","input":"What were the major components of clays american system?"},{"output":"The Curse of the Black Pearl","context":"Pirates of the Caribbean is a series of American fantasy swashbuckler films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and based on Walt Disney's theme park ride of the same name.\\r\\nDirectors of the series include Gore Verbinski (1ÿ3), Rob Marshall?(4) and Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg (5). The series is primarily written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1ÿ4); other writers include Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1) and Jeff Nathanson (5). The stories follow the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Characters such as Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) follow Jack, Will and Elizabeth in the course of the films. The fourth film features Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and Angelica (Penlope Cruz), while the fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). The films take place in a fictional historical setting; a world ruled by the British Empire, the East India Trading Company (based on the real East India Company) and the Spanish Empire, with pirates representing freedom from the ruling powers.\\r\\nThe film series started in 2003 with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which received positive reviews from critics and grossed US$654 million worldwide.[1] After the first film's success, Walt Disney Pictures revealed that a trilogy was in the works. The franchise's second film, subtitled Dead Man's Chest, was released three years later in 2006; the sequel proved successful, breaking financial records worldwide the day of its premiere. Dead Man's Chest ended up being the number one film of the year upon earning almost $1.1 billion at the worldwide box office. The third film in the series, subtitled At World's End, followed in 2007, and Disney released a fourth film, subtitled On Stranger Tides, in 2011 in conventional 2D, Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D. On Stranger Tides succeeded in also grossing more than $1 billion,[1] becoming the second film in the franchise and only the eighth film in history to achieve this.\\r\\nThe franchise has grossed over $4.5 billion worldwide;[1] it is the tenth highest-grossing film series of all time and it was the first franchise where more than one film grossed $1 billion worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save Turner's love, Elizabeth Swann, from cursed pirates led by Jack's mutinous former first mate, Captain Barbossa.

Beckett offers clemency if Will agrees to search for Jack's compass in a bid to find the Dead Man's Chest ÿ and inside, the heart of villainous Davy Jones ÿ which would give Beckett control of the seas. However, Jack wants the Chest to escape from an unpaid debt with Jones, who made Jack captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years in exchange for 100 years of service aboard Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman.\\r\\nLord Beckett gains power over Davy Jones and, with the help of the Flying Dutchman, he is now executing his plans to extinguish piracy forever. To stand against the East India Trading Co., Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl set out to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. As one of the Nine Pirate Lords, Jack is needed in order to release an ancient goddess with the power to defeat Beckett's forces.\\r\\nCaptain Jack Sparrow is on a quest to find the fabled Fountain of Youth and crosses paths with a former lover, Angelica. She forces Jack aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the infamous pirate Blackbeard, Angelica's father. Both are also in search of the Fountain; Angelica to save her father's soul, Blackbeard to escape a prophecy of his demise at the hands of a one-legged man. Joining the hunt is former pirate captain Barbossa, now a privateer in King George II's Navy, who is in a race against the Spanish for the Fountain of Youth.\\r\\nGhost Spanish Royal Navy soldiers led by Jack Sparrow's old nemesis, Captain Armando Salazar, escape from the Devil's Triangle, with the goal of killing every pirate at sea, including him. To survive, Jack seeks out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact whose owner can control the seas and break curses.[2]\\r\\nShortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, it was reported that Disney was planning to shoot the fifth and the sixth films back-to-back,[3] although it was later revealed that only the fifth film was in development. On March 4, 2017, director Joachim R?nning stated that Dead Men was only the beginning of the final adventure, implying that it would not be the last film of the franchise and that a sixth film could be realized.[4] The post-credit scene of Dead Men shows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, and Davy Jones, implying that Will and Elizabeth will be main characters again and Davy Jones would be the main antagonist in the sixth film.[5] In September 2017, producer Jerry Bruckheimer indicated that another Pirates sequel is still possible if Dead Men Tell No Tales does well in its home release.[6] In October 2017, Kaya Scodelario said that she was contracted to return for a sixth film.[7] Shortly after, it was announced that Joachim R?nning is being eyed to direct the film.[8]\\r\\nWenches Scarlett (Lauren Maher) and Giselle (Vanessa Branch) fix each other up for their wedding, in which they would each marry their groom. Upon realizing that both their grooms were the same man ÿ Jack Sparrow ÿ the two wenches find themselves in an auction led by the Auctioneer. The short film serves as a prequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl, explaining just why Jack Sparrow's boat, the Jolly Mon, was seen sinking at the beginning of the whole story, and explaining why wenches Scarlett and Giselle were so upset with him, and it also implies how Cotton lost his tongue. The plot took inspiration from the \\"Auction scene\\" from the original ride.\\r\\nThe short was directed by James Ward Byrkit,[9] and was only included as a special feature in the US 15 disc 3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy box set that includes films 1ÿ4; and in the similar UK 5-disc set.\\r\\nIn the early 1990s[10] screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio conceived a supernatural spin on the pirate genre after completing work on Aladdin, but there was no interest from any studio. Undeterred, the writing team refused to give up the dream, waiting for a studio to pick up their take on a pirate tale.[11] Disney had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the Pirates of the Caribbean, which producer Jerry Bruckheimer rejected, feeling it was \\"a straight pirate movie\\".[12] Bruckheimer brought Stuart Beattie in to rewrite the script in March 2002, due to his knowledge of piracy,[13] and later that month Elliott and Rossio were brought in.[12] Elliott and Rossio, inspired by the opening narration of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, decided to give the film a supernatural edge.[14] As the budget rose, Michael Eisner and Robert Iger threatened to cancel the film, though Bruckheimer changed their minds when he showed them concept art and animatics.[15]\\r\\nIn June 2002 Gore Verbinski signed on to direct The Curse of the Black Pearl, and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush signed on the following month to star.[13] Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology to resurrect a genre, one that had disappeared after the Golden Age of Hollywood, and recalled his childhood memories of the ride, feeling the film was an opportunity to pay tribute to the \\"scary and funny\\" tone of it. Depp was attracted to the story as he found it quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa, as he knew he would not play it with attempts at complexity, but with a simple villainy that would suit the story's tone.[16] Orlando Bloom read the script after Rush, with whom he was working on Ned Kelly, suggested it to him.[17] Keira Knightley came as a surprise to Verbinski: he had not seen her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed by her audition.[16] Tom Wilkinson was negotiated with to play Governor Swann,[13] but the role went to Jonathan Pryce, whom Depp idolized.[16]\\r\\nShooting for The Curse of the Black Pearl began on October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003.[13] Before its release, many executives and journalists had expected the film to flop, as the pirate genre had not been successful for years, the film was based on a theme-park ride, and Depp rarely made a big film.[18] However, The Curse of the Black Pearl became both a critical and commercial success.\\r\\nAfter seeing how well the first film was made, the cast and crew signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back,[19] a practical decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew.[20] Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy.[21] They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of the first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device.[22] They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.[23]\\r\\nFilming for the sequels began on February 28, 2005,[24] with Dead Man's Chest finishing on March 1, 2006,[25] and At World's End on January 10, 2007.[26] The second film was also the first Disney theatrical feature film with the computer-generated Walt Disney Pictures logo.[27]\\r\\nRossio and Elliot discovered the novel On Stranger Tides during production of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End and decided to use it as the basis for a fourth film. As Gore Verbinski was unavailable, Bruckheimer invited Rob Marshall to direct the film.[28] Elliott and Rossio decided to do a stand-alone film,[29] with a story that would support new characters,[30] and incorporate elements from the novel, such as Blackbeard, the Fountain of Youth and mermaidsthe latter two having been already alluded to in the previous films.[31] Depp, Rush, Greg Ellis and Kevin McNally returned to their roles,[32] and the cast saw the additions of Ian McShane as Blackbeard and Penlope Cruz as Angelica, Blackbeard's daughter and Jack Sparrow's love interest.[33] A further addition was Richard Griffiths as King George II of Great Britain. After the costly production of two simultaneous films, Disney tried to scale down the fourth installment, giving a lower budget,[34] which led to cheaper locations and fewer scenes with special effects.[35] It was also filmed in 3D, with cameras similar to the ones used in Avatar.[28]\\r\\nFilming for On Stranger Tides began June 14, 2010 and ended on November 19, 2010.[35][36] It was released in the United States on May 20, 2011.[37] With a budget of $378.5 million, On Stranger Tides holds the record for most expensive film ever made.\\r\\nOn January 14, 2011, it was confirmed that Terry Rossio would write the screenplay for the fifth installment, without his co-writer Ted Elliott.[38] On January 11, 2013, Jeff Nathanson signed on to write the script for the film. On May 29, 2013, it was announced that Norwegian directors Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg were selected to direct.[39] On August 22, 2013, the two revealed that the title of the fifth film would be Dead Men Tell No Tales, alluding to the line well-known from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park attractions.[40][41][42] Although, the film was given an alternative title, Salazar's Revenge, in selected European, South American and Asian countries for marketing purposes.[43][44] They also confirmed that they were working on the film, speaking highly of Jeff Nathanson's \\"funny and touching\\" script and that they are inspired by the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl.[45][46] On September 10, 2013, Disney pushed back the film's initial 2015 release,[47] with sources indicating that a Summer 2016 release is likely.[48] Producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that script issues were behind the delay, and that Jeff Nathanson was at work on a second attempt based on a well-received outline.[49] While Disney originally announced a release on July 7, 2017,[50][51] Dead Men Tell No Tales was released on May 26, 2017.[52]\\r\\nA spokesman for the Australian Arts Minister confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.[53] According to Australian film industry sources, pre-production started in late September 2014 with filming expected to commence in February 2015.[54] This was officially confirmed by Disney and Ian Walker the Queensland Arts Minister on October 2, 2014, stating that filming will take place exclusively in Australia, being the largest production to ever shoot in the country. Village Roadshow Studios and Port Douglas were officially confirmed as filming locations.[55] Production began in Australia on February 17, 2015 and wrapped on July 9, 2015.[56]\\r\\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean film series was successful at the box office, with each film grossing over $650?million, and all but Dead Men Tell No Tales at some point ranking among the fifty highest-grossing films of all time. It also became the first ever series to have multiple films passing the billion dollar mark in box office revenues with Dead Man's Chest and On Stranger Tides,[109] which is followed by other series, such as the Batman series, J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth series, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Transformers series, Jurassic Park series, Star Wars series and The Fast and the Furious series.\\r\\nThe Curse of the Black Pearl was the third highest-grossing 2003 film in North America (behind The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Finding Nemo) and fourth worldwide (behind The Return of the King, Finding Nemo and The Matrix Reloaded).[110] Dead Man's Chest was the most successful film of 2006 worldwide,[111] and At World's End led the worldwide grosses in 2007, though being only fourth in North America (behind Spider-Man 3, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Shrek the Third).[112] On Stranger Tides was the third highest-grossing film of 2011 worldwide (behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon) and the fifth in North America.[113] The first three sequels broke box office records upon release, of which the most notable are the opening-weekend record in North America (Dead Man's Chest),[114] the Memorial-Day weekend record in North America (At World's End)[115] and the opening-weekend record outside North America (On Stranger Tides).[116]\\r\\nThe series is noted for its high quality of acting talent, and is one of the aspects of the films that is always praised.[128][129][130][131][132][133] The visual and practical effects are considered some of the best ever done on film,[132][133][134][135] so much so that audiences believed certain CGI elements of the films were real and done practically.[136][137][138][139] However, the plots of the four sequels have received mixed reviews, with the general consensus that they are too bloated and convoluted to follow.[140][141][142][143][144] Pirates of the Caribbean is noted for reinvigorating the pirate genre of film after decades of either no pirate films or failed pirate films.[145] The success of the series saw Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer try to replicate the franchise's success by launching films such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and The Lone Ranger, the latter of which directed by Gore Verbinski. Both movies failed critically and commercially.[146][147][148][149]\\r\\nTogether, all the first three films were nominated for a total of 11 Academy Awards, of which a single award was won.\\r\\nTogether, all the four films were nominated for a total of 2 Golden Globe Awards, of which neither were won.\\r\\nTogether, all the first three films were nominated for a total of 13 MTV Movie Awards, of which 4 were won.\\r\\nTogether, the first four films were nominated for a total of 25 Teen Choice Awards, of which 16 were won.","input":"What is first pirates of the caribbean movie?"},{"output":"North Carolina","context":"","input":"What team did michael jordan play for in college?"},{"output":"Nimitz-class","context":"The Nimitz-class supercarriers are a class of ten nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in service with the United States Navy. The lead ship of the class is named after World War II United States Pacific Fleet commander Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,who was the U.S. Navy's last surviving fleet admiral. With an overall length of 1,092?ft (333?m) and full-load displacement of over 100,000 long tons,[1] they have been the largest warships built and in service.[4]\\r\\nInstead of the gas turbines or diesel-electric systems used for propulsion on many modern warships, the carriers use two A4W pressurized water reactors which drive four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots (56?km/h) and maximum power of around 260,000?shp (190?MW). As a result of the use of nuclear power, the ships are capable of operating for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years. They are categorized as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and are numbered with consecutive hull numbers between CVN-68 and CVN-77.[Note 1]\\r\\nAll ten carriers were constructed by Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia. USS?Nimitz, the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on 3 May 1975, and USS?George H.W. Bush, the tenth and last of the class, was commissioned on 10 January 2009. Since the 1970s, Nimitz-class carriers have participated in many conflicts and operations across the world, including Operation Eagle Claw in Iran, the Gulf War, and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\r\\nThe angled flight decks of the carriers use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft, with steam catapults and arrestor wires for launch and recovery. As well as speeding up flight deck operations, this allows for a much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers. An embarked carrier air wing consisting of up to around 90 aircraft is normally deployed on board.[citation needed] After the retirement of the F-14 Tomcat, the air wings' strike fighters are primarily F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets and F/A-18A+ and F/A-18C Hornets. In addition to their aircraft, the vessels carry short-range defensive weaponry for anti-aircraft warfare and missile defense.\\r\\nThe unit cost is about $8.5 billion in FY 12 dollars[5] US$8.86 billion (2016) inflation adjusted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nimitz-class carriers have an overall length of 1,092?ft (333?m) and a full-load displacement of about 100,000ÿ104,000 long tons (102,000ÿ106,000?t).[6] They have a beam at the waterline of 135?ft (41?m), and the maximum width of their flight decks is 251?feet 10?inches (76.76?m) to 257?feet 3?inches (78.41?m) (depending on the variant). The ship's company can number up to 3,200, not including an air wing of 2,480.[7]\\r\\nThe Nimitz-class aircraft carriers were ordered to supplement the aircraft carriers of the Kitty Hawk class and Enterprise class, maintaining the strength and capability of the U.S. Navy after the older carriers were decommissioned.[8] The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. aircraft carriers, in particular the Enterprise and Forrestal-class supercarriers, although the arrangement of the ships is relatively similar to that of the Kitty Hawk class.[9] Among other design improvements, the two reactors on Nimitz-class carriers take up less space than the eight reactors used on Enterprise. Along with a more generally improved design, this means that Nimitz-class carriers can carry 90% more aviation fuel and 50% more ordnance when compared to the Forrestal class.\\r\\nThe U.S. Navy has stated that the carriers could withstand three times the damage sustained by the Essex class inflicted by Japanese air attacks during World War II.[3] The hangars on the ships are divided into three fire bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire. This addition has been present on U.S. aircraft carriers since World War II, after the fires caused by Kamikaze attacks.[10]\\r\\nThe first ships were designed around the time of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.[11]\\r\\nA major purpose of the ships was initially to support the U.S. military during the Cold War, and they were designed with capabilities for that role, including using nuclear power instead of oil for greater endurance when deployed in blue water, and the ability to make adjustments to the carriers' weapons systems on the basis of new intelligence and technological developments.[12] They were initially categorized only as attack carriers, but ships have been constructed with anti-submarine capabilities since USS?Carl Vinson.[13][14] As a result, the ships and their aircraft are now able to participate in a wide range of operations, which can include sea and air blockades, mine laying, and missile strikes on land, air and sea.[15]\\r\\nBecause of a design flaw, ships of this class have inherent lists to starboard when under combat loads that exceed the capability of their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent on some of the more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.[6][16]\\r\\nAll ten Nimitz-class aircraft carriers were constructed between 1968 and 2006 at Newport News Shipbuilding Company, in Newport News, Virginia, in the largest drydock in the western hemisphere, dry dock 12, now 2,172 feet (662?m) long after a recent expansion.\\r\\nSince USS?Theodore Roosevelt, the aircraft carriers were manufactured in modular construction. This means that whole sections could be welded together with plumbing and electrical equipment already fitted, improving efficiency. Using gantry cranes, the modules were lifted into the dry dock and welded. In the case of the bow section, these can weigh over 1,500,000 pounds (680?t).[17][18][19] This method was originally developed by Ingalls Shipbuilding and increases the rate of work because much of the fitting out does not have to be carried out within the confines of the already finished hull.[20]\\r\\nThe total cost of construction for each ship was around $4.5 billion.[Note 2][8]\\r\\nAll ships of the class are powered by two A4W nuclear reactors, housed in separate compartments. They power four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots (56?km/h) and maximum power of 260,000?bhp (190?MW).[3] The reactors produce heat through nuclear fission which heats water. This is then passed through four turbines which are shared by the two reactors. The turbines power the four bronze propellers, each with a diameter of 25 feet (7.6?m) and a weight of 66,000 pounds (30?t). Behind these are the two rudders which are 29 feet (8.8?m) high and 22 feet (6.7?m) long, and each weigh 110,000 pounds (50 metric tons).[21]\\r\\nThe Nimitz-class ships constructed since USS?Ronald Reagan also have bulbous bows in order to improve speed and fuel efficiency by reducing wave-making resistance.[22] As a result of the use of nuclear power, the ships are capable of operating continuously for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years.[21]\\r\\nIn addition to the aircraft carried on board, the ships carry defensive equipment for use against missiles and hostile aircraft. These consist of either three or four NATO RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile launchers designed for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as either three or four 20?mm Phalanx CIWS missile defense cannon.\\r\\nUSS?Ronald Reagan has none of these, having been built with the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile system, two of which have also been installed on USS?Nimitz and USS?George Washington. These will be installed on the other ships as they return for Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH).[3][16] Since USS Theodore Roosevelt, the carriers have been constructed with 2.5?in (64?mm) Kevlar armor over vital spaces, and earlier ships have been retrofitted with it: Nimitz in 1983ÿ1984, Eisenhower from 1985ÿ1987 and Vinson in 1989.[2][23]\\r\\nThe other countermeasures the ships use are four Sippican SRBOC (super rapid bloom off-board chaff) six-barrel MK36 decoy launchers, which deploy infrared Flare (countermeasure) and chaff to disrupt the sensors of incoming missiles; an SSTDS torpedo defense system; and an AN/SLQ-25 Nixie torpedo countermeasures system. The carriers also use AN/SLQ-32(V) Radar jamming and deception systems to detect and disrupt hostile radar signals in addition to the electronic warfare capabilities of some of the aircraft on board.[24][25]\\r\\nThe presence of nuclear weapons on board U.S. aircraft carriers since the end of the Cold War has neither been confirmed nor denied by the U.S. government. As a result of this, the presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier in a foreign port has occasionally provoked protest from local people, for example when USS Nimitz docked in Chennai, India, in 2007. At that time, the Strike Group commander Rear Admiral John Terence Blake stated that: \\"The U.S. policy is that we do not routinely deploy nuclear weapons on board Nimitz.\\"[26][27]\\r\\nIn May 2013, George H.W. Bush conducted the first carrier-borne end-to-end at-sea test of the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense System (SSTDS). The SSTDS combines the passive detection of the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) that finds, classifies, and tracks torpedoes with the hard-kill capability of a Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT), an encapsulated miniature torpedo designed to locate, home in on, and destroy hostile torpedoes.[28] This increases protection against wake-homing torpedoes like the Type 53 that don't respond to acoustic decoys. The pieces of the SSTDS are engineered to locate and destroy incoming torpedoes in a matter of seconds. Each system includes one TWS and 8 CATs. Initial operational capability (IOC) is planned for 2019 and all aircraft carriers are to be outfitted by 2035.[29][30][31]\\r\\nIn order for a carrier to deploy, it must embark one of ten Carrier Air Wings (CVW).[Note 3] The carriers can accommodate a maximum of 130 F/A-18 Hornets[32] or 85ÿ90 aircraft of different types, but current numbers are typically 64 aircraft. Although the air wings are integrated with the operation of the carriers they are deployed to, they are nevertheless regarded as a separate entity. As well as the aircrew, the air wings are also made up of support personnel involved in roles including maintenance, aircraft and ordnance handling and emergency procedures. Each person on the flight deck wears color-coded clothing to make his role easily identifiable.\\r\\nA typical carrier air wing can include 24ÿ36 F/A-18E or F Super Hornets as strike fighters; two squadrons of 10ÿ12 F/A-18C Hornets, with one of these often provided by the U.S. Marine Corps (VMFA), also as strike fighters; 4ÿ6 EA-18G Growlers for electronic warfare; 4ÿ6 E-2C or D Hawkeyes for airborne early warning (AEW), C-2 Greyhounds used for logistics (to be replaced by MV-22 Ospreys); and a Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron of 6ÿ8 SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawks. Aircraft that have previously operated from Nimitz-class carriers include F-4 Phantoms, RA-5C Vigilantes, RF-8G Crusaders, F-14 Tomcats, S-3 Vikings, EA-6B Prowlers, A-7 Corsair II and A-6E Intruder aircraft.[33]\\r\\nThe flight deck is angled at nine degrees, which allows for aircraft to be launched and recovered simultaneously. This angle of the flight deck was reduced slightly in relation to previous carriers, as the current design improves the air flow around the carrier.[11] Four steam catapults are used to launch fixed-wing aircraft, and four arrestor wires are used for recovery. The two newest carriers, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, have only three arrestor wires each, as the fourth was used infrequently on earlier ships and was therefore deemed unnecessary.[10]\\r\\nThis CATOBAR arrangement allows for faster launching and recovery as well as a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or arrestor wires. The ship's aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.[10]\\r\\nWhen an aircraft carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a last line of defense against enemy missiles and aircraft. An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.[34]\\r\\nAs a result of its target value and vulnerability, aircraft carriers are always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, in addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates (since retired from USN service), guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support.[35] The precise structure and numbers of each type of ship can vary between groups depending on the objectives of the deployment.[36]\\r\\nWhile the designs of the final seven ships (beginning with USS?Theodore Roosevelt) are slightly different from those of the earlier ships, the U.S. Navy considers all ten carriers as a single class.[37] When the older carriers come in for Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), their nuclear power plants are refueled and they are upgraded to the standards of the later carriers. Other modifications may be performed to update the ships' equipment.[16][38]\\r\\nThe ships were initially classified only as attack carriers but have been constructed with anti-submarine capabilities since USS Carl Vinson. These improvements include better radar systems and facilities which enable the ships to operate aircraft in a more effective Anti-submarine warfare role, including the fitting of common undersea picture (CUP) technology which uses sonar to allow for better assessment of the threat from submarines.[13] The changes included better support for S-3 Viking ASW patrol planes and SH-60F Seahawk helicopters with dipping sonar systems.\\r\\nUSS Theodore Roosevelt and later carriers have slight structural differences from the earlier Nimitz carriers such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on USS George Washington, and the high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with USS John C. Stennis.[9][39] More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.[40][41]\\r\\nThe final carrier of the class, USS George H.W. Bush, was designed as a \\"transition ship\\" from the Nimitz class to the replacement Gerald R. Ford?class. Bush incorporates new technologies including improved propeller and bulbous bow designs, a reduced Radar cross-section and electronic and environmental upgrades.[42][43], the ship's cost was $6.2?billion. The earlier Nimitz-class ships each cost around $4.5 billion.[44] To lower costs, some new technologies and design features were also incorporated into USS?Ronald Reagan, the previous carrier, including a redesigned island.[45]\\r\\nThe United States Navy lists the following ten ships in the Nimitz class:[37]\\r\\nOne of the first major operations in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean in response to the taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran.[15] Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet,[59] Eisenhower relieved Nimitz in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea.[46] Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in what became known as the Gulf of Sidra incident.[60] In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the Bering Sea,[61] and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.[62]\\r\\nThe two most significant deployments the Nimitz class was involved in during the 1990s were the Gulf War and its aftermath, and Operation Southern Watch in southern Iraq. All active vessels were engaged in both of these to some extent, with Operation Southern Watch continuing until 2003.[63] Most carriers in operation in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm played supporting roles, with only Roosevelt playing an active part in combat operations.\\r\\nThroughout the 1990s and more recently, Nimitz-class carriers have been deployed as part of humanitarian missions. While deployed in the Gulf War, Lincoln was diverted to the Pacific Ocean to participate alongside 22 other ships in Operation Fiery Vigil, evacuating civilians following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on Luzon Island in the Philippines. In October 1993, Lincoln deployed to Somalia to assist UN humanitarian operations there, spending four weeks flying patrols over the area around Mogadishu while supporting U.S. troops during Operation Restore Hope. The same ship also participated in Operation Vigilant Sentinel in the Persian Gulf in 1995.[53]\\r\\nRoosevelt flew patrols in support of the Kurds over northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort in 1991. In 1996, George Washington played a peacekeeping role in Operation Decisive Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[64] In 1999, Roosevelt was called to the Ionian Sea to support Operation Allied Force alongside other NATO militaries.[65]\\r\\nHarry S. Truman's maiden deployment was in November 2000. The carrier's air wing flew 869 combat sorties in support of Operation Southern Watch, including a strike on Iraqi air defense sites on 16 February 2001, in response to Iraqi surface-to-air missile fire against United Nations coalition forces.[66]\\r\\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Carl Vinson and Theodore Roosevelt were among the first warships to participate in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Carl Vinson sailed towards the Persian Gulf intending to support Operation Southern Watch in July 2001. This changed in response to the attacks, and the ship changed course to travel towards the North Arabian Sea, where she launched the first airstrikes in support of the operation on 7 October 2001.[67]\\r\\nFollowing the attacks, John C. Stennis and George Washington participated in Operation Noble Eagle, carrying out homeland security operations off the West Coast of the United States. All active ships have been involved to some extent in Iraq and Afghanistan since that time. This included the invasion in 2003, as well as providing subsequent support for Operation Iraqi Freedom since then.[68]\\r\\nThe carriers have also provided aid after natural disasters. In 2005, Abraham Lincoln supported Operation Unified Assistance in Indonesia after the December 2004 tsunami,[69] and Truman provided aid after Hurricane Katrina later in 2005.[70] The Reagan Carrier Strike Group performed humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in the Philippines in June 2008 after Typhoon Fengshen, which killed hundreds from the central island regions and the main island of Luzon.[71] In January 2010 Vinson operated off Haiti, providing aid and drinking water to earthquake survivors as part of the U.S. led Operation Unified Response, alongside other major warships and hospital ship Comfort.[72]\\r\\nIn order to refuel their nuclear power plants, the carriers each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This is also the most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009ÿ2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion.[73][74][75][76] Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the nuclear power plants.[77]\\r\\nBecause of their status as the largest warships in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not just in terms of a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers,[78] or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999,[79] or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.[80][81]\\r\\nAs on most large warships, there have been several incidents involving the death or injury of one or more crew members, although most have involved freak accidents or failures, such as a man overboard as a result of poor weather. One of the highest-profile incidents was on 26 May 1981, when an EA-6B Prowler crashed on the flight deck of Nimitz, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others.[15][82] Forensic testing of the personnel involved showed that several tested positive for marijuana. While this in itself was not found to have directly caused the crash, the findings of the investigation prompted the introduction of mandatory drug testing of all service personnel.[83][84]\\r\\nIn cases of ditched aircraft, pilots have been able to eject safely in several cases. However, fatal aircraft crashes have occurred; in 1994, Lt. Kara Hultgreen, the first female F-14 Tomcat pilot, was killed while attempting to land on board Abraham Lincoln during a training exercise.[53]\\r\\nFires have also caused damage to the ships; in May 2008, while rotating through to her new homeport at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan, George Washington suffered a serious fire which cost $70?million in repairs, injured 37 sailors and led to the ship undergoing three months of repairs at San Diego; this led to its having to miss the 2008 RIMPAC exercises and delayed the final withdrawal from service of USS?Kitty Hawk. The fire was caused by unauthorized smoking in an area near improperly stored flammable refrigerant compressor oil.[85][86][87]\\r\\nNimitz-class carriers were designed to have a 50-year service life.[88] At the end of the service life, ships will be decommissioned. This process will first take place on Nimitz and is estimated to cost from $750 to $900?million. This compares with an estimate of $53?million for a conventionally powered carrier. Most of the difference in cost is attributed to the deactivation of the nuclear power plants and safe removal of radioactive material and other contaminated equipment.[89]\\r\\nA new class of carriers, the Gerald R. Ford class, is being constructed to replace previous vessels after decommissioning. Ten of these are expected, and the first has entered service as of 22 July 2017 to replace Enterprise. Most of the rest of these new carriers are to replace the oldest Nimitz ships as they reach the end of their service lives.[90] The new carriers will have a similar design to George H.W. Bush (using an almost identical hull shape) and technological and structural improvements.[91]","input":"What is the biggest aircraft carrier in the us?"},{"output":"The African Queen","context":"","input":"With what movie did humphrey bogart win his only oscar?"},{"output":"November 13, 2008","context":"World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King is the second expansion set for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft, following The Burning Crusade. It was released on November 13, 2008 and sold 2.8 million copies within the first day, which at that time was fastest selling computer game of all time. The game added a substantial amount of new content into the game world, including the new continent of Northrend, home of the eponymous Lich King and his undead minions. In order to advance through Northrend, players are required to reach at least level 68 and the level cap for the expansion is 80. The first hero class was introduced, the Death Knight, that starts at level 55.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first expansion pack, World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, raised the maximum level from 60 to 70 and the Wrath of the Lich King raised the level cap from 70 to 80.[4]\\r\\nThe death knight is the first \\"hero class\\" introduced in World of Warcraft, and would be the only one available until the introduction of the demon hunter in Legion. Hero classes are those that start the game at a higher level than the regular level 1. Originally, a death knight could only be created if the player previously had a level 55 on that realm but that requirement was removed in late 2014.[5]\\r\\nDeath knights are fallen heroes of the Alliance and the Horde, raised by the Lich King to serve as champions of the undead Scourge. They are able to fill the tank and damage dealer roles. The three death knight specializations are blood, frost and unholy. The blood specialization focuses on the manipulation of blood, using an enemy's blood against them while using the death knights' blood to benefit themselves. Frost specializes in control, counters and combination strikes using frost related abilities. Unholy specialization focuses on poisoning your opponent and sending the player's permanent, controllable pet ghoul to attack the enemy.[6][7] Death knights wear plate armor and wield weapons with rune engravings (permanent weapon enhancements), which are achieved through the death knight profession called runeforging by utilizing the runeforge in Acherus.\\r\\nNewly created death knights begin with a larger set of spells and abilities than new characters of other classes. The class starts without any talent points and must unlock available talent tiers for their level by completing quests in the death knight starting area in Eastern Plaguelands.[8] Players must complete all the starting area quests in order to join the rest of Azeroth. The death knight class is available to all in-game races except the Pandarens.\\r\\nInstead of utilizing rage, energy or mana for combat resources, a death knight uses a system of runes and runic power (both displayed under the player portrait), which is generated by using runes.[9] The death knight originally had two of each type of rune - blood, frost and unholy - available for use. After a rune is used, it enters a ten-second 'cooldown' period before it can be used again and runic power decays over time when out of combat. With specific talents, the death knight can also turn their runes into death runes, which can be used as any type of rune. The death knight has the option of three presences: blood, frost and unholy. In Wrath of the Lich King, frost presence increased threat generated, increased health and lowered damage taken; blood presence increased damage done and restored a portion of damage dealt as healing; unholy presence increased attack speed, increased movement speed and reduced the global cooldown on all abilities.[7]\\r\\nIn the following expansion, Cataclysm, with a desire to clearly designate specializations as damage dealing or tank, Blood became the designated tanking spec and blood presence's effects was changed so that blood presence had threat and damage mitigation and frost presence was changed to increasing all runic power generation. In the Legion expansion, death knights have six death runes instead of three types of runes and presences were removed; each specific presence's effect is included in its related specialization automatically.[10]\\r\\nNorthrend is a crescent-shaped continent in northern Azeroth.[11] The continent is roughly half the size of the Eastern Kingdoms, but matches Outland in length and width. Although Northrend is known for its snow and ice, only parts of the continent are frozen over.[12] Northrend features eight zones with content designed for players beginning at level 68, although players may travel to Northrend at any level.[13] Players arrive by boat (Alliance) or zeppelin (Horde) either at the Howling Fjord or the Borean Tundra zones, each located at opposite ends of the continent. Howling Fjord is home to evil half-giants called the Vrykul, who reside in Utgarde Keep, the first dungeon in the expansion. The Dragonblight and Grizzly Hills zones are located in the southcentral and southeast parts of the continent respectively. The Ursine Furbolgs reside in the forested Grizzly Hills. Dragonblight features the gravesites of dragons who came to the region to die.[14] Wintergrasp is the first zone in World of Warcraft designed specifically for Player versus Player (PVP) activities, even on Player versus Environment (PvE) servers.[15]\\r\\nThe forces of the Alliance, unified under King Varian Wrynn, have brought its armies to Northrend with the goal of avenging the Alliance Kingdom of Lordaeron, whose betrayal and destruction at the hands of Prince Arthas Menethil was engineered by the Lich King. The Alliance controls Valiance Keep and Valgarde in the Borean Tundra and Howling Fjord respectively, as well as Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.\\r\\nThe Forsaken and their Banshee Queen, Sylvanas Windrunner, have also arrived with a new contagion that they hope will prove to be effective against the undead minions of the Lich King. The Forsaken are seeking vengeance for being subjected to Arthas's magic. They have set up a military base of operations called \\"Vengeance Landing\\" and have created a settlement called \\"New Agamand,\\" both in the Howling Fjord. The magi of Dalaran have also relocated, along with their city, to Northrend in order to deal with the rising threat of the Blue Dragonflight, led by Malygos the Spell-Weaver, and the Lich King. The city of Dalaran functions as the neutral sanctuary city for the continent, analogous to Shattrath City in Outland. Dalaran is levitating at a great height above the Crystalsong Forest zone but can be accessed by either the ground or by flying mount.[14] The expansion also features more creatures and other enemies, such as the four new spirit beasts: Loque'nahak, Gondria, Skoll and Arcturis. It also introduces the vicious dragons called Proto-Drakes (dragons with short arms, huge teeth and large wings) and the gigantic dinosaur named King Krush, who stalks the jungles of Sholazar Basin. Arthas Menethil, the Lich King, is the primary antagonist of the expansion.\\r\\nIn the wake of the Sunwell's purification, a period of suspicious silence swept over the world. As if on cue, the undead Scourge launched a massive assault against the cities and towns of Azeroth, this time extending its reach far beyond the Eastern Kingdoms. Under pressure to respond with a full army, Warchief Thrall deployed an expedition force to Northrend led by Overlord Garrosh Hellscream. Meanwhile, the missing human king Varian Wrynn at last returned to Stormwind City and reclaimed his crown. He sent an equally powerful Alliance army, commanded by Bolvar Fordragon, to defeat the Lich Kingand any Horde forces who would stand in their way.\\r\\nThe Alliance and Horde (led by Dranosh Saurfang) eventually led a combined offensive on the Wrathgate, the entrance to the Lich King's fortress of Icecrown Citadel. Before they could succeed however, Grand Apothecary Putress and his Royal Apothecary Society followers (renegade Forsaken) unleashed a new plague that killed friend and foe alike, while his traitorous counterpart, the dreadlord Varimathras, seized the Undercity in a coup that nearly killed Sylvanas. The usurpers were slain for their vile deeds by armies of the Alliance and Horde and the Forsaken capital was restored. The debacle however, created suspicion among the Horde regarding Sylvanas's loyalties. At the Wrathgate, many brave Alliance soldiers died at the hands of the Forsaken's Royal Apothecary Society; including King Varian's dear friend Bolvar Fordragon. Varian, who had always been wary of the orcs, discovered that the Royal Apothecary Society had been developing the new plague for years. The events that transpired during the battle for the Undercity convinced the human king that the Horde had been left unchecked for too long and he becomes hostile to the Horde for the rest of the campaign in Northrend.\\r\\nThe march of Horde and Alliance armies through Northrend led to a number of victories, but these successes paled before a discovery made by the explorer Brann Bronzebeard within the ancient titan complex of Ulduar. This mysterious fortress had long served as the prison of the Old God Yogg-Saron, a being of unfathomable evil whose influence had spread into the continent of Northrend itself. However, the safeguards keeping Yogg-Saron imprisoned have begun to fail, and the Old God's influence has already corrupted Ulduar's guardians. With Brann's assistance, small bands of Alliance and Horde champions infiltrated Ulduar to confront Yogg-Saron, who blasted the invaders with cryptic visions: the millennia-old creation of an artifact known as the Dragon Soul, the assassination of Stormwind's King Llane, and a glimpse of the Lich King's future. However, the heroes manage to prevail and destroy Yogg-Saron.\\r\\nIn preparation for the final offensive against the Lich King, the Argent Crusade (a union of holy warriors from the Order of the Silver Hand and the Argent Dawn) assembled a base near Icecrown Citadel to gather resources and identify the champions who would serve at the vanguard of their army. Highlord Tirion Fordring organized a tournament to test potential heroes of the Horde and the Alliance, but agents of the Scourge quickly emerged to sabotage the event. The undead attack culminated with the appearance of the monstrous crypt lord Anub'arak, who attempted to exterminate Tirion's elite force before it could be assembled. Fortunately, the gathered heroes prove to be too much for Anub'arak to handle and he is defeated.\\r\\nAs the final battle against the Lich King approached, the human sorceress Jaina Proudmoore and the Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner journeyed to the icy heart of Northrend. Both had come for different reasons: Jaina hoped to discover whether a part of her former friend and lover, Arthas Menethil, still lived; Sylvanas longed to take revenge on her old enemy. With the aid of these two heroes, Azeroth's champions stormed Icecrown Citadel and vanquished the Lich King's minions. Their confrontation with the Lich King involved thousands of souls consumed by Arthas's blade, Frostmourne. Ultimately, Arthas was slain with the aid of Tirion Fordring, and the heroes who triumphed over him learned a chilling truth about the existence of the undead Scourge. Without a Lich King, the leaderless undead would go on an unstoppable rampage across Azeroth. Bolvar (revealed to have been altered by the red dragons' flame), steps forward and voluntarily becomes the new Lich King, promising to keep the keep the Scourge contained in Northrend as its eternal jailer.\\r\\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King was announced on August 3, 2007, on the first day of BlizzCon 2007.[16][17] Several enhancements to World of Warcraft's graphics engine were added with the release of Wrath of the Lich King. These include the use of a new shader in areas containing ice,[18] new fire effects, more realistic shadows, and the option to turn down character texture resolution to improve performance.\\r\\nOn October 15, 2008, Patch 3.0.2, titled 'Wrath of the Lich King', was released to pave the way for the upcoming expansion, bringing many of the expansion's updated systems to the game pre-release.[19] Several new features were added including an all new class called the Death Knight. Classes received new spells and abilities. A harbor was added to Stormwind and new Zeppelin towers outside Orgrimmar and Tirisfal Glades. Wrath of the Lich King was released on November 13, 2008.\\r\\nPatch 3.1.0, 'Secrets of Ulduar', was released April 15, 2009.[20] Players discovered the titan city of Ulduar to learn it was a prison keeping the Old God of Death, Yogg-Saron inside. New content along with the new raid, Ulduar, was added including the new Argent Tournament Grounds. The dual talent specialization and the equipment manager were added to the UI. Patch 3.2, 'Call of the Crusade', was released August 5, 2009.[21] Since release of Argent Tournament in patch 3.1.0, players have been fighting champions of each faction. Patch 3.2.0 added the Crusader's Coliseum raid, a PvP season 7, a new Battleground, Isle of Conquest and some Argent Tournament quests. The final major patch for the expansion, Patch 3.3, 'Fall of the Lich King', was released on December 9, 2009.[22] It added the Icecrown Citadel raid, where players would fight the Lich King and the main storyline came to a conclusion. Other new content included the Kaluak Fishing Derby. Cross server LFG (looking for group), which allowed players from different servers to play together in a dungeon. Patch 3.3.5, released on June 22, 2010, was a minor content patch that released the Ruby Sanctum raid and added cross-game chat using Battle.net. The raid features fighting against the black dragonflight that is attempting to destroy the Sanctum to facilitate Deathwing's reemergence.\\r\\nOn September 19, 2012, the Wrath of the Lich King expansion was completely merged with the original World of Warcraft game, just as the Burning Crusade expansion was the previous year. Now all players who purchase the original game automatically receive The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King at no additional cost. This merging of the expansions with the original game is called a \\"Battle Chest\\".[23]\\r\\nWrath of the Lich King was critically acclaimed, scoring a 91 on Metacritic.[36] Since its release, this expansion has often been recognized as World of Warcraft's best expansion by critics and fans.[37] The game reached its peak in October 2010 with over 12 million subscribers.[38]\\r\\nThe set sold 2.8 million copies within the first 24 hours of availability.[39] This had made it the fastest selling computer game of all time, beating the record set by the previous World of Warcraft expansion The Burning Crusade, which had sold 2.4 million within its first 24 hours.[40] It received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA),[41] indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.[42] It later lost its rank as number one after Blizzard released Diablo III, which sold over 3.5 million copies within its first 24 hours on the market.[43]","input":"When did wrath of the lich king release?"},{"output":"Eurasia","context":"","input":"What region of the world is russia in?"},{"output":"18 years old","context":"Gun laws in Indiana regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition in the U.S. state of Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of July 1, 2017, persons who a) are at least 18 years old, b) are protected by a protection order, c) have applied for a license, and d) are not prohibited from possessing a handgun may carry a handgun without a license for 60 days from the date of the protection order being issued.[1]\\r\\nOn May 9, 2017, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that detaining an individual based solely upon their possession of a handgun (in order to verify that they are licensed) violates the Fourth Amendment absent any other reasonable articulable suspicion of a crime being committed.[2]\\r\\nLocal laws regulating the possession and ownership of ammunition, firearms and shooting accessories are prohibited per IC 35ÿ47ÿ11.1ÿ2, subject to the exemptions listed in IC 35ÿ47ÿ11.1ÿ4.

Edward Roush Lake, Mississinewa Lake, Monroe Lake, Patoka Lake, and Salamonie Lake is restricted according to CFR Title 36, Chapter 111, Part 327.[10]\\r\\nPrivate businesses may restrict or forbid firearms on their properties. However, a 2010 law prohibits employers from discharging employees for in-vehicle firearms possession on business property.[11] Furthermore, an employer may not ask any employee about the possession of firearms and/or ammunition.[12]\\r\\nFirearms dealers or private individuals may not sell any firearm to someone less than 18 years old, or less than 23 years old if the buyer was \\"adjudicated a delinquent child for an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult\\", or to a person who is mentally incompetent or is a drug or alcohol abuser.[citation needed]\\r\\nAll NFA-regulated weapons and devices are legal in Indiana.\\r\\nIndiana honors all other states handgun licenses, though not all other states honor Indiana's license.[13] Because there is no obligation for one state to notify another state of any change in their gun laws the Indiana State Police does not attempt to track this information. An Illinois Firearms Owners Identification (FOID) card allows Illinois residents to purchase and possess firearms and ammunition. The FOID is not a permit to carry a handgun, therefore it is not honored as such by Indiana,[14] but the Illinois license to carry a concealed firearm, first issued in February 2014, is honored like that of any other state.\\r\\nThe following states have established arrangements where they recognize or honor permits or licenses issued by the State of Indiana: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.[15]\\r\\nIn January 2013, the Indiana State Police Firearms Section began publishing quarterly reports that show the number of active handgun licenses held by Indiana residents. As of December 31, 2015, there were 661,334 active licenses to carry firearms issued by Indiana, with 23.8% being issued to females. In 2015, 5.4% of all applicants were rejected for various reasons, 15.5% of rejected applicants being female.[16]\\r\\nBoth Indiana and Federal laws restrict purchase and possession under certain circumstances. Federal law prohibits possession of firearms for life by those convicted of felonies and for those convicted of misdemeanors involving domestic violence. Indiana law prohibits as follows:\\r\\nWhile Indiana law mirrors federal law for the most part, it does not ban those with non-violent felonies from possession of firearms. Therefore, a person with a non-violent felony in Indiana would be allowed to possess a firearm under Indiana law, but because federal law prohibits possession in this instance, that person would be unable to purchase a firearm since purchasing a firearm is subject to federal law and a NICS background check.[17]\\r\\nBecause firearm rights are governed by state and federal law, whether someone can restore those rights can be a tricky question even for an attorney to answer. In some circumstances a person might be able to restore their Indiana rights while not fully restoring their federal rights.\\r\\nFor those barred from possession because of a conviction for domestic battery, Indiana Code  35-47-4-7 allows one to petition the court for restoration of the right after 5 years from the date of conviction.\\r\\nRestoration of rights for those convicted of felonies is usually barred by federal law. This arises because federal law does not recognize expungements as restoring firearm rights if the expungement does not fully satisfy federal law by fully sealing the conviction so that it cannot be used in subsequent proceedings. Therefore, while an Indiana expungement restores civil rights (except for domestic battery, which requires a separate petition), it does not restore one's federal rights. The only exception is for non-violent Class D felony convictions. Because Indiana law allows those with non-violent Class D felony convictions to petition the court to reduce the felony to a Class A misdemeanor, unless a person was barred by other convictions, a successful reduction will restore a person's rights under federal and state law.[18]\\r\\nIn Indiana, the police may temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are threatening to harm themselves or others. No warrant or judge's signature is necessary. The police must submit a written statement describing why the person whose guns were seized is considered dangerous, and the person can respond at a hearing. Within 14 days a judge must agree that probable cause exists, or the person's guns must be returned.[19][20][21][22]\\r\\nCartridges that \\"can be fired in a handgun\\" that have \\"a projectile that has a metal core and an outer coating of plastic\\" are prohibited. \\"This section does not apply to nylon coated ammunition, plastic shot capsules, or ammunition designed to be used in rifles or shotguns.\\"\\r\\nIndiana provides lawsuit protection to law-abiding manufacturers, sellers, and trade associations for the misuse of firearms by third parties. Lawsuits are permitted for cases of damage or injury caused by defective firearms or ammunition, or breach of contract or warranty.[23]\\r\\nIndiana's law about self-defense (and the defense of others) can be found at Indiana Code, Title 35, Article 41, Chapter 3ÿ2.\\r\\nSuppressors are legal in the state of Indiana with the correct provisions and tax stamps to the correct federal entities and may be used for hunting.\\r\\nThe information in this article is either directly stated (or inferred) from Indiana Code, Title 35, Article 47, Chapters 1ÿ14, Title 34, Article 28, Chapter 7 and Title 34, Article 12, Chapter 3.","input":"How old do you have to be to carry a gun in indiana?"},{"output":"September 2011","context":"Edward Christopher Sheeran, MBE (born 17 February 1991) is an English singer, songwriter, guitarist, and record producer.

And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the S40,000 fundraising mark.[144]\\r\\nSheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[145] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014, and eight items of clothing he wore at the 2015 Grammy Awards.[146] In 2016 he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[147] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in Bridget Jones's Baby, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[147]\\r\\nOn 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[148]\\r\\nIn November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.[149] Sheeran was one of nearly thirty celebrities, which included Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons and Hugh Laurie, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the country struggling to keep their home warm in winter.[150]\\r\\nSheeran appeared in a November 2017 episode of Gogglebox along with other UK celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer fundraising campaign.[151]\\r\\nSheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance.[152] In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom Undateable.[153] Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap Home and Away, as a character based on himself.[154]\\r\\nAfter recording a cover version of Foy Vance's \\"Make It Rain\\" for Sons of Anarchy, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama The Bastard Executioner on FX.[155] Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film Bridget Jones's Baby in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Rene Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival where he is performing.[156]\\r\\nIn July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a longer cameo on Game of Thrones in a scene together with actress Maisie Williams, who plays the character Arya Stark.[157] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[158] It received a mix of positive and very critical reviews.[159][160]\\r\\nIn early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[64][161] He also bought a house in South London in 2014.[64] He lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee and Los Angeles, California during 2013.[162]\\r\\nSheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \\"Drunk\\") in 2012, before breaking up.[163] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs \\"Nina\\" and \\"Photograph\\", while most of Nesbitt's album, Peroxide, is about Sheeran.[163] In January 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[164] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song \\"Thinking Out Loud\\".[165] They broke up in February 2015.[165] Since July 2015, Sheeran has been in a relationship with childhood friend and former high school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[166] They announced their engagement in January 2018.[167] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, and collaborated on her albums Red and Reputation.[133]\\r\\nIn June 2015, Forbes listed his earnings at $57?million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[168] On 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his \\"outstanding contribution to music\\".[169] Sheeran commented: \\"Suffolk is very much where I call home. Receiving this recognition is a real privilege.\\"[169]\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that Sheeran had to have stitches on his right cheek after an accident at a party held at the home of Princess Beatrice of York at Royal Lodge, in Windsor, Berkshire. According to this account, singer-songwriter James Blunt was also at the party and joked that he would love a knighthood, at which point Beatrice jokingly said she could arrange it and fetched a ceremonial sword. Blunt got down on one knee while Beatrice held the sword above him and said, \\"Arise, Sir James.\\" She then swung the sword over her shoulder, unaware that Sheeran was standing behind her.[170] However, Blunt later said that the story was made up, and that Sheeran had cut himself while drunk.[171] In October 2017, Sheeran broke his wrist, elbow and rib in a cycling accident, although he was able to cycle to the pub afterwards.[172][173]\\r\\nSheeran supported Vote Remain at the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum in 2016, voicing his opposition to Brexit.[174] In a December 2017 interview with The Sunday Times' \\"Culture\\" magazine, Sheeran spoke of his admiration for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. \\"I love Corbyn.

The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third.[8] The leader of the general classification received a light blue and yellow jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2017 Tour de Yorkshire, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing in the top ten in a stage.

Legally, it often includes any alcoholic beverage with 5% or more alcohol by volume made with malted barley. In common usage, it refers to beers containing a high alcohol content, generally above 6%, which are made with ingredients and processes resembling those for American-style lagers.\\r\\nIn parts of Canada, the term \\"malt liquor\\" (French: liqueur de malt) is used to refer to any malt beverages in general.\\r\\nIn order to highlight the potency of malt liquor, American malt liquor brand names and advertisements have stressed themes of power and sexual dominance. Brewers' use of target marketing in advertising malt liquor primarily to young, male African-American residents of inner city areas in the United States has been controversial, due to the drink having higher alcohol content than ordinary beer and the perceived vulnerability of the target audience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMalt liquor is a strong lager or ale in which sugar, corn or other adjuncts are added to the malted barley to boost the total amount of fermentable sugars in the wort, and thus boost the final alcohol concentration without creating a heavier or sweeter taste. These beers tend to be mildly hopped; that is, they are not very bitter.\\r\\nMalt liquor is typically straw to pale amber in color. While typical beer is made primarily from barley, water, and hops, malt liquors tend to make much greater use of inexpensive adjuncts such as corn, rice, or dextrose. Use of these adjuncts, along with the addition of special enzymes, results in a higher percentage of alcohol than an average beer. Higher alcohol versions, sometimes called \\"high-gravity\\" or just \\"HG\\", may contain high levels of fusel alcohols, which gives off solvent- or fuel-like aromas and flavors.[1]\\r\\nThe confusing and inconsistent use of the term \\"malt liquor\\" has to do with the vagaries of American alcoholic beverage regulations, which can vary from state to state. In some states, \\"malt liquor\\" refers to any alcoholic beverage made by fermenting grain and water; in these states a non-alcoholic beer may also be called a non-alcoholic or non-intoxicating malt liquor. In some states, products labeled \\"beer\\" must fall below a certain alcohol content, and beers that exceed the mark must be labeled as \\"malt liquor\\". While ordinary beers in the United States average around 5% alcohol by volume, malt liquors typically range from 6% up to 9% alcohol by volume. A typical legal definition is Colorado's Rev. Stat. ss. 12-47-103(19), which provides that:\\r\\n\\"Malt Liquors\\" includes beer and shall be construed to mean any beverage obtained by the alcoholic fermentation of any infusion or decoction of barley, malt, hops or any other similar products, or any combination thereof, in water containing more than three and two-tenths percent of alcohol by weight.\\r\\nAlcohol percentages measured by weight translate into larger figures when re-expressed as alcohol percentages by volume, because ethanol is less dense than water.\\r\\nThe term \\"malt liquor\\" is documented in England in 1690 as a general term encompassing both beer and ale.[2] The first mention of the term in North America appears in a patent issued by the Canadian government on July 6, 1842, to one G. Riley for \\"an improved method of brewing ale, beer, porter, and other maltliquors.\\"\\r\\nWhile Colt 45, St. Ides, Mickey's, Steel Reserve, King Cobra, and Olde English 800 are most closely associated with malt liquors in the United States, the beverage itself is older than these products. Clix is often credited as the first malt liquor made in the United States, granted a patent in 1948.[3] The first widely successful malt liquor brand in America was Country Club, which was produced in the early 1950s by the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, Missouri.\\r\\nThe core market for malt liquor brewers in the United States has been the African-American and Hispanic populations.[4] Brewers' use of target marketing in advertising malt liquor primarily to young, inner-city, African-American males has been controversial, due to the drink's higher alcohol content and the perceived vulnerability of the target audience. Brewers and advertisers have stated that they simply advertise to those who already buy their products. Critics have objected to the targeting of a segment of the population suffering disproportionately from alcohol-related disease and poor access to medical care.[5]\\r\\nIn order to highlight the potency of malt liquor, brand names have stressed powerful imagery such as Colt 45, Big Bear, and Power Master,[6] and used slogans such as \\"It's got more\\" or \\"The Real Power\\".[7] Power and sexual dominance have been common themes in advertising.[6][8] Ads for Power Master were eventually banned in the United States due to regulations against advertising the strength of alcoholic beverages.[4][9][10]\\r\\nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has reported that African Americans suffer disproportionate rates of cirrhosis of the liver and other alcohol-related health problems. In light of such statistics, African-American community leaders and some health officials have concluded that targeting high-alcohol beverage ads at this segment of the population is unethical and socially irresponsible.[5][10] In 1991, U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello criticized all alcoholic beverage companies for \\"unabashedly targeting teenagers\\" with \\"sexual imagery, cartoons, and rock and rap music\\" in television and print ads.[5]\\r\\nIn the American vernacular, a forty-ounce or simply forty is a glass or plastic bottle that holds 40 fluid ounces (1.18 litres, or 2.5 U.S. pints) of malt liquor.[1] Malt liquors are commonly sold in 40 fluid ounce bottles, among other sizes, as opposed to the standard twelve ounce (355 mL) bottle that contains a single serving of beer, although many malt liquors are offered in varying volumes.\\r\\nAfter the introduction of 40-ounce containers, which contain roughly the same amount of alcohol as five regular cocktails, \\"40s\\" became a favorite high of many youth in inner-city areas. When American suburban youth adopted the habit of drinking malt liquor, drug counselors began to refer to \\"40s\\" as \\"liquid crack\\" and \\"date-rape brew\\".[7]\\r\\nExamples of malt liquors sold in forty ounce bottles include Olde English 800, Colt 45, Mickey's, Camo 40, Black Fist, Country Club, Black Bull, Labatt Blue Dry 6.1/7.1/8.1/9.1/10.1, WildCat, Molson Dry 6.5/7.5/8.5/10.1, Private Stock, Big Bear, St. Ides, Steel Reserve 211, B40 Bull Max, King Cobra, Jeremiah Weed, and Hurricane. Dogfish Head Brewery has sporadically produced a high-end bottle-conditioned forty called \\"Liquor de Malt\\".[11] Ballantine markets its ale in a forty-ounce bottle as well.\\r\\nForties are often mentioned in hip-hop and rap culture by rap stars endorsing the \\"40\\" Ounce tradition. A similar trend was common around the late 1990s' and early 2000s' punk scene, with such songs as \\"40.oz Casualty\\" by The Casualties and \\"Rock the 40. Oz.\\" by Left?ver Crack; and \\"40oz. to Freedom\\" by Sublime.\\r\\nAt least for a brief period in the mid-1990s, some brands of malt liquor, including Olde English 800, Colt 45, and Mickey's, were available in even larger, 64-ounce glass bottles. Forty-ounce bottles are not permitted in some US states, such as Florida, where the largest container that a malt beverage may be sold at retail is 32 US fluid ounces.[12]\\r\\nWhile American malt liquor brands are rarely, if ever, exported to Europe, similar inexpensive high-alcohol beers are available in many areas there; these include the \\"super-strength lagers\\" such as Tennent's Super and Carlsberg Special Brew in the United Kingdom, and in France the \\"bires fortes\\" Amsterdam Navigator, Amsterdam Maximator and Bavaria 8.6; Arboga 10.2% of Sweden or Olvi Tuplapukki and Karhu Tosi Vahva in Finland.\\r\\nAnother example of an imported beer labeled as \\"malt liquor\\" is German brewer Spaten's Optimator, a doppelbock that weighs in at 7.6 ABV.\\r\\nThere was a short lived fashion for brewing American style malt liquors in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of these were genuine American brands brewed under license, notably Colt 45, and some were simply inspired by the style. They generally contained 5% ABV. These beers were heavily marketed for a few years but failed to make a lasting impact and are no longer produced.","input":"Whats the difference between malt liqour and beer?"},{"output":"Palais de Danse","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPryzm is a nightclub located on Upper Parliament Street in Nottingham, England. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe site became vacant when Nottingham Prison was demolished.

Williston lends its name to the Williston Basin, a huge subterranean geologic feature known for its rich deposits of petroleum, coal and potash. Williston sits atop the Bakken formation, which by the end of 2012 was predicted to be producing more oil than any other site in the United States, surpassing even Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the longtime leader in domestic output in the United States.[21]\\r\\n(The State of North Dakota provides a website detailing daily oil activity.) In 1995, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that there were 150 million barrels of oil \\"technically recoverable\\" from the Bakken shale. In April 2008, the number was said to be about four billion barrels; in 2010 geologists at Continental Resources, the major drilling operation in North Dakota, estimated the reserve at eight billion. In March 2012, after the discovery of a lower shelf of oil, it announced a possible 24 billion barrels. Although current technology allows for extraction of only about 6% of the oil trapped 0.99ÿ1.99?mi (1.6ÿ3.2?km) beneath the earth's surface, recoverable oil might eventually exceed 500 billion barrels.[21] [The recoverable oil amount in the WSJ article may be a misprint. Continental Resources estimates of original oil in place (OOIP) is 500 billion bbls of oil. Primary production using new technology could increase primary recover to 10% or 50 billion bbls of recoverable oil. Some suggest as much as 20% which would be 100 billion bbls. Other recovery rates are estimated at 3 ÿ 8% currently, or 15 billion to 40 billion bbls of recoverable oil.][citation needed]\\r\\nWilliston has seen a huge increase in population and infrastructure investments during the last several years with expanded drilling using the 'frac' petroleum extraction technique in the Bakken Formation and Three Forks Groups.[22] Examples of oil industry related infrastructure investments are the multi-acre branch campus of Baker Hughes, the Sand Creek Retail Center, and the Jim Bridger shops & offices.\\r\\nA major regional grain elevator is served by the BNSF Railway.

The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technical history of the introduction and development of oil paint, and the date of introduction of various additives (driers, thinners) is stilldespite intense research since the mid 19th centurynot well understood. The literature abounds with incorrect theories and information: in general, anything published before 1952 is suspect.[1] Until 1991 nothing was known about the organic aspect of cave paintings from the Paleolithic era. Many assumptions were made about the chemistry of the binders.\\r\\nThe oldest known oil paintings date from 650 AD, found in 2008 in caves in Afghanistan's Bamiyan Valley, \\"using walnut and poppy seed oils.\\"[2]\\r\\nThough the ancient Mediterranean civilizations of Greece, Rome, and Egypt used vegetable oils, there is little evidence to indicate their use as media in painting. Indeed, linseed oil was not used as a medium because of its tendency to dry very slowly, darken, and crack, unlike mastic and wax (the latter of which was used in encaustic painting).\\r\\nGreek writers such as Aetius Amidenus recorded recipes involving the use of oils for drying, such as walnut, poppy, hempseed, pine nut, castor, and linseed. When thickened, the oils became resinous and could be used as varnish to seal and protect paintings from water. Additionally, when yellow pigment was added to oil, it could be spread over tin foil as a less expensive alternative to gold leaf.\\r\\nEarly Christian monks maintained these records and used the techniques in their own artworks. Theophilus Presbyter, a 12th-century German monk, recommended linseed oil but advocated against the use of olive oil due to its long drying time. Oil paint was mainly used as it is today in house decoration, as a tough waterproof cover for exposed woodwork, especially outdoors.\\r\\nIn the 13th century, oil was used to detail tempera paintings. In the 14th century, Cennino Cennini described a painting technique utilizing tempera painting covered by light layers of oil. The slow-drying properties of organic oils were commonly known to early painters. However, the difficulty in acquiring and working the materials meant that they were rarely used (and indeed the slow drying was seen as a disadvantage[3]).\\r\\nAs public preference for naturalism increased, the quick-drying tempera paints became insufficient to achieve the very detailed and precise effects that oil could achieve. The Early Netherlandish painting of the 15th century saw the rise of the panel painting purely in oils, or oil painting, or works combining tempera and oil painting, and by the 16th century easel painting in pure oils had become the norm, using much the same techniques and materials found today. The claim by Vasari that Jan van Eyck \\"invented\\" oil painting, while it has cast a long shadow, is not correct, but van Eyck's use of oil paint achieved novel results in terms of precise detail and mixing colours wet-on-wet with a skill hardly equalled since. Van Eycks mixture may have consisted of piled glass, calcined bones, and mineral pigments boiled in linseed oil until they reached a viscous stateor he may have simply used sun-thickened oils (slightly oxidized by Sun exposure). He left no written documentation.\\r\\nThe Flemish-trained or influenced Antonello da Messina, who Vasari wrongly credited with the introduction of oil paint to Italy,[4] does seem to have improved the formula by adding litharge, or lead (II) oxide. The new mixture had a honey-like consistency and better drying properties (drying evenly without cracking). This mixture was known as oglio cotto\\"cooked oil.\\" Leonardo da Vinci later improved these techniques by cooking the mixture at a very low temperature and adding 5 to 10% beeswax, which prevented darkening of the paint. Giorgione, Titian, and Tintoretto each may have altered this recipe for their own purposes.\\r\\nThe use of any cooked oils or litharge darkens an oil painting rapidly.[citation needed] None of the old Masters whose work survives used these in their paintings.[citation needed] Both ingredients became popular in the 19th century. Since that time, experiments to improve paint and coatings have been conducted with other oils. Modern oil paints are created from bladderpod, ironweed, calendula and sandmat, plants used to increase the resistance or to reduce the drying time.\\r\\nThe paint tube was invented in 1841 by portrait painter John Goffe Rand,[5] superseding pig bladders and glass syringes[6] as the primary tool of paint transport. Artists, or their assistants, previously ground each pigment by hand, carefully mixing the binding oil in the proper proportions. Paints could now be produced in bulk and sold in tin tubes with a cap. The cap could be screwed back on and the paints preserved for future use, providing flexibility and efficiency to painting outdoors. The manufactured paints had a balanced consistency that the artist could thin with oil, turpentine, or other mediums.\\r\\nPaint in tubes also changed the way some artists approached painting. The artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, Without tubes of paint, there would have been no Impressionism. For the impressionists, tubed paints offered an easily accessible variety of colors for their plein air palettes, motivating them to make spontaneous color choices. With greater quantities of preserved paint, they were able to apply paint more thickly.\\r\\nTraditional oil paints require an oil that always hardens, forming a stable, impermeable film. Such oils are called siccative, or drying, oils, and are characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. One common measure of the siccative property of oils is iodine number, the number of grams of iodine one hundred grams of oil can absorb. Oils with an iodine number greater than 130 are considered drying, those with an iodine number of 115-130 are semi-drying, and those with an iodine number of less than 115 are non-drying. Linseed oil, the most prevalent vehicle for artists' oil paints, is a drying oil.\\r\\nWhen exposed to air, oils do not undergo the same evaporative process that water does. Instead, they polymerize into a dry semisolid. This rate of process can be very slow, depending on the oil.\\r\\nThe advantage of the slow-drying quality of oil paint is that an artist can develop a painting gradually. Earlier media such as egg tempera dried quickly, which prevented the artist from making changes or corrections. With oil-based paints, revising was comparatively easy. The disadvantage is that a painting might take months or years to finish, which might disappoint an anxious patron. Oil paints blend well with each other, making subtle variations of color possible as well as creating many details of light and shadow. Oil paints can be diluted with turpentine or other thinning agents, which artists take advantage to paint in layers.\\r\\nThe earliest and still most commonly used vehicle is linseed oil, pressed from the seed of the flax plant. Modern processes use heat or steam to produce refined varieties of oil with fewer impurities, but many artists prefer cold-pressed oils.[7] Other vegetable oils such as hemp, poppy seed, walnut, sunflower, safflower, and soybean oils may be used as alternatives to linseed oil for a variety of reasons. For example, safflower and poppy oils are paler than linseed oil and allow for more vibrant whites straight from the tube.\\r\\nOnce the oil is extracted, additives are sometimes used to modify its chemical properties. In this way, the paint can be made to dry more quickly (if that is desired), or to have varying levels of gloss, like Liquin. Modern oils paints can, therefore, have complex chemical structures; for example, affecting resistance to UV. By hand, the process involves first mixing the paint pigment with the linseed oil to a crumbly mass on a glass or marble slab. Then, a small amount at a time is ground between the slab and a glass Muller (a round, flat-bottomed glass instrument with a hand grip). Pigment and oil are ground together 'with patience' until a smooth, ultra-fine paste is achieved. This paste is then placed into jars or metal paint tubes and labelled.\\r\\nThe color of oil paint is derived from small particles of colored pigments mixed with the carrier, the oil. Common pigment types include mineral salts such as white oxides: zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and the red to yellow cadmium pigments. Another class consists of earth types such as sienna or umber. Still another group of pigments comes from living organisms, such as madder root. Synthetic organic pigments are also now available. Natural pigments have the advantage of being well understood through centuries of use, but synthetics have greatly increased the spectrum of available colors, and many have attained a high level of lightfastness.\\r\\nWhen oil paint was first introduced in the arts, basically the same limited range of available pigments were used that had already been applied in tempera: yellow ochre, umbre, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, kermes, azurite, ultramarine, verdigris, lamp black and lead white. These pigments strongly varied in price, transparency and lightfastness. They included both anorganic and organic substances, the latter often being far less permanent. The painter bought them from specialised traders, \\"colour men\\", and let his apprentices grind them with oil in his studio to obtain paint of the desired viscosity.\\r\\nDuring the Age of discovery, new pigments became known in Europe, mostly of the organic type, such as crimson and Indian yellow. In the eighteenth century, the developing science of chemistry deliberately tried to expand the range of pigments, which led to the discovery of Prussian blue and cobalt blue.\\r\\nMany of the historical pigments were dangerous, and many pigments still in popular use today are highly toxic. Some of the most poisonous pigments, such as Paris green (copper(II) acetoarsenite) and orpiment (arsenic sulfide), have fallen from use.\\r\\nMany pigments still in use are toxic to some degree. Commonly used reds and yellows are produced using cadmium, and vermilion red uses natural or synthetic mercuric sulfide or cinnabar. Flake white and Cremnitz white are made with basic lead carbonate. Some intense blue colors, including cobalt blue and cerulean blue, are made with cobalt compounds. Some varieties of cobalt violet are made with cobalt arsenate.","input":"The most common medium for oil paint is?"},{"output":"publishing","context":"A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Sometimes, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the mainstream music industry, recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base, market their albums, and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services, radio, and television. Record labels provide publicists, who assist performers in gaining positive media coverage, and arrange for their merchandise to be available via stores and other media outlets.\\r\\nBut an increasing number of artists have sought to avoid costs and gain new audiences via the Internet, often with the help of videos. Combined with the decline in album sales and rapid growth in free content available online, this has changed the way the industry works dramatically since the beginning of the 21st century. It has caused record labels to seek new sources of profit, in particular via \\"360\\" deals (see below, under \\"new label strategies\\").\\r\\nRecord labels may be small, localized and \\"independent\\" (\\"indie\\"), or they may be part of a large international media group, or somewhere in between. As of 2012, there are only three labels that can be referred to as \\"major labels\\" (Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group).[2] A \\"sublabel\\" is a label that is part of a larger record company but trades under a different name.\\r\\nWhen a label is strictly a trademark or brand, not a company, then it is usually called an \\"imprint\\", a term used for the same concept in publishing. An imprint is sometimes marketed as being a \\"project\\", \\"unit\\", or \\"division\\" of a record label company, even though there is no legal business structure associated with the imprint.\\r\\nRecord companies and music publishers that are not under the control of the big three are generally considered to be independent (indie), even if they are large corporations with complex structures. The term indie label is sometimes used to refer to only those independent labels that adhere to independent criteria of corporate structure and size, and some consider an indie label to be almost any label that releases non-mainstream music, regardless of its corporate structure.\\r\\nIndependent labels are often considered more artist-friendly. Though they may have less financial clout, indie labels typically offer larger artist royalty with 50% profit-share agreement, aka 50-50 deal, not uncommon.[3]\\r\\nMusic collectors often use the term sublabel to refer to either an imprint or a subordinate label company (such as those within a group). For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, \\"4th & B'way\\" was a trademarked brand owned by Island Records Ltd. in the UK and by a subordinate branch, Island Records, Inc., in the United States. The center label on a 4th & Broadway record marketed in the United States would typically bear a 4th & B'way logo and would state in the fine print, \\"4th & B'way?, an Island Records, Inc. company\\". Collectors discussing labels as brands would say that 4th & B'way is a sublabel or imprint of just \\"Island\\" or \\"Island Records\\". Similarly, collectors who choose to treat corporations and trademarks as equivalent might say 4th & B'way is an imprint and/or sublabel of both Island Records, Ltd. and that company's sublabel, Island Records, Inc. However, such definitions are complicated by the corporate mergers that occurred in 1989 (when Island was sold to PolyGram) and 1998 (when PolyGram merged with Universal). Island remained registered as corporations in both the United States and UK, but control of its brands changed hands multiple times as new companies were formed, diminishing the corporation's distinction as the \\"parent\\" of any sublabels.\\r\\nVanity labels are labels that bear an imprint that gives the impression of an artist's ownership or control, but in fact represent a standard artist/label relationship. In such an arrangement, the artist will control nothing more than the usage of the name on the label, but may enjoy a greater say in the packaging of his or her work. An example of such a label is the Neutron label owned by ABC while at Phonogram Inc. in the UK. At one point artist Lizzie Tear (under contract with ABC themselves) appeared on the imprint, but it was devoted almost entirely to ABC's offerings and is still used for their re-releases (though Phonogram owns the masters of all the work issued on the label).\\r\\nHowever, not all labels dedicated to particular artists are completely superficial in origin. Many artists, early in their careers, create their own labels which are later bought out by a bigger company. If this is the case it can sometimes give the artist greater freedom than if they were signed directly to the big label. There are many examples of this kind of label, such as Nothing Records, owned by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails; and Morning Records, owned by the Cooper Temple Clause, who were releasing EPs for years before the company was bought by RCA.\\r\\nA label typically enters into an exclusive recording contract with an artist to market the artist's recordings in return for royalties on the selling price of the recordings. Contracts may extend over short or long durations, and may or may not refer to specific recordings. Established, successful artists tend to be able to renegotiate their contracts to get terms more favorable to them, but Prince's much-publicized 1994ÿ1996 feud with Warner Bros. provides a strong counterexample, as does Roger McGuinn's claim, made in July 2000 before a US Senate committee, that the Byrds never received any of the royalties they had been promised for their biggest hits, \\"Mr.?Tambourine Man\\" and \\"Turn! Turn!, Turn!\\".[4]\\r\\nA contract either provides for the artist to deliver completed recordings to the label, or for the label to undertake the recording with the artist. For artists without a recording history, the label is often involved in selecting producers, recording studios, additional musicians, and songs to be recorded, and may supervise the output of recording sessions. For established artists, a label is usually less involved in the recording process.\\r\\nThe relationship between record labels and artists can be a difficult one. Many artists have had albums altered or censored in some way by the labels before they are releasedsongs being edited, artwork or titles being changed, etc.[citation needed] Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made. Often the record label's decisions are prudent ones from a commercial perspective, but this typically frustrates the artists who feels that their art is being diminished or misrepresented by such actions.\\r\\nIn the early days of the recording industry, recording labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist.[citation needed] The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they sometimes ended up signing agreements in which they sold the rights to their recordings to the record label in perpetuity. Entertainment lawyers are usually employed by artists to discuss contract terms.\\r\\nThrough the advances of the Internet the role of labels is becoming increasingly changed, as artists are able to freely distribute their own material through web radio, peer to peer file sharing such as BitTorrent, and other services, for little or no cost but with little financial return. Established artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, whose career was developed with major label backing, announced an end to their major label contracts, citing that the uncooperative nature of the recording industry with these new trends are hurting musicians, fans and the industry as a whole.[5] Nine Inch Nails later returned to working with a major label,[6] admitting that they needed the international marketing and promotional reach that a major label can provide. Radiohead also cited similar motives with the end of their contract with EMI when their album In Rainbows was released as a \\"pay what you want\\" sales model as an online download, but they also returned to a label for a conventional release.[7] Research shows that record labels still control most access to distribution.[8]\\r\\nThroughout time, artists have had clashes between themselves and their record labels. The clashes come about from things such as: album releases per year, desire to terminate or change contracts, royalties, and limitations on artist expression. Prince stirred much conflict between himself and his record label Warner Brothers. Prince was constantly creating music, and he wanted all of it to be released to his fans, regardless of what his record label suggested.[9] Another example is the artist Kesha. She alleged that she was raped by producer, Dr. Luke, when she was intoxicated by a substance. She went to court to free herself from her contract, and while the trial was in progress she received much support from fans and other artists such as Lorde, Lady Gaga, Kelly Clarkson, and Ariana Grande.[10]\\r\\nWith the advancement of the computer and technology such as the Internet, leading to an increase in file sharing and direct-to-fan digital distribution, combined with music sales plummeting in recent years,[11] labels and organizations have had to change their strategies and the way they work with artists. New types of deals are being made with artists called \\"multiple rights\\" or \\"360\\" deals with artists. These types of pacts give labels rights and percentages to artist's touring, merchandising, and endorsements. In exchange for these rights, labels usually give higher advance payments to artists, have more patience with artist development, and pay higher percentages of CD sales. These 360 deals are most effective when the artist is established and has a loyal fan base. For that reason, labels now have to be more relaxed with the development of artists because longevity is the key to these types of pacts. Several artists such as Paramore, Maino, and even Madonna have signed such types of deals.\\r\\nA look at an actual 360 deal offered by Atlantic Records to an artist shows a variation of the structure. Atlantic's document offers a conventional cash advance to sign the artist, who would receive a royalty for sales after expenses were recouped. With the release of the artist's first album, however, the label has an option to pay an additional $200,000 in exchange for 30 percent of the net income from all touring, merchandise, endorsements, and fan-club fees. Atlantic would also have the right to approve the act's tour schedule, and the salaries of certain tour and merchandise sales employees hired by the artist. But the label also offers the artist a 30 percent cut of the label's album profitsif anywhich represents an improvement from the typical industry royalty of 15 percent.[12]\\r\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies. CDs still flow through a handful of sources, with the majority of the sales going through the \\"big three\\" record labels.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, as a result of the widespread use of home studios, consumer recording technology, and the Internet, independent labels began to become more commonplace. Independent labels are often artist-owned (although not always), with a stated intent often being to control the quality of the artist's output. Independent labels usually do not enjoy the resources available to the \\"big three\\" and as such will often lag behind them in market shares. Often independent artists manage a return by recording for a much smaller production cost of a typical big label release. Sometimes they are able to recoup their initial advance even with much lower sales numbers.\\r\\nOn occasion, established artists, once their record contract has finished, move to an independent label. This often gives the combined advantage of name recognition and more control over one's music along with a larger portion of royalty profits. Artists such as Dolly Parton, Aimee Mann, Prince, Public Enemy, BKBravo (Kua and Rafi), among others, have done this. Historically, companies started in this manner have been re-absorbed into the major labels (two examples are American singer Frank Sinatra's Reprise Records, which has been owned by Warner Music Group for some time now, and musician Herb Alpert's A&M Records, now owned by Universal Music Group). Similarly, Madonna's Maverick Records (started by Madonna with her manager and another partner) was to come under control of Warner Music when Madonna divested herself of controlling shares in the company.\\r\\nThere are many independent labels such as folk singer Ani DiFranco's Righteous Babe Records. The singer turned down lucrative contracts from several top-name labels in order to establish her own New York-based company. Constant touring resulted in noteworthy success for an act without significant major funding. DiFranco and others from the company have spoken on several occasions about their business model in the hope of encouraging others.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases, purchase the label completely.\\r\\nOn the punk rock scene, the DIY ethic encourages bands to self-publish and self-distribute. This approach evolved out of necessity around since the early 1980s, due to the major labels' aversion to signing the punk rock bands that spawned after the initial wave in the mid-70s. Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the big record labels at all. One of the most notable and influential labels of the Do-It-Yourself attitude was SST Records, created by the band Black Flag. No labels wanted to release their material, so they simply created their own label to release not only their own material but the material of many other influential underground bands all over the country. Ian MacKaye's Dischord is often cited as a model of success in the DIY community, having survived for over thirty years with less than twelve employees at any one time.\\r\\nWith the Internet now being a viable source for obtaining music, netlabels have emerged. Depending on the ideals of the net label, music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via PayPal or other online payment system. Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download. Digital Labels are the latest version of a 'net' label. Whereas 'net' labels were started as a free site, digital labels are more competition for the major record labels.[13]\\r\\nThe new century brought the phenomenon of open-source or open-content record label. These are inspired by the free software and open source movements and the success of GNU/Linux.\\r\\nIn the mid-2000s, some music publishing companies began undertaking the work traditionally done by labels. The publisher Sony/ATV Music, for example, leveraged its connections within the Sony family to produce, record, distribute, and promote Elliott Yamin's debut album under a dormant Sony-owned imprint, rather than waiting for a deal with a proper label.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecord labels are often under the control of a corporate umbrella organization called a \\"music group\\". A music group is typically owned by an international conglomerate \\"holding company\\", which often has non-music divisions as well. A music group controls and consists of music publishing companies, record (sound recording) manufacturers, record distributors, and record labels. As of 2007, the \\"big four\\" music groups control about 70% of the world music market, and about 80% of the United States music market.[16][17] Record companies (manufacturers, distributors, and labels) may also constitute a \\"record group\\" which is, in turn, controlled by a music group. The constituent companies in a music group or record group are sometimes marketed as being \\"divisions\\" of the group.","input":"What type of company is a record label?"},{"output":"\\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\"","context":"\\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" (also known in short as just \\"And I Am Telling You\\") is a torch song from the Broadway musical Dreamgirls, with lyrics by Tom Eyen and music by Henry Krieger. In the context of the musical, \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" is sung by the character Effie White, a singer with the girl group The Dreams, to her manager, Curtis Taylor Jr., whose romantic and professional relationship with Effie is quickly ending. The lyrics to \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\", often considered the show's signature tune, describe Effie's love for Curtis, both strongly devoted and defiant. She refuses to let Curtis leave her behind, and boldly proclaims to him, \\"I'm staying and you ... you're gonna love me.\\"\\r\\nIn addition to its presence in the musical, \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" is also notable as the debut single of two women who portrayed Effie. Jennifer Holliday originated the role on Broadway in 1981 and won a Tony Award for her performance as well as the Grammy for Best R&B Performance, Female for its re-release in 1982 for which it became a number-one R&B hit for Holliday.

The song can be heard on her debut album Jennifer Hudson (2008).\\r\\nHudson's version received outstanding reviews from multiple movie and music critics, which highlighted her strength as both a vocalist and an actress. New York Observer described Hudson's performance as \\"five mellifluous, molto vibrato minutes....\\"[3] Newsweek said that when moviegoers hear Hudson sing the song, she \\"is going to raise goose bumps across the land.\\"[4] Variety wrote that Hudson's performance \\"calls to mind debuts like Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl or Bette Midler in The Rose, with a voice like the young Aretha.\\"[5]\\r\\nOn June 26, 2007, the 7th Annual BET Awards opened with Jennifer Holliday and Jennifer Hudson performing \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" live in their first duet together.\\r\\nAlthough it in essence is Hudson's first single release, it became her fourth top 75 hit in the United Kingdom after a performance on The X Factor in 2009 after being sung by Danyl Johnson.[6] Hudson performed the song again at the 85th Academy Awards, as part of the Dreamgirls section in the tribute to movie musicals.\\r\\nA club remix was created for this single, engineered by Richie Jones and Eric Kupper, and appears as a bonus track on the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of the Dreamgirls soundtrack album. This version of Hudson's \\"And I Am Telling You\\" was a chart success, reaching the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in early 2007. A shortened edit of the full remix appeared on a Columbia Records promotional-only CD accompanying the Jones & Kupper remix of another Dreamgirls song, the Beyonc Knowles/Anika Noni Rose/Sharon Leal/Jennifer Hudson rendition of \\"One Night Only\\". Also included were the Freemasons remixes of Beyonc's singles \\"Dj Vu\\" and \\"Ring the Alarm\\".\\r\\nWhitney Houston performed the song at the beginning of a medley with \\"I Have Nothing\\" at the 1994 American Music Awards. This performance is included on her 2014 CD/DVD release, Live: Her Greatest Performances.[7] Houston also performed the tune as part of the set list during her Bodyguard Tour in 1993.\\r\\nIn 1994, Donna Giles scored a minor club hit in the US and UK with her rendition of the song. The track remained a sleeper club hit in the UK throughout 1995, prompting a spate of re-releases and remixes, including Stonebridge, culminating in a major release on Ore Records in 1996. This last release would finally take the track to number 27 on the UK Singles Chart in February of that year. On November 20, 2007, the original master, Produced by critically acclaimed Eve Nelson, was released digitally by Breaking Records and is available on all major download sites.\\r\\nJake Gyllenhaal performed it on Saturday Night Live shortly after the film's release in a mock performance of Jennifer Hudson. He wore a wig, black heels, and a black sequin dress. Three of the regulars on SNL were his \\"backup singers\\", also dressed in a black dress, heels, and wigs.\\r\\nIn 2006 the 12 years old Bianca Ryan sang this song on her first audition at America Got Talent show. The judge are amazed and Bianca won the America Got Talent contest that year.\\r\\nIn 2009, it was covered by Amber Riley as her character Mercedes Jones in the first-season Glee episode \\"Sectionals\\".\\r\\nAmerican Idol runner-up Jessica Sanchez performed the song as one of her two songs in the Top 4. Her performance during the Top 4 was praised by Jennifer Holliday.[8] She later performed the song with Holliday during the finale of the show's eleventh season in 2012.[9]\\r\\nDami Im, the 2013 winner of the Australian version of The X Factor, performed this song as one of her final three songs.[10] Her performance received a rapturous response from all four judges and the audience. All four judges stood up on the judges table as an indication of their overwhelming adulation of her exquisite performance while the audience applauded strongly for 70 seconds.[11] Her performance debuted number 29 on the Australian ARIA Charts. On 1 December 2013, Im released a version of the song as part of her self-titled album, which debuted at number one in Australia, and was certified Platinum.[12]\\r\\nAlso in 2013, Sam Bailey performed it with Nicole Scherzinger as her celebrity duet choice during the first part of the tenth-season finale of The X Factor in the UK. The duet also appeared on her 2014 debut album The Power of Love.\\r\\nIn 2015, Jamie Foxx performed an improvised spoof of the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, with the words to \\"On Top of Spaghetti.\\" [13]\\r\\nIn an episode of Martin, Gina (Tisha Campbell) performs the song while interrupting Pam's performance of the song \\"Home\\" (from The Wiz) on Martin's talk show \\"Word On the Street.\\" As they both are auditioning for Biggie Smalls, they attempt to out-sing each other, ultimately resulting in embarrassing Martin.\\r\\nIn Britain's Got Talent 2017, Sarah Ikumu sang this song as her audition piece.

It is an important transport hub for public transport in the city. In addition to the train services there are bus services to many parts of the city and surrounding districts, and a ferry to the city centre. Bristol's other major station, Bristol Parkway, is on the northern outskirts of the conurbation.\\r\\nTemple Meads was opened on 31 August 1840 as the western terminus of the Great Western Railway from London Paddington, 116?miles 31?chains (187.3?km) from Paddington. The railway (including Temple Meads) was the first one designed by the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Soon the station was also used by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, the Bristol Harbour Railway and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. To accommodate the increasing number of trains, the station was expanded in the 1870s by Francis Fox and again between 1930-35 by Percy Emerson Culverhouse.[1] Brunel's terminus is no longer part of the operational station. The historical significance of the station has been noted, and most of the site is Grade I listed.[1]\\r\\nThe platforms are numbered 1 to 15 but passenger trains are confined to just eight tracks. Most platforms are numbered separately at each end, with odd numbers at the east end and even numbers at the west. Platform 2 is not signalled for passenger trains, and there is no platform 14.[2]\\r\\nTemple Meads is managed by Network Rail[3] and the majority of services are operated by the present-day Great Western Railway. Other operators are CrossCountry and South Western Railway. In the 12 months to March 2014, 9.5 million entries and exits were recorded at the station.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Temple Meads derives from the nearby Temple Church, which was gutted by bombing during World War II.[4] The word \\"meads\\" is a derivation of \\"m?d\\", an Old English variation of \\"m?dwe\\", meadow, referring to the water meadows alongside the River Avon that were part of Temple parish. As late as 1820 the site was undeveloped pasture outside the boundaries of the old city,[5] some distance from the commercial centre. It lay between the Floating Harbour and the city's cattle market, which was built in 1830.\\r\\nThe original terminus was built in 1839ÿ41 for the Great Western Railway (GWR), the first passenger railway in Bristol, and was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the railway's engineer.[6] It was built to Brunel's 7?ft (2,134?mm) broad gauge. The station was on a viaduct to raise it above the level of the Floating Harbour and River Avon, the latter being crossed via the grade I listed Avon Bridge. The station was covered by a 200-foot (60?m) train shed, extended beyond the platforms by 155 feet (47?m) into a storage area and engine shed, fronted by an office building in the Tudor style.[7] Train services to Bath commenced on 31 August 1840 and were extended to Paddington on 30 June 1841 following the completion of Box Tunnel.[8]\\r\\nA few weeks before the start of the services to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER) had opened, on 14 June 1841,[9] its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845.[8] This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the far side of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge.[9] Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.\\r\\nIn 1845 the B&ER built its own station at right angles to the GWR station and an \\"express platform\\" on the curve linking the two lines so that through trains no longer had to reverse. The wooden B&ER station was known locally as \\"The Cowshed\\";[7] but a grand headquarters was built at street level on the west side of its station in 1852ÿ54 to the Jacobean designs of Samuel Fripp.[6] The Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway opened a branch off the Bristol and Exeter line west of the city on 18 April 1867, the trains being operated by the B&ER and using its platforms at Temple Meads.[10]\\r\\nIn 1850 an engine shed had been opened on the south bank of the River Avon on the east side of the line to the B&ER station.[11] Between 1859 and 1875, 23 engines were built in the workshops attached to the shed, including several distinctive Bristol and Exeter Railway 4-2-4T locomotives.[12]\\r\\nThe GWR built a 326-by-138-foot (99?m G?42?m) goods shed on the north side of the station adjacent to the Floating Harbour, with a small dock for transhipment of goods to barges (not seagoing ships, as the wharf was upstream of Bristol Bridge). Wagons had to be lowered 12 feet (4?m) to the goods shed on hoists. On 11 March 1872, a direct connection to the harbour was made in the form of the Bristol Harbour Railway, a joint operation of the three railways, which ran between the passenger station and the goods yard, across the street outside on a bridge, and descended into a tunnel under the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliffe on its way to a wharf downstream of Bristol Bridge.[7]\\r\\nThe B&ER had a goods depot at Pylle Hill (south of the station) from 1850, and the MR had an independent yard at Avonside Wharf on the opposite side of the Floating Harbour from 1858.[13]\\r\\nOn 29 May 1854 the Midland Railway laid a third rail along their line to Gloucester to provide mixed gauge so that it could operate 4?ft?8?1?2?in (1,435?mm) standard gauge passenger trains while broad gauge goods trains could still run to collieries north of Bristol. Sidings at South Wales Junction allowed traffic to be transhipped between wagons on the two different gauges. The GWR continued to operate its trains on the broad gauge,[8] but on 3 September 1873 it opened the standard gauge Bristol and North Somerset Railway. This had a junction nearly 1?2 mile (800?m) from the station on the London line and so mixed gauge was extended to that point. During the following year mixed gauge track was continued beyond Bath in connection with the conversion of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway to standard gauge. Mixed gauge was laid through Box Tunnel on 16 May 1875 and so standard gauge trains could run to London, although broad gauge was retained west of Temple Meads and through trains from London to Penzance and other stations in Devon and Cornwall continued to be broad gauge.[9] Goods traffic was transhipped between the two gauges in the B&ER yard at Pylle Hill.\\r\\nThe B&ER converted the line to Taunton to mixed gauge by 1 June 1875, but the remainder of the line to Exeter was not done until 1 March 1876, three months after the B&ER had amalgamated with the GWR. The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to standard gauge on 21 May 1892[9] so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely standard gauge layout. This allowed the through station to be rebuilt with two additional platform faces.[7]\\r\\nThe additional railway routes put the two short 140-yard (130?m) platforms of Brunel's terminus under pressure and a scheme was developed to extend the station. An enabling Act of Parliament was passed in 1865 and between 1871 and 1878 the station was extensively rebuilt. Brunel's platforms were extended by 212 yards (194?m) towards London and a new three-platform through station built on the site of the express platform, while the B&ER station was closed and the site used for a new carriage shed.[14] This work is usually attributed to Brunel's former associate Matthew Digby Wyatt, but there is no documentary evidence of his involvement in the Minutes of the Station Joint Committee. The only signature on the drawings is that of Francis Fox, the engineer of the B&ER.[15] The curved wrought-iron train shed over the new through platforms was 500 feet (150?m) long on the platform wall. The goods depot was rebuilt with the inconvenient wagon hoists replaced by a steep incline from the east end of Temple Meads, which meant that the sidings in the goods shed were at right angles to their original alignment and the barge dock was filled in.[13]\\r\\nTrains on the Bristol and South Wales Union and the Midland routes operated from the terminal platforms while the GWR used the new through platforms.[7] The capital costs of the new work were split 4/14 GWR/B&ER and 10/14 MR, operating costs were split GWR 3/8, MR 3/8 and B&ER 2/8. Hence when the GWR absorbed the B&ER in 1876 the split was GWR 5/8 and MR (later LMS) 3/8, until nationalisation on 1 January 1948.[15]\\r\\nIn 1924 the goods depot was rebuilt with 15 platforms, each 575 feet (175?m) long. Large warehousing and cellar space was provided to store goods, although by this time another city centre goods depot had been opened at Canons Marsh.[13]\\r\\nBetween 1930 and 1935 the through station was expanded under the direction of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards over the old cattle market and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened.[14] All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow more flexibility.[13]\\r\\nAs part of this work four manual signal boxes were replaced by three power signal boxes, and the semaphore signals and mechanical point linkages were replaced by colour light signals and point motors. The new Bristol Temple Meads East box was the largest on the GWR with 368 miniature levers operated by three signalmen assisted by a \\"booking boy\\". The other two boxes were at Bristol Temple Meads West, and controlling the movements in and out of the new Bath Road Depot, which replaced the old B&ER locomotive works in 1934.[13]\\r\\nDuring World War II the station was bombed, which led to the destruction of the wooden spire of the clock tower above the ticket office on 3 January 1941.[14] Gas lighting was replaced by fluorescent electric lights in 1960.[13]\\r\\nBristol Panel Signal Box was built on the site of the Platform 14. When opened it controlled 280 multiple-aspect signals and 243 motor-worked points on 114 miles (183?km) of route, the largest area controlled by a single signal box on British Rail at the time.[16]\\r\\nThe construction of this signal box, completed in 1970, involved the demolition of almost half of the 1870s extension to Brunel's terminus and completely blocked rail access to the Old Station [17]\\r\\nA second main-line station serving the city, Bristol Parkway, opened in 1972. It is on the northern outskirts of the conurbation close to the M32 motorway and was designed as a park and ride facility for long-distance travellers.[18]\\r\\nIn the late 1960s the Royal Mail built a mail conveyor at the northern end of the station, with significant aesthetic impact. This was out of use for many years following the transfer of Royal Mail's activities to the West of England Mail Centre at Filton and the opening of the short-lived Railnet Hub next to Bristol Parkway station in May 2000.[19] It was finally dismantled in stages and removed between October and December 2014.[20] In 1990/91, S2 million was spent by InterCity on a renovation of the main train shed and another S7 million on restoring some of the older areas of the station, including the refurbishment of the subway and construction of new retail outlets. The shorter of the two 1935 platform islands had been used only for parcels traffic since the 1960s but was temporarily brought back into passenger use during this work. It was fully restored for passenger use in 2001.[14]\\r\\nIn August 1998, a 15-month, S7 million project commenced with work performed on the external facade, clocktower, roof and paving.[21][22] As part of this work, the original quarry from which the dolomite stone had originally been extracted was reopened in Abbots Leigh.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nPassenger traffic on the old North Somerset line ceased on 2 November 1959 and many more closures followed after the publication of Dr Beeching's The Reshaping of British Railways in 1963. The connection to the Bristol Harbour Railway was closed on 6 January 1964; passenger trains to Portishead were withdrawn on 7 September 1964; and most local services in the north of the city were withdrawn on 23 November 1964. The following year saw local services on the Midland route to Gloucester withdrawn[24] and the Midland route to Bath Green Park via Mangotsfield was closed on 7 March 1966. St Anne's Park and Saltford on the line towards Bath survived until 5 January 1970.[24]\\r\\nOn 12 September 1965 the terminal platforms were closed. This allowed the platforms to be renumbered with the order reversed (see list below).[13] The redundant train shed became a covered car park in February the following year, but from 1989 until 1999 the original (Brunel) part was an interactive science centre known as The Exploratory and an exhibition space. From 2002 to 2008 it housed the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum.[25] As of 2016 the shed, now known as the Passenger Shed, is a venue for events such as conferences and weddings.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nBristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, an enterprise zone with an area of 70 hectares (170 acres) centred on Temple Meads,[27] was announced in 2011,[28] and launched in 2012. Network Rail is a partner in coordinating development in the zone.[27] In November 2012, Network Rail announced a S100 million redevelopment of the station, with two unused platforms to be opened up. Station Approach Road will be turned into a public square and the station's main entrance moved to the north side.[29] A large bridge above the tracks at the east end of the station which was erected in the 1970s for postal traffic was demolished at Christmas 2014.[30] In November 2016, the University of Bristol announced that it plans to build a Temple Quarter Campus to the east of the station, replacing the derelict sorting office which was formerly connected to the station by the bridge.[31]\\r\\nBristol and Exeter House has been redeveloped by TCN UK as a business hub for small and medium-sized enterprises. Part of Brunel's station has found a new use in a redevelopment by the City Council, the University of Bristol and the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership.[27] Opened in 2013 as the Engine Shed,[28] it hosts business incubators for startups.[32]\\r\\nTo the south of the station, the former site of the Bristol Bath Road Traction Maintenance Depot is being redeveloped into the 12,000-capacity Bristol Arena.[33]\\r\\nAlthough it is now possible to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site of the goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.[7]\\r\\nOpposite these offices are the Grosvenor Hotel and the derelict George Railway Hotel, which were built in the 1870s,[6] on either side of the site of the Bristol Harbour Railway bridge. A modern pub named The Reckless Engineer as a tribute to Brunel faces the approach road to the station.\\r\\nOn the right of the Station Approach but at a lower level is the B&ER office building designed by Samuel Fripp; the 1930s offices known as \\"Collett House\\" (named after Charles Collett) and a disused parcels depot lie beyond. On the left is Brunel's original station building. The train shed is 72 feet (22?m) wide with a wooden box-frame roof and cast iron columns disguised as hammerbeams above Tudor arches. It is believed to be the widest hammerbeam roof in England and, along with most of the station, is a Grade 1 listed building,[34][35] and forms part of a proposed Great Western Railway World Heritage Site.[36] At the top of the slope an entrance on the left to the covered car park marks the junction between the original terminus and Fox's 1870s extension.\\r\\nAhead is the turreted main station building, and to the right a flat area marks the site of the B&ER station. The tunnel beneath this area was the route for passengers to and from the Down platform from 1878 until the station was enlarged in 1935.[14]\\r\\nEntering the main building, the ticket office and ticket machines are immediately ahead, and the route from Temple Quay and the ferry is on the left; a bookshop is on the right, next to the platform entrance. Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all platforms, as do displays on each of the platforms. All platforms are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station.[37] Platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the platforms).[38]\\r\\nEntrance to the platforms is controlled by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar is on the left[39] and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel is nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction maintenance depot can be seen in the distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.\\r\\nOn the right of the entrance is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift;[39] it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13ÿ15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond,[39] and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.\\r\\nThe first island platform comprises platforms 5 to 8. Platform 5 is inside the main train shed while 6 is a southerly extension and 7 and 8 were added outside the supporting wall in the 1930s.[14] Platform 5 is used by trains towards Cardiff and platform 7 to Portsmouth; platforms 6 and 8 are the main platforms for Weston-super-Mare and stations to Penzance. Between platforms 5 and 7 are the two spur sidings that are long enough to stable a single Class 153 DMU.\\r\\nThe third island platform comprises platforms 9 to 12 and also dates from the 1930s.[14] It is longer than platforms 5ÿ8 but the rear of a High Speed Train on the west end platforms will block part of the east end platform.[38] A wide variety of trains use these platforms, including to and from London Paddington and London Waterloo and Weymouth.\\r\\nThe final island platform is shorter and only has east-end platforms 13 and 15: 15 is used by most trains from Paddington that continue westwards to Weston-super-Mare or beyond. Platform 13 is a terminus platform and is used by many trains from Paddington, some local services and occasionally by CrossCountry. There is another siding beyond platform 15 that used to be the In/Out Road for Bath Road Traction Maintenance Depot. This depot has been demolished. Between platforms 3/4 and 5/6 are the Up Through line and the Middle Siding, the latter is often used to stable Mark 1 carriages between Torbay Express duties in the summer months. The Down Through line runs between platforms 11/12 and 13.[38]\\r\\nTo the north of the station lies Arriva TrainCare's Barton Hill train maintenance depot that services Class 220/221 Voyagers for CrossCountry Class 66 locomotives for DB Schenker and during summer months steam locomotives operating the Torbay Express. To the south-east of the station lies St Philip's Marsh depot that services the Great Western Railway fleet. This is accessible from both ends of Temple Meads station.\\r\\nOther facilities include pay phones, public Wi-Fi, a post box, photo booth, and passenger assistance such as information points, waiting rooms, a lost property office, first aid room, and CCTV.[39]\\r\\nTemple Meads is the busiest station in the Bristol area. Official statistics show it to have the 35th-largest number of people entering or leaving any national rail station, the 14th busiest outside London. Comparing the year from April 2009 with the year from April 2002, estimated passenger numbers increased by 52%.[note 1]\\r\\nThe statistics cover twelve-month periods that start in April.\\r\\nThe station is operated by Great Western Railway, along with main line services to London Paddington station,[41] long distance services to Cardiff Central[42] and the South Coast,[43] local services to Weston-super-Mare, Taunton and Gloucester and a few services each day to/from Brighton.[44]\\r\\nAn alternative route, to London Waterloo, is provided by South Western Railway,[45] while regular CrossCountry services run south to Paignton, Plymouth and Penzance,[46] and north to Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.[47]\\r\\nTemple Meads is served by many buses operated by First West of England including:\\r\\nWessex Bus operate two routes via Temple Meads station:\\r\\nHarbour ferry services, operated by Bristol Ferry Boats and Number Seven Boat Trips, call at a landing stage in the Floating Harbour outside the station. The service links Bristol Bridge, St Augustine's Reach in the City Centre, the SS Great Britain, and Hotwells.[58]\\r\\nFirst Great Western exercised a break clause in the Greater Western franchise thus avoiding large premium payments to the Department for Transport.[59][60][61] With the franchise to now conclude in March 2013, it was put out to tender,[62][63][64] but the process was scrapped as part of the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition.[65]\\r\\nSubsequently, a new contract until September 2015 was negotiated between First Great Western and the Department for Transport[66][67] and subsequently extended until March 2019.[68][69][70] The coming years will see the High Speed Trains replaced with new Class 800/801 Intercity Express Trains, capacity enhancements and smart ticketing.[71]\\r\\nThe Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is in the process of being electrified.[72] However, because of cost overruns and delays, on 8 November 2016 the government announced that several elements of the programme would be deferred including electrification south west of Thingley Junction near Chippenham and Bristol Parkway. This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete.[73][74] The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol so local services will continue to be provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.[75][76]\\r\\nThe Portishead Branch Line, which runs along the south side of the River Avon from a junction just beyond Parson Street is proposed to be reopened.[77] There is an aspiration of two trains per hour between Portishead and Temple Meads in peak periods, possibly calling at Bedminster and Parson Street.[78][79][80][81][82] The line was built in the 1860s, but closed to passenger traffic in 1964, leaving Portishead as one of Britain's largest towns without a railway station. The line was reopened for freight traffic to serve Royal Portbury Docks in 2001, and the restoration of passenger traffic is considered part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme, which was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government.[77]\\r\\nThe Metro scheme could also see the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line to passengers, with the possibility of services from Temple Meads to Bristol Parkway via Clifton Down and Henbury.[77] Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board, however in July 2015 Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion.[83][84]\\r\\nThe station roof is to be refurbished as part of a scheme to transform the station over the next 25 years.[85] On 1 April 2014, Network Rail took over management of the station from First Great Western.[3][86]","input":"What is the main train station in bristol?"},{"output":"Violet Brown","context":"This is a list of the 100 verified oldest people.

The chain was known as Tote'm Stores until it was renamed in 1946. Its parent company, Seven-Eleven Japan Co., Ltd., operates, franchises, and licenses 66,579 stores in 17 countries as of 30 June 2018.[1] Seven-Eleven Japan is headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo[2] and held by the Seven & I Holdings Co.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company's first outlets were named \\"Tote'm Stores\\" because customers \\"toted\\" away their purchases. Some stores featured genuine Alaskan totem poles in front of the store. In 1946, the chain's name was changed from \\"Tote'm\\" to \\"7-Eleven\\" to reflect the company's new, extended hours, 7:00?am to 11:00?pm, seven days per week.[4] In November 1999, the corporate name of the US company was changed from \\"The Southland Corporation\\" to \\"7-Eleven Inc.\\"[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1927, Southland Ice Company employee John Jefferson Green began selling eggs, milk, and bread from one of 16 ice house storefronts in Dallas, with permission from one of Southland's founding directors, Joe C. Thompson, Sr.[7] Although small grocery stores and general merchandisers were available, Thompson theorized that selling products such as bread and milk in convenience stores would reduce the need for customers to travel long distances for basic items. He eventually bought the Southland Ice Company and turned it into Southland Corporation, which oversaw several locations in the Dallas area.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, Jenna Lira brought a totem pole as a souvenir from Alaska and placed it in front of the store. The pole served as a marketing tool for the company, as it attracted a great deal of attention. Soon, executives added totem poles in front of every store and eventually adopted an Alaska Native-inspired theme for their stores. Later on, the stores began operating under the name \\"Tote'm Stores\\". In the same year, the company began constructing gasoline stations in some of its Dallas locations as an experiment. Joe Thompson also provided a distinct characteristic to the company's stores, training the staff so that people would receive the same quality and service in every store. Southland also started to have a uniform for its ice station service boys. This became the major factor in the company's success as a retail convenience store.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1931, the Great Depression affected the company, sending it toward bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the company continued its operations through re-organization and receivership. A Dallas banker, W.W. Overton Jr., also helped to revive the company's finances by selling the company's bonds for seven cents on the dollar. This brought the company's ownership under the control of a board of directors.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1946, in an effort to continue the company's post-war recovery, the name of the franchise was changed to 7-Eleven to reflect the stores' new hours of operation (7?am to 11?pm), which were unprecedented at the time.  In 1963, 7-Eleven experimented with a 24-hour schedule in Austin, Texas, after an Austin store stayed open all night to satisfy customer demand.[4] Later on, 24-hour stores were established in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada.[9] In 1971, Southland acquired convenience stores of the former Pak-A-Sak chain owned by Graham Allen Penniman, Sr. (1903ÿ1985), of Shreveport, Louisiana.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the purchase in 1964 of 126 Speedee Mart franchised convenience stores in California, the company entered the franchise business. The company signed its first area licensing agreement in 1968 with Garb-Ko, Inc. of Saginaw, Michigan, which became the first US domestic area 7-Eleven licensee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, Southland Corporation was threatened by a rumored corporate takeover, prompting the Thompson family to take steps to convert the company into a private model by buying out public shareholders in a tender offer.[12] In December 1987, John Philp Thompson, the chairman and CEO of 7-Eleven, completed a $5.2?billion management buyout of the company.[13] The buyout suffered from the effects of the 1987 stock market crash and after failing initially to raise high yield debt financing, the company was required to offer a portion of stock as an inducement to invest in the company's bonds.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious assets, such as the Chief Auto Parts chain,[16] the ice division,[17] and hundreds of store locations,[18] were sold between 1987 and 1990 to relieve debt incurred during the buyout. This downsizing also resulted in numerous metropolitan areas losing 7-Eleven stores to rival convenience store operators. In October 1990, the heavily indebted Southland Corp. filed a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to transfer control of 70% of the company to Japanese affiliate Ito-Yokado.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthland exited bankruptcy in March 1991, after a cash infusion of $430?million from Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan. These two Japanese entities now controlled 70% of the company, with the founding Thompson family retaining 5%.[20] In 1999, Southland Corp. changed its name to 7-Eleven, Inc., citing the divestment of operations other than 7-Eleven.[21] Ito-Yokado formed Seven & I Holdings Co. and 7-Eleven became its subsidiary in 2005. In 2007, Seven & I Holdings announced that it would be expanding its American operations, with an additional 1,000 7-Eleven stores in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2010 rankings, 7-Eleven climbed to the No. 3 spot in Entrepreneur Magazine's 31st Annual Franchise 500, \\"the first and most comprehensive ranking in the world\\". This was the 17th year 7-Eleven was named in the top 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 2010, the first \\"green\\" 7-Eleven store opened in DeLand, Florida. The store features U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) elements. Also, the environmentally-friendly design brings the store savings in energy costs. That same year, 7-Eleven went mobile with the launch of the iconic Slurpee drink's iPhone and Android Application (App). The Slurpee drink app made it easy to find 7-Eleven stores and provides driving directions. The following year, 7-Eleven celebrated its 40,000th store opening and within two years of that milestone opened its 50,000th store.\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven in the United States sells Slurpee[22] drinks, a partially frozen soft drink introduced in 1965 (Oklahoma's stores are known as Icee Drink),[23] and Big Gulp beverages, introduced in 1976.[24][25] Other products include: 7-Select[26] private-brand products,[27] coffee, fresh-made daily sandwiches, fresh fruit, salads, bakery items, hot and prepared foods, gasoline, dairy products, carbonated beverages and energy drinks, juices, financial services, and product delivery services.\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven is known for its relatively large drink sizes.  7-Eleven offers beverages that are 32 ounces (946ml) (Big Gulp), 44 U.S. fluid ounces (1.301?L) (Super Big Gulp), 53 ounces (1567ml) (X-Treme Gulp), 64 ounces (1893ml) (Double Gulp), or 128 ounces (3785ml) (Team Gulp), as well as the 20 ounce Gulp.  These beverage sizes were all among the largest sold soft drinks when they were introduced.[28] 7-Eleven has often been associated with these large sodas in popular culture.  For example, Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed ban on large sodas in New York City was frequently referred to as the 'Big Gulp ban'.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, 7-Eleven changed the size of the Double Gulp from 64 ounces to 50 ounces (1478ml). The older style cups were too wide at the bottom and did not fit beverage holders in cars. This was not a reaction to the large soda ban proposal, according to a spokesperson.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven first opened in Hong Kong in 1981, and today operates as a subsidiary of the Dairy Farm. It is popularly called tsat jai (^, meaning \\"little seven\\") or se fun (D, based on the English \\"seven\\"). As of 2012, 7-Eleven had 964 stores in Hong Kong, of which 563 were operated by franchisees.[31] Hong Kong reportedly has the second-highest density of 7-Eleven stores, after Macao. All 7-Eleven stores in Hong Kong accept the ubiquitous Octopus card as a method of payment.[32] They also accept payments for utility bills and public housing rent.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1980, Southland Corporation and Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson signed a franchise agreement to bring 7-Eleven to the territory.[34] The first 7-Eleven shop opened in Happy Valley on 3 April 1981.[35][36] The chain expanded aggressively across Hong Kong throughout the 1980s. The 50th store opened in Kwai Chung on 6 October 1983, while the 200th was inaugurated by Simon Keswick at Tai Po Centre on 7 May 1987.[37][38] The stores were sold to Dairy Farm, part of the Jardine Matheson group, in 1989.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOctopus card readers were introduced in all 7-Eleven stores in July 1999, although at first these could only be used to add value to the card.[40][41] In September 2004, the number of locations in Hong Kong was substantially boosted when Dairy Farm acquired Daily Stop, a rival convenience store chain, from SCMP Retailing (HK). The chain's 84 shops, located mainly in MTR and KowloonÿCanton Railway stations (as well as shopping centres and housing estates), were converted to 7-Eleven stores.[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, a 7-Eleven location in Quarry Bay opened with a hot food counter, called \\"7 Caf\\", selling traditional Hong Kong street food and milk tea.[44] This feature was subsequently extended to select other 7-Eleven locations across Hong Kong under the \\"Daily Caf\\" and \\"Hot Shot\\" brands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, 7-Eleven announced plans to expand its business in Indonesia through a master franchise agreement with Modern Sevel Indonesia and Media Nusantara Citra. Modern Sevel Indonesia's initial plans were to focus on opening stores in Jakarta, targeting densely populated commercial and business areas.[45] There are 190 7-Eleven stores in Indonesia as of  2014[update] and it has reduced to only 166 stores as September 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2017, PT Modern Seven Indonesia announced that they will be acquired by PT Charoen Pokphand Restu Indonesia, subsidiary of Charoen Pokphand Group in Thailand. The acquisition process planned to be completed before June 2017.[46] Charoen Pokphand Group is also the master franchise holder of approximately 9500 7-Eleven stores in Thailand. But on June 22, 2017, PT Modern International Tbk announced that all the remaining 30 7-Eleven stores in Indonesia will be closed on June 30, 2017 due to the cancellation of its acquisition process.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan has more 7-Eleven locations than anywhere else in the world, where they often bear the name of its holding company \\"Seven & I Holdings\\". Of the 66,579 stores around the globe, 20,392 stores (31 percent of global stores) are in Japan,[48] with 2,665 stores in Tokyo alone.[49] On September 1, 2005, Seven & I Holdings Co., Ltd., a new holding company, became the parent company of 7-Eleven, Ito-Yokado, and Denny's Japan. 7-Eleven has stores in all prefectures of Japan, except Okinawa Prefecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aesthetics of the store are somewhat different from that of 7-Eleven stores in other countries as the stores offer a wider selection of products and services.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the example of other convenience stores in Japan, 7-Eleven has solar panels and LEDs installed in about 1,400 of its stores.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven entered the Macau market in 2005 under the ownership of Dairy Farm, the same conglomeration group operating Hong Kong's 7-Eleven. With only 25.9 square kilometres, Macau has 45 stores, making it the single market with the highest density of 7-Eleven stores, containing one store per 0.65 square kilometers.\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven opened its first store in China in Shenzhen, Guangdong in 1992 and later expanded to Beijing in 2004, Tianjin in 2009, Chengdu[51] and Shanghai in 2011, Qingdao in 2012, Chongqing in 2013, and Nanjing in 2018. In China's 7-Eleven stores where Slurpees are offered, the Chinese name  (sؐlbؐng) is used. They also offer a wide array of warm food, including traditional items like steamed buns, and stores in Chengdu offer a full variety of onigiri (a). Beverages, alcohol, candy, periodicals, and other convenience items are available as well. The majority of these stores are open for 24 hours a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalaysian 7-Eleven stores are owned by 7-Eleven Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., which operates 2,225 stores nationwide. 7-Eleven in Malaysia was incorporated on June 4, 1984, by the Berjaya Group Berhad. The first 7-Eleven store was opened in October 1984, in Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Philippines, 7-Eleven is run by the Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC). Its first store, located in Quezon City, opened in 1984. In 2000, President Chain Store Corporation (PCSC) of Taiwan, also a licensee of 7-Eleven, purchased the majority shares of PSC and thus formed a strategic alliance for the convenience store industry within the area. The number of stores reached 1,602 at the end of 2015. As of 2017, there are 2,285 7-Eleven stores all over The Philippines. Some 7-Eleven branches are in near the gas stations like in Caltex, it has transferred from Star Mart in mid-2000's to 2010 due to close of Star Mart in the Philippines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Singapore, 7-Eleven forms the largest chain of convenience stores island-wide. There are 393 7-Eleven stores scattered throughout the country as of February 2018. Stores in Singapore are operated by Dairy Farm International Holdings, franchised under a licensing agreement with 7-Eleven Incorporated. The first 7-Eleven store in Singapore was opened along Upper Changi Road in 1983, and in 1986 the first franchised 7-Eleven store (under the Jardine Matheson Group) was opened. The license was then acquired by Cold Storage Singapore, a subsidiary of the Dairy Farm Group, in 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Shell Singapore and 7-Eleven agreed to rebrand all 68 of its Shell Select convenience stores into 7-Eleven. The partnership was terminated in October 2017, and the remaining 52 7-Eleven stores in Shell petrol stations will be gradually rebranded back into Shell Select.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven has a major presence in the Republic of Korea convenience store market, where it competes with CU (store), GS25 (formerly LG25), and independent competitors. There are 9,231 7-Eleven stores in the Republic of Korea; with only Japan and Thailand hosting more stores. The first 7-Eleven store in the Republic of Korea opened in 1989 in Songpa-gu in Seoul with a franchise license under the Lotte Group. In January 2010, Lotte Group acquired the Buy the Way convenience store chain and rebranded its 1,000 stores under the 7-Eleven brand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Taiwan, 7-Eleven is the largest convenience store chain and is owned by President Chain Store Corporation under Uni-President Enterprises Corporation. The first fourteen stores opened in 1979, and struggled to make a profit. Southland Corporation partnered with Uni-President to modernize the stores. However, business was still slow, and Uni-President opted to stock Asian foods. In 1986, 7-Eleven made its first profit in Taiwan.[55] The 5,000th store was opened in July 2014.[56] In January 2018, an experimental and unstaffed shop branded the X-Store was opened.[57] There are 5,221 stores currently in Taiwan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first store opened in 1989 on Patpong Road in Bangkok. The franchise in Thailand is the CP ALL Public Company Limited, which in turn grants franchises to operators. In January 2018 there were 10,300 stores in Thailand.[58] 7-Eleven holds a 70 percent market share in the convenience store category.[59] Thailand has the second largest number of 7-Eleven stores after Japan.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven entered the Turkish market in 1989, opening its first store on September 12, 1989.[61] Major stakeholder of the master franchise, ?zer ?iller sold his shares in 1993, after his wife Tansu ?iller became the Prime Minister.[62] In the 2010s, 7-Eleven left the Turkish market, transferring most of its stores to franchise owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven & I Holdings announced in June 2014 that they had agreed a contract with Seven Emirates Investment LLC to open the first Middle Eastern 7-Eleven in Dubai, United Arab Emirates during the summer of 2015.[63][64][65] The company also said that they had plans to open about 100 stores in the country by the end of 2017.[63][65] The first store was opened in October 2015. The country has 13 stores by January 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven and i-Holding making the first 7-Eleven was open in Saigon Trade Center in 2017. As of January 2018, Vietnam has 11 stores in Ho Chi Minh City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first European 7-Eleven store was opened in Stockholm, Sweden in 1978.[66] 7-Eleven was available in Spain until 2000 with many stores inside Repsol petrol stations, as well as some other petrol-stations across the country. 7-Eleven stores are now solely located in the Scandinavian region of Europe.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe owner of the master franchise for 7-Eleven in Scandinavia is Reitan Servicehandel, an arm of the Norwegian retail group, Reitan Group. After Reitangruppen bought the filling station chain, HydroTexaco (now YX Energy), in Norway and Sweden in 2006, it announced that several of the stores at the petrol stations would be rebranded as 7-Elevens and that the petrol would be supplied by Shell. Other stores remain under the YX brand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first 7-Eleven store in Denmark was opened at ?sterbro in Copenhagen on September 14, 1993. There are 183 stores, mostly in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, and Odense, including eight stores at Copenhagen Central Station. In Denmark, 7-Eleven has an agreement with Shell, with a nationwide network of Shell/7-Eleven service stations, and an agreement with DSB to have 7-Eleven stores at most S-train stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first 7-Eleven store in Norway was opened at Grnerl?kka in Oslo on September 13, 1986. As of January 2018, there are 153 7-Eleven stores in Norway, more than 50% located in Oslo. Norway has the northernmost 7-Eleven in the world, situated in Troms?. On a per-capita basis, Norway has one 7ÿEleven store for every 47,000 Norwegians, compared to Canada, which has one for every 74,000 Canadians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reitan Group has held the license in Sweden since December 1997. In the mid-1990s period, 7-Eleven in Sweden received adverse publicity due to the unfavourable labour contracts offered by its then-licensee, Small Shops, an American-based company, resulting in many stores being sold and closed down. For a time, there were only 7-Elevens in Stockholm and Gothenburg.\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven returned to the south of Sweden in 2001, when a convenience store opened in Lund. Later in the 2000s, the Swedish 7-Eleven chain was involved in controversy when the Swedish TV channel TV3 exposed widespread fraud on the part of the Reitan Group in its management of the 7-Eleven franchise, which the Reitan Group eventually admitted to on its website.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27 August 2007, the Reitan Group and Shell, announced a ten-year agreement to re-brand some 269 service stations across Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, as 7-Elevens. The contract meant that 7-Eleven would expand from 77 stores to 189 stores in Sweden.[68] The country now has 187 stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, small 7-Eleven convenience stores were common in the larger towns and cities of London and the South East of England. The first shop opened in London, in Sydenham South East London in 1985.[69] The company ceased trading operations in 1997, but considered resuming UK trading in 2014.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first 7-Eleven store to open in Canada was in Calgary, Alberta, on June 29, 1969. There are 640 7-Eleven stores in Canada as of  2017[update].[71] Winnipeg, Manitoba, has the world's largest number of Slurpee consumers, with an estimated 1,500,000 Slurpees sold since the first 7-Eleven opened on March 21, 1970.[72] All 7-Eleven locations in Canada are corporate operated.[73] Like its U.S. counterparts every July 11 the stores offer free Slurpees on \\"7-Eleven Day\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nA limited number of 7-Eleven locations feature gas stations from Shell Canada, Petro-Canada, or Esso. In November 2005, 7-Eleven started offering the Speak Out Wireless cellphone service in Canada. 7-Eleven locations also featured CIBC ATMsin June 2012, these machines were replaced with ATMs operated by Scotiabank. 7-Eleven abandoned the Ottawa, Ontario, market in December 2009 after selling its six outlets to Quickie Convenience Stores, a regional chain. Following concerns over the fate of Speak Out Wireless customers, Quickie offered to assume existing SpeakOut customers and phones into its Good2Go cellphone program.[74][75] 7-Eleven is similarly absent from the Quebec market due to its saturation by chains like Alimentation Couche-Tard and Boni-soir, and by independent dpanneurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2016, 7-Eleven acquired 148 Imperial Oil-owned Esso gas stations in Alberta and British Columbia for C$2.8 billion. Their convenience stores were converted to 7-Eleven stores, and they remain supplied by Esso.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mexico, the first 7-Eleven store opened in 1971 in Monterrey in association with Grupo Chapa (now Iconn) and 7-Eleven, Inc. under the name Super 7. In 1995, Super 7 was renamed to 7-Eleven, which now has 1,835 stores in several areas of the country. When stores are located within classically designed buildings (such as in Centro Hist܇rico buildings) or important landmarks, the storefront logo is displayed in monochrome with gold or silver lettering. The main competitors in Mexico are OXXO (Femsa), Super City (Soriana), and Farmacias Guadalajara, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupermarket News ranked 7-Eleven's North American operations No. 11 in the 2007 \\"Top 75 North American Food Retailers,\\" based on the 2006 fiscal year estimated sales of US$15.0?billion.[77] Based on the 2005 revenue, 7-Eleven is the 24th largest retailer in the United States.[78] As of  2013[update], 8,144 7-Eleven franchised units exist across the United States. Franchise fees range between US$10,000 ÿ $1,000,000 and the ongoing royalty rate varies.[79] 7-Eleven America has its headquarters in the Cypress Waters development in Irving, Texas.[80][81] Small-size Slurpees are free on \\"7-Eleven Day\\", on July 11.\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven Stores of Oklahoma have operated independently since 1953 under an agreement with William Brown. It is now led by his son, James Brown.[82] As part of this franchise agreement, 7-Elevens in Oklahoma bear slight differences to stores elsewhere: for instance, products such as Big Bite hot dogs are not sold there, the Slurpee is branded as the \\"Icy Drink\\", and Oklahoma stores operate their own loyalty program called \\"Thx!\\", which does not intersect with the national 7Rewards system. There are currently 8,421 stores in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., many 7-Eleven locations used to have filling stations with gasoline distributed by Citgo, which in 1983 was purchased by Southland Corporation. 50% of Citgo was sold in 1986 to Petr܇leos de Venezuela, S.A., and the remaining 50% was acquired in 1990. Although Citgo was the predominant partner of 7-Eleven, other oil companies are also co-branded with 7-Eleven, including Fina, Exxon, Gulf, Marathon, BP, Shell, Chevron (some former TETCO convenience stores were co-branded with Chevron, and Texaco prior to the 7-Eleven purchase in late 2012), and Pennzoil. Conoco is the largest 7-Eleven licensee in North America.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven signed an agreement with ExxonMobil in December 2010 for the acquisition of 183 sites in Florida. This was followed by the acquisition of 51 ExxonMobil sites in North Texas in August 2011.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first 7-Eleven in Australia opened on August 24, 1977, in the Melbourne suburb of Oakleigh. The majority of stores are located in metropolitan areas, particularly in central business district areas. Stores in suburban areas often operate as petrol stations and most are owned and operated as franchises, with a central administration. 7-Eleven bought Mobil's remaining Australian petrol stations in 2010,[86] converting them to 7-Eleven outlets, resulting in an immediate and unprecedented overnight major expansion of the brand. In South Australia all Mobil petrol stations were sold to Peregrine Corporation and branded as On the Run petrol stations.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\n7-Eleven stores in Australia sell a wide range of items, including daily newspapers, drinks, confectionery, and snack foods. They sell gift cards, including three types of pre-paid Visa cards. The chain has partnered with BankWest, placing a BankWest ATM in each of their stores nationwide. Each year on November 7, 7-Eleven promotes \\"7-Eleven Day\\" by giving away a free Slurpee to customers.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2014, 7-Eleven announced plans to start operating stores in Western Australia, with 11 stores planned to operate within the first year and a total of 75 stores established within five years. The first store was opened on October 30, 2014 in the city of Fremantle.[89][90] The country has 675 stores as of January 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2015, Fairfax Media and the ABC's Four Corners programme reported on the employment practices of certain 7-Eleven franchisees in Australia.[91][92] The investigation found that many 7-Eleven employees were being underpaid at rates of around A$10 to A$14 per hour before tax, well under the legally-required minimum award rate of A$24.69 per hour.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nFranchisees underpaying their staff would typically maintain rosters and pay records that would appear to show the employee being paid the legally-required rate, however these records would in fact only include half of the hours the employee actually worked in a week. Employees would then be paid on the basis of these records, resulting in them effectively being paid half the legally-required rate.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also reported that workers were often not paid loadings and penalty rates that they are legally entitled to, for working overtime hours, nights, weekends, and public holidays.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these reports came to light and received widespread attention, some employees had alleged to Fairfax Media that they had begun to be paid correctly through the 7-Eleven payroll system, however would then be asked by the franchisee to pay back half their wages in cash.[93] 7-Eleven subsequently announced they would fund an inquiry to investigate instances of wage fraud. The inquiry is to be conducted by an independent panel chaired by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Allan Fels, and with the support of professional services firm Deloitte.[94] The inquiry invited submissions from current and former 7-Eleven employees who allege they have been underpaid, and assess each individual claim.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2015, chairman Russ Withers and chief executive Warren Wilmon announced they would resign from the company. Deputy chairman Michael Smith replaced Withers, while Bob Baily was appointed as interim chief executive.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Four Corners investigation into 7-Eleven won a Walkley Award in 2015.[97] In December 2015, Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors, who featured prominently in the Four Corners program, announced a potential class action lawsuit against 7-Eleven head office on behalf of franchisees who had allegedly been lured into signing on with 7-Eleven by false representations.[98]","input":"How many 7 elevens are in the world?"},{"output":"The Lawrenceville School","context":"Frederick Dierks Bentley[2] (born November 20, 1975[1]) is an American singer and songwriter.

A bluegrass studio album, Up on the Ridge, was released on June 8, 2010, and then a sixth album, Home, followed in February 2012, as did a seventh one, Riser, in 2014. Bentley's eighth and latest album, entitled Black was released in May 2016.[3]\\r\\nBentley's studio albums have accounted for 25 singles on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, of which 15 have reached number one: his debut single \\"What Was I Thinkin'\\", \\"Come a Little Closer\\", \\"Settle for a Slowdown\\", \\"Every Mile a Memory\\", \\"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)\\", \\"Feel That Fire\\", \\"Sideways\\", \\"Am I the Only One\\", \\"Home\\", \\"5-1-5-0\\", \\"I Hold On\\", \\"Drunk on a Plane\\", \\"Say You Do\\", \\"Somewhere on a Beach\\" and \\"Different for Girls\\". Four more of his singles have reached the top 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBentley was born on November 20, 1975[1] in Phoenix, Arizona as the son of Leon Fife Bentley (August 16, 1923 ÿ June 1, 2012), a bank vice-president, and Catherine Childs. His father was born in Glasgow, Missouri, to Richard Thomas and Mary Cecile Fife Bentley, and was a First Lieutenant in World War II. His middle name, Dierks (which he now uses as his first name publicly), is also his maternal great-grandmother's surname. He attended Culver Academies and graduated from The Lawrenceville School in 1993.[4] Afterward, he spent a year at the University of Vermont (UVM) before transferring to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he graduated in 1997.[5][6]\\r\\nBentley worked at The Nashville Network (now Spike TV), researching old footage of country performances. In 2003, Capitol Nashville released Bentley's self-titled debut album. The album's first single, \\"What Was I Thinkin',\\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts[7] later that year. The next two singles from that album, \\"My Last Name\\" and \\"How Am I Doin',\\" reached No. 17[7] and No. 4,[7] respectively.The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA.\\r\\nBentley's second Capitol album, Modern Day Drifter, was released in 2005. It spawned two number one singles, \\"Settle for a Slowdown\\"[7] and \\"Come a Little Closer,\\"[7] and the top 5 hit, \\"Lot of Leavin' Left to Do.\\"[7] The album was also certified platinum.\\r\\nIn 2005, Bentley won the CMA Award for the Horizon Award (now Best New Artist) and was invited to be a member of the Grand Ole Opry.[8] The induction took place on October 1, 2005. Bentley stands as the third youngest member after Carrie Underwood and Josh Turner.\\r\\nOn June 10, 2006, Bentley released his third album, Long Trip Alone. The album produced two No. 1 hits, \\"Every Mile a Memory\\"[7] in 2006 and \\"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)\\"[7] in 2007. The title track reached No. 10 on the country charts.[7] The fourth single from the album, \\"Trying to Stop Your Leaving,\\" peaked at No. 5.[7]\\r\\nIn 2007, Bentley released a live DVD titled Live and Loud at the Fillmore, which was filmed in Denver, Colorado.\\r\\nIn a March 2008 interview, Bentley said he would let his fans be the executive producers of his first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits/Every Mile a Memory 2003ÿ2008. The album was released on May 6, 2008.[9] An album cut, \\"Sweet & Wild,\\" reached No. 51 on the Hot Country Songs chart.[7] The song was an uncredited duet with fellow country singer Sarah Buxton.\\r\\nBentley's fourth [10] studio album, Feel That Fire,[11] was released in February 2009. Its title track, co-written by Brett Beavers and The Warren Brothers, reached top 40 in October 2008 and became his sixth number one[7] in February 2009. The second single from the album, \\"Sideways,\\" was released on March 2, 2009 and went on to become his seventh number one[7] in the summer of 2009. The album's third and final single, \\"I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes,\\" was released on September 13, and peaked at No. 2.[7]\\r\\nBentley released his sixth studio album, Up on the Ridge, on June 8, 2010. The title track was released to iTunes on April 20, 2010. The song peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart[7] and became Bentley's first single to miss the top 10 since \\"My Last Name.\\" The album's second single, \\"Draw Me a Map,\\" was released to radio on August 23, 2010 and peaked at No. 33.[7]\\r\\nBentley's seventh album, Home, was released on February 7, 2012, led by the single, \\"Am I the Only One\\" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Country Singles.[7][12][13] The second single off the album is \\"Home\\", which was co-written by Bentley, Brett Beavers, and Dan Wilson (musician) also reached No. 1[7] on March 24, 2012. A third single, \\"5-1-5-0\\", was released shortly after \\"Home\\" fell from number one on the country chart.[7] Dierks has been quoted by American Songwriter explaining I wrote too many songs. I wrote 70. I wrote a lot. Theres 64 that are never going to see the light of day. Thats 64 days that I cant get back.[14]\\r\\nOn August 21, 2012, Bentley released the Country & Cold Cans EP on iTunes. It includes five songs, including a radio edit of the track \\"Tip It On Back\\" from his album Home. Bentley paid for the studio time to record the EP himself.[15] On October 23, Bentley and Miranda Lambert announced the co-headlined 33-show Locked and Reloaded Tour, that began on January 17, 2013.[16]\\r\\nBentley's eighth album, Riser, was released on February 25, 2014.[17] The album's first single, \\"Bourbon in Kentucky\\", was released to country radio on June 10, 2013. It peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart,[18] becoming Bentley's lowest charting single to date. The album's second single, \\"I Hold On\\", was released on August 26, 2013. It became his first number one on the Country Airplay chart[18] in April 2014 and also his eleventh overall to do so. The third single, \\"Drunk on a Plane\\", followed that same month. It reached number one on Country Airplay in August 2014 and was also a strong commercial hit, reaching number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100.[7] The album's fourth single, \\"Say You Do\\", was released on October 6, 2014. It reached at number one on Country Airplay in May 2015. The title track became the album's fifth single in June 2015.\\r\\nBentley along with Eric Paslay are featured on Charles Kelley's debut solo single, \\"The Driver\\" which was released on September 28, 2015. The song received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.[19]\\r\\nBentley released his ninth album, Black, on May 27, 2016.[20] The album's first single, \\"Somewhere on a Beach\\", was released on January 25, 2016.[21]\\r\\nBentley co-hosted the 51st Academy of Country Music Awards on April 3, 2016, where he was also nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year and Video of the Year.[22]\\r\\nBentley has begun releasing a series of four short films for songs from Black, with episode one being the song \\"I'll Be the Moon\\" featuring Maren Morris. The following episode serves as the video for \\"What the Hell Did I Say\\".[23] The album's second single, \\"Different for Girls\\" featuring Elle King, was released to country radio on June 6, 2016.[24] It reached at number one on Country Airplay in October 2016. The album's title track was released to country radio as the third single on November 14, 2016.[25]\\r\\nHe was also selected as one of 30 artists to perform on \\"Forever Country\\", a mash-up track of Take Me Home, Country Roads, On the Road Again and I Will Always Love You which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.[26]\\r\\nBentley married Cassidy Black on December 17, 2005, in Mexico.[27] They live in Nashville, with their dogs Jake (who has appeared in a few of Dierks' album covers and videos (died July 10, 2016)) and George.[28] The couple have two daughters, born in 2008 and 2010,[29][30] and a son born in 2013.[citation needed] The oldest child makes a vocal appearance on the song \\"Thinking of You.\\" [31] Their son Knox was born on October 9, 2013.\\r\\nOn June 2, 2012, Bentley announced his father had died the previous day.[citation needed]\\r\\nBentley holds a private pilot license and owns a Cirrus SR22.[32]","input":"Where did dierks bentley go to high school?"},{"output":"80 minutes","context":"The Cape MayÿLewes Ferry is a ferry system in the United States, that traverses a 17-mile (27?km) crossing of the Delaware Bay to connect North Cape May, New Jersey with Lewes, Delaware. The ferry constitutes a portion of U.S. Route 9, and is the final crossing of the Delaware River-Delaware Bay waterway before it meets the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cape MayÿLewes Ferry, operated by the Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA), consists of three ferry vessels and two terminal facilities. Its operations are based at its Cape May terminal, which is actually located in North Cape May, on the north shore of the Cape May Canal.\\r\\nThe three vessels in the fleet carry both vehicles (passenger cars, buses, RVs, tractor trailers, motorcycles, and bicycles) and foot passengers. Each has a capacity of about 100 cars, selling out in advance during the popular summer weekends (although passenger capacity usually does not). Advance reservations are accepted.\\r\\nThe ferry trip takes approximately 80 minutes[1] and provides a view of three lighthouses: the Cape May Light in New Jersey, and the Harbor of Refuge Light and Delaware Breakwater East End Light near Lewes.\\r\\nThe ferry's terminal buildings were substantially overhauled in 2000ÿ01. A new Cape May terminal replaced the existing structure, built in 1988. The Lewes terminal, also built in 1988, was expanded and renovated at the same time. Both terminals now feature unique, recognizable \\"towers,\\" which contain elevators and staircases connecting the terminal buildings to glass-enclosed walkways. The walkways allow foot passengers to board the vessel directly on the second deck, avoiding vehicles driving onto the car deck below.\\r\\nThe terminal buildings feature gift shops, food courts, bars, restaurants, ticketing and information booths, and occasional history or art exhibits.\\r\\nThe original fleet of four steamships and two diesel-powered ships was purchased in 1964 from the defunct Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry in Virginia, replaced by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. Those ships were the SS Cape May (originally the SS Delmarva), the SS Delaware (originally the SS Pocahontas), the SS New Jersey (originally the SS Princess Anne), the MV Cape Henlopen (originally the SS Virginia Beach) and later in 1964, the MV Atlantic (originally the MV Old Point Comfort) (this vessel was sold at the end of 1966).[2] The four remaining ships were replaced beginning in 1974 with new, diesel-powered vessels. The three original vessels of the new fleet, the MV Delaware, MV New Jersey, and MV Twin Capes, were supplemented by the MV Cape Henlopen (originally named New Del) in 1981 and the MV Cape May in 1985. Although these five vessels would later differ in external appearance, they were originally designed and built to identical specifications. Renovation projects in the mid- to late-1990s radically altered the shapes and appearances of the fleet. However, the vessels were only rebuilt from the hull up, meaning that their hulls and power plant remain identical.\\r\\nEach vessel consists of an open car deck situated atop a hull that is low to the water. Because of the ships' shallow displacements, the ships appear almost barge-like, sitting directly atop the water, from a distance. The ships were originally built with two decks atop the car deckthe second deck consisting of a gift shop, caf, and interior and exterior seating areas, and the third deck consisting of outdoor seating areas. Historically, an interior crew room was situated on the third deck, and a pilot house was on the fourth deck. Subsequent renovations changed these plans on some of the vessels.\\r\\nEach vessel can hold 100 cars and 800 passengers. All have a length of 320 feet (98?m) and a breadth of 68 feet (21?m), a displacement of at least 2100 tons, a maximum draft of 7 feet (2.1?m), two 4,000 horsepower (3,000?kW) diesel engines, and a top speed of 16 knots (30?km/h) (18?mph).[2]\\r\\nThe MV Delaware was the first of the original three vessels of the new 1970s fleet. Christened in June 1974 she is the flagship of the fleet. The Delaware has undergone several renovations and refurbishments. The first in 1994 added an additional passenger lounge on the third deck which included a deli and an outdoor bar with refurbishments to her main passenger lounge on the second deck. New \\"shark fin\\" smokestacks were added in 1997 replacing her original stacks. A renovation in 2001 resulted in her second and third decks being extended forward and aft and the outdoor bar moved behind the stacks along with renovations to both interior spaces. A third renovation in 2013 reconfigured the interior space on the second deck.\\r\\nThe MV New Jersey is the second of the original three vessels of the new 1970s fleet, christened in November 1974. A outdoor canopy was added to the third deck in 1996 and in 1999 she received upgraded finishes and seating to the interior passenger lounge. Her main passenger lounge was recently renovated in 2013 with new carpeting and seating.\\r\\nThe MV Cape Henlopen, the fourth vessel of the fleet built in 1981 was christened New Del in July 1981. The vessel was renamed Cape Henlopen in 1984. She received new outdoor seating and a canopy along with new indoor seating in 1998. A recent refurbishment in 2012 resulted in new interior lighting, flooring, seating and climate control.\\r\\nThe MV Cape May, which was the newest vessel of the fleet christened in May 1985, was refurbished in 1998 in a $20 million project that retained the original superstructure and added deck extensions and a new fourth deck. The renovation added a fourth-deck buffet restaurant, bars, an enlarged gift shop, an elevator, and additional interior seating. In 2007, in order to help close an operating deficit, the DRBA removed the Cape May from service and announced that the vessel was up for sale. The vessel's added expense of operation and low useit had made only fifteen crossings in 2007were additional factors leading to its removal from service.[3] The owners of Cross Sound Ferry in Connecticut had shown interest in purchasing the ferry. In 2013, the Cape May was sold to Northstar Marine Services for $750,000, to be converted to a support vessel for offshore wind farms.[4]\\r\\nThe MV Twin Capes is one of the original three vessels of the 1970s fleet, christened in May 1975. She was extensively renovated in a $27 million project between 1994 and 1996 resulting in the original superstructure on and above the second deck removed, the second deck extended forward and aft, and a new superstructure with four new decks, multiple lounges, new pilot house and \\"shark fin\\" smokestacks added. The vessel was then marked as a miniature cruise ship, complete with two sets of elevators, a sweeping interior staircase, interior areas on four different decks, an enlarged retail shop, a food court with a brick pizza oven, four different bars, and a buffet restaurant in a two-deck-tall, glass-enclosed atrium. Although the restaurant was shut down in 2000 after U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors found numerous violations in the galleys of all five vessels, the ship remained an attraction. Her sister ship is the MV Delaware. In July 2010, due to decreasing ridership, the DRBA announced that the vessel was for sale.[5] The \\"Twin Capes\\" was taken out of service and retired in October 2013. On July 20, 2017, the \\"Twin Capes\\" was towed out of the Cape May Terminal to be stripped before a planned sinking as an artificial reef in 2018.[6]\\r\\nService began on July 1, 1964, utilizing a fleet of five ships purchased from Virginia as mentioned above. Those ships had previously provided service across the Chesapeake Bay, connecting Cape Charles with Virginia Beach, but the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in 1964 rendered that service obsolete. All of the steamers were replaced in the 1970s with the service's current fleet.\\r\\nWhen it began service, the Cape MayÿLewes Ferry operated under a 24-hour schedule. That schedule was cut back in 1975 to 16 hours per day.[7]\\r\\nThe ferry was constructed with transportation as its chief goal. However, over time, the Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) began to recognize its potential as a tourist attraction. While the ferry of today continues to provide a vital transportation link between Delaware and New Jersey, the ferry experience has been optimized to draw in tourists.\\r\\nThe ferry fleet was substantially overhauled during the 1990s, adding several amenitiesincluding buffet restaurants, bars, and loungesintended to promote the ride as a draw in itself. The DRBA operates a shuttle service on both sides of the bay in the summer months, giving foot passengers both a ride on the ferry and round-trip transportation from the terminals into Cape May and Lewes for one combined rate. In New Jersey, the shuttle connects the ferry to the Cape May Welcome Center in downtown Cape May. In Delaware, the shuttle operates from the ferry to the Tanger Outlets and the park and ride lot in Rehoboth Beach. DART First State operates the Route 204 bus which connects the ferry terminal with downtown Lewes and the Lewes Transit Center park and ride, where transfers can be made to DART First State's Beach Bus routes that serve the Delaware Beaches and provide connections to Ocean City Transportation's Coastal Highway Beach Bus in Ocean City, Maryland.[8] The DRBA also operates a shuttle bus that links the ferry to the Cape May County Park & Zoo on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays from late June to the end of August and to the Tree to Tree Aerial adventure park at the zoo Sundays through Thursdays from late May to late September. The Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts operates trolley tours of Cape May from the ferry terminal from late June to the end of August, with the Cape May Lighthouse tour operating on Mondays and the Emlen Physick Estate tour operating on Wednesdays. On Wednesdays from June to September, Lucky Sevens Tours operates a coach bus that connects the ferry in Cape May to the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City; the package includes round-trip ferry service, round-trip coach service, and free play for slots.[9] The DRBA has partnered with local merchants to give discounts to passengers, allowing passengers to purchase a round-trip ticket and not disembark midway.\\r\\nIn addition to these promotions, the ferry also offers special holiday excursions. A popular, but expensive, excursion includes the annual fireworks cruise, in which passengers board the vessel (usually the MV Twin Capes) and sail into the bay to watch a Fourth of July fireworks show sponsored by the DRBA. The cruise features entertainment on the car deck (past entertainment has included a symphony orchestra) and a catered meal.\\r\\nThe ferry is a connection between the south Jersey Shore towns from Long Beach Island to Cape May, and the Delaware Beaches and Ocean City, Maryland on the Delmarva Peninsula. Prior to its inception, travelers between these areas needed to drive across southern New Jersey to the Delaware Memorial Bridge, and then down through Delaware on U.S. Route 13, or vice versa if they were coming from Delaware.\\r\\nOn the evening of December 10, 2009, the New Jersey ran aground on a sandbar near the mouth of the Cape May Canal, during an unusually low tide. The ferry was freed by a rising tide and did not suffer any structural damage.[10]\\r\\nCoordinates: 385240N 750344W? / ?38.87764N 75.06226W? / 38.87764; -75.06226","input":"How long is the ferry ride from cape may to lewes?"},{"output":"Curtis Emerson LeMay","context":"World War II\\r\\nCurtis Emerson LeMay (November 15, 1906 ÿ October 1, 1990) was a general in the United States Air Force and the vice presidential running mate of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace in the 1968 presidential election. LeMay is credited with designing and implementing an effective, but also controversial, systematic strategic bombing campaign in the Pacific theater of World War II. He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force from 1961 to 1965.\\r\\nLeMay joined the United States Army Air Corps while studying civil engineering at Ohio State University. He had risen to the rank of major by the time of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. He commanded the 305th Operations Group and the 3d Air Division in the European theatre of World War II from October 1942 to August 1944, when he was transferred to the China Burma India Theater. He was then placed in command of strategic bombing operations against Japan, planning and executing a massive fire bombing campaign against Japanese cities and a crippling minelaying campaign in Japan's internal waterways.\\r\\nAfter the war, he was assigned to command USAF Europe and coordinated the Berlin airlift. He served as commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) from 1948 to 1957, where he presided over the transition to an all-jet aircraft force that focused on the deployment of nuclear weapons. As Chief of Staff of the Air Force, he called for the bombing of Cuban missile sites during the Cuban Missile Crisis and sought a sustained bombing campaign against North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\\r\\nAfter retiring from the Air Force in 1965, LeMay agreed to serve as pro-segregation Governor George Wallace's running mate in the 1968 presidential election. The ticket won 13.5% of the popular vote, a strong tally for a third party campaign, but the Wallace campaign came to see LeMay as a liability. After the election, LeMay retired to his Newport Beach, California home and died in 1990.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeMay was born in Columbus, Ohio, on November 15, 1906. LeMay was of English and distant French Huguenot heritage.[2] His father, Erving Edwin LeMay, was at times an ironworker and general handyman, but he never held a job longer than a few months. His mother, Arizona Dove (Carpenter) LeMay,[3] did her best to hold her family together. With very limited income, his family moved around the country as his father looked for work, going as far as Montana and California. Eventually they returned to his native city of Columbus. LeMay attended Columbus public schools, graduating from Columbus South High School, and studied civil engineering at Ohio State University. Working his way through college, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. While at Ohio State he was a member of the National Society of Pershing Rifles and the Professional Engineering Fraternity Theta Tau. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Corps Reserve in October 1929. He received a regular commission in the United States Army Air Corps in January 1930. While finishing at Ohio State, he took flight training at Norton Field in Columbus, in 1931ÿ32.[4] On June 9, 1934, he married Helen Estelle Maitland (died 1992), with whom he had one child, Patricia Jane LeMay Lodge, known as Janie.[5][6]\\r\\nLeMay became a pursuit pilot and, while stationed in Hawaii, became one of the first members of the Air Corps to receive specialized training in aerial navigation. In August 1937, as navigator under pilot and commander Caleb V. Haynes on a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, he helped locate the battleship Utah despite being given the wrong coordinates by Navy personnel, in exercises held in misty conditions off California, after which the group of B-17s bombed it with water bombs. For Haynes again, in May 1938 he navigated three B-17s over 610 miles (980?km) of the Atlantic Ocean to intercept the Italian liner Rex to illustrate the ability of land-based airpower to defend the American coasts. In 1940 he was navigator for Haynes on the prototype Boeing XB-15 heavy bomber, flying a survey from Panama over the Galapagos islands.[7] War brought rapid promotion and increased responsibility.\\r\\nWhen his crews were not flying missions, they were subjected to relentless training, as LeMay believed that training was the key to saving their lives. \\"You train as you fight\\" was one of his cardinal rules. It expressed his belief that, in the chaos, stress, and confusion of combat (aerial or otherwise), troops or airmen would perform successfully only if their individual acts were second-nature, performed nearly instinctively due to repetitive training. Throughout his career, LeMay was widely and fondly known among his troops as \\"Old Iron Pants,\\" and the \\"Big Cigar\\".[1][8]\\r\\nWhen the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, LeMay was a major in the United States Army Air Forces (he had been a first lieutenant as recently as 1940), and the commander of a newly created B-17 Flying Fortress unit, the 305th Bomb Group. He took this unit to England in October 1942 as part of the Eighth Air Force, and led it in combat until May 1943, notably helping to develop the combat box formation.[9][10] In September 1943, he became the first commander of the newly formed 3rd Air Division. He personally led several dangerous missions, including the Regensburg section of the Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission of August 17, 1943. In that mission, he led 146 B-17s to Regensburg, Germany, beyond the range of escorting fighters, and, after bombing, continued on to bases in North Africa, losing 24 bombers in the process.[9][10]\\r\\nThe heavy losses in veteran crews on this and subsequent deep penetration missions in the autumn of 1943 led the Eighth Air Force to limit missions to targets within escort range. Finally, with the deployment in the European theater of the P-51 Mustang in January 1944, the Eighth Air Force gained an escort fighter with range to match the bombers.[11]\\r\\nIn a discussion of a report into high abort rates in bomber missions during World War II, which Robert McNamara suspected was because of pilot fear of death, Robert McNamara described LeMay's character:\\r\\nOne of the commanders was Curtis LeMayColonel in command of a B-24  [sic] group. He was the finest combat commander of any service I came across in war. But he was extraordinarily belligerent, many thought brutal. He got the report. He issued an order. He said, 'I will be in the lead plane on every mission. Any plane that takes off will go over the target, or the crew will be court-martialed.' The abort rate dropped overnight. Now that's the kind of commander he was.[12]\\r\\nIn August 1944, LeMay transferred to the China-Burma-India theater and directed first the XX Bomber Command in China and then the XXI Bomber Command in the Pacific. LeMay was later placed in charge of all strategic air operations against the Japanese home islands.[9][10]\\r\\nLeMay soon concluded that the techniques and tactics developed for use in Europe against the Luftwaffe were unsuitable against Japan. His Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers flying from China were dropping their bombs near their targets only 5% of the time. Operational losses of aircraft and crews were unacceptably high owing to Japanese daylight air defenses and continuing mechanical problems with the B-29. In January 1945, LeMay was transferred from China to relieve Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell as commander of the XXI Bomber Command in the Marianas.[9][10]\\r\\nHe became convinced that high-altitude precision bombing would be ineffective, given the usually cloudy weather over Japan. Furthermore, bombs dropped from the B-29s at high altitude (above 20,000 feet (6,100?m)) were often blown off of their trajectories by a consistently powerful jet stream over the Japanese home islands, which dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the high-altitude raids. Because Japanese air defenses made daytime bombing below jet stream-affected altitudes too perilous, LeMay finally switched to low-altitude nighttime incendiary attacks on Japanese targets, a tactic senior commanders had been advocating for some time.[9][10] Japanese cities were largely constructed of combustible materials such as wood and paper. Precision high-altitude daylight bombing was ordered to proceed only when weather permitted or when specific critical targets were not vulnerable to area bombing. General LeMay was informed by a senior staff member, Colonel William P. Fisher, that bomber pilots were turning back from these low altitude bombing runs due to heavy anti-aircraft fire from Japanese defense forces. Fisher suggested to LeMay that crews who achieved successful strike rates should be rewarded by being released from their deployment. LeMay implemented this unorthodox plan and the strike rate went up to eighty percent.[13]\\r\\nLeMay commanded subsequent B-29 Superfortress combat operations against Japan, including massive incendiary attacks on 64 Japanese cities. This included the firebombing of Tokyo  known in official documents as the \\"Operation Meetinghouse\\" air raid on the night of March 9ÿ10, 1945  which proved to be the single most destructive bombing raid of the war.[14] For this first attack, LeMay ordered the defensive guns removed from 325 B-29s, loaded each plane with Model M-47 incendiary clusters, magnesium bombs, white phosphorus bombs, and napalm, and ordered the bombers to fly in streams at 5,000 to 9,000 feet (1,500 to 2,700?m) over Tokyo.[9][10][15]\\r\\nThe first pathfinder airplanes arrived over Tokyo just after midnight on March 10 and marked the target area with a flaming \\"X\\". In a three-hour period, the main bombing force dropped 1,665 tons of incendiary bombs, killing 100,000 civilians, destroying 250,000 buildings, and incinerating 16 square miles (41?km2) of the city. Aircrews at the tail end of the bomber stream reported that the stench of burned human flesh permeated the aircraft over the target.[16]\\r\\nPrecise figures are not available, but the firebombing campaign against Japan, directed by LeMay between March 1945 and the Japanese surrender in August 1945, may have killed more than 500,000 Japanese civilians and left five million homeless.[17] Official estimates from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey put the figures at 220,000 people killed.[14] Some 40% of the built-up areas of 66 cities were destroyed, including much of Japan's war industry.[14][18]\\r\\nLeMay was aware of the implication of his orders. The New York Times reported at the time, \\"Maj. Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, commander of the B-29s of the entire Marianas area, declared that if the war is shortened by a single day, the attack will have served its purpose\\".[9][10] The argument was that it was his duty to carry out the attacks in order to end the war as quickly as possible, sparing further loss of life. He also remarked that had the U.S. lost the war, he fully expected to be tried for war crimes.[19] This opinion was also reported by Robert McNamara.[20]\\r\\nPresidents Roosevelt and Truman supported LeMay's strategy, referring to an estimate of one million Allied casualties if Japan had to be invaded. Japan had intentionally decentralized 90% of its war-related production into small subcontractor workshops in civilian districts, making remaining Japanese war industry largely immune to conventional precision bombing with high explosives.[21]\\r\\nAs the firebombing campaign took effect, Japanese war planners were forced to expend significant resources to relocate vital war industries to remote caves and mountain bunkers, reducing production of war materiel. As a lieutenant colonel who served under LeMay, Robert McNamara was in charge of evaluating the effectiveness of American bombing missions. Later, McNamara, as United States Secretary of Defense under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, often clashed with LeMay.\\r\\nLeMay also oversaw Operation Starvation, an aerial mining operation against Japanese waterways and ports that disrupted Japanese shipping and logistics. Although his superiors were unsupportive of this naval objective, LeMay gave it a high priority by assigning the entire 313th Bombardment Wing (four groups, about 160 airplanes) to the task. Aerial mining supplemented a tight Allied submarine blockade of the home islands, drastically reducing Japan's ability to supply its overseas forces to the point that postwar analysis concluded that it could have defeated Japan on its own had it begun earlier.[9][10]\\r\\nLeMay piloted one of three specially modified B-29s flying from Japan to the U.S. in September 1945, in the process breaking several aviation records at that date, including the greatest USAAF takeoff weight, the longest USAAF non-stop flight, and the first ever non-stop JapanÿChicago flight. One of the pilots was of higher rank: Lieutenant General Barney M. Giles. The other two aircraft used up more fuel than LeMay's in fighting headwinds, and they could not fly to Washington, D.C., the original goal.[22] Their pilots decided to land in Chicago to refuel. LeMay's aircraft had sufficient fuel to reach Washington, but he was directed by the War Department to join the others by refueling at Chicago. The order was ostensibly given because of borderline weather conditions in Washington, but according to First Lieutenant Ivan J. Potts who was on board, the order came because LeMay had one fewer general's stars and should not be seen to outperform his superior.[23]\\r\\nAfter World War II, LeMay was briefly transferred to The Pentagon as deputy chief of Air Staff for Research & Development. In 1947, he returned to Europe as commander of USAF Europe, heading operations for the Berlin Airlift in 1948 in the face of a blockade by the Soviet Union and its satellite states that threatened to starve the civilian population of the Western occupation zones of Berlin. Under LeMay's direction, Douglas C-54 Skymasters that could each carry 10 tons of cargo began supplying the city on July 1. By the fall, the airlift was bringing in an average of 5,000 tons of supplies a day with 500 daily flights. The airlift continued for 11 months, with 213,000 flights operated by six countries brought in 1.7 million tons of food and fuel to Berlin. Faced with the failure of its blockade, the Soviet Union relented and reopened land corridors to the West. Though LeMay is sometimes publicly credited with the success of the Berlin Airlift, it was, in fact, instigated by General Lucius D. Clay when General Clay called LeMay about the problem. LeMay initially started flying supplies into Berlin, but then decided that it was a job for a logistics expert and he found that person in Lt. General William H. Tunner,[24] who took over the operational end of the Berlin Airlift.\\r\\nIn 1948, he returned to the U.S. to head the Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Offutt Air Force Base, replacing Gen George Kenney. When LeMay took over command of SAC, it consisted of little more than a few understaffed B-29 bombardment groups left over from World War II. Less than half of the available aircraft were operational, and the crews were undertrained. Base and aircraft security standards were minimal. Upon inspecting a SAC hangar full of US nuclear strategic bombers, LeMay found a single Air Force sentry on duty, unarmed.[25] After ordering a mock bombing exercise on Dayton, Ohio, LeMay was shocked to learn that most of the strategic bombers assigned to the mission missed their targets by one mile or more. \\"We didn't have one crew, not one crew, in the entire command who could do a professional job\\" noted LeMay.[26]\\r\\nA meeting in November 1948 with Air Force Chief of Staff, Hoyt Vandenberg, found the two men agreeing the primary mission of SAC should be the capability of delivering 80% of the nation's atomic bombs in one mission. At the Dualism Conference in December 1948, the Air Force high command rallied behind LeMay's position that the service's highest priority was to deliver the SAC atomic offensive \\"in one fell swoop telescoping mass and time.\\"[27] To LeMay, demolishing everything was how you win a war.[28] Towards this aim, LeMay delivered the first SAC Emergency War Plan in March 1949 which called for dropping 133 atomic bombs on 70 cities in the USSR within 30 days. LeMay predicted that World War III would last no longer than 30 days.[29] Air power strategists called this type of pre-emptive strike \\"killing a nation\\".[30] However, the Harmon committee released their unanimous report two months later stating such an attack would not end a war with the Soviets and their industry would quickly recover. This committee had been specifically created by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to study the effects of a massive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, within weeks, an ad hoc Joint Chiefs committee recommended tripling America's nuclear arsenal, and Chief of Staff Vandenberg called for enough bombs to attack 220 targets, up from the previous 70.[31]\\r\\nUpon receiving his fourth star in 1951 at age 44, LeMay became the youngest four-star general in American history since Ulysses S. Grant and was the youngest four-star general in modern history as well as the longest serving in that rank.[32] In 1956 and 1957 LeMay implemented tests of 24-hour bomber and tanker alerts, keeping some bomber forces ready at all times. LeMay headed SAC until 1957, overseeing its transformation into a modern, efficient, all-jet force. LeMay's tenure was the longest over an American military command in nearly 100 years.[33]\\r\\nGeneral LeMay was instrumental in SAC's acquisition of a large fleet of new strategic bombers, establishment of a vast aerial refueling system, the formation of many new units and bases, development of a strategic ballistic missile force, and establishment of a strict command and control system with an unprecedented readiness capability. All of this was protected by a greatly enhanced and modernized security force, the Strategic Air Command Elite Guard. LeMay insisted on rigorous training and very high standards of performance for all SAC personnel, be they officers, enlisted men, aircrews, mechanics, or administrative staff, and reportedly commented, \\"I have neither the time nor the inclination to differentiate between the incompetent and the merely unfortunate\\".\\r\\nA famous legend often used by SAC flight crews to illustrate LeMay's command style concerned his famous ever-present cigar.[34] In the first known published account of the story, Life Magazine reporter Ernest Havemann related that LeMay once took the co-pilot's seat of a SAC bomber to observe the mission, complete with lit cigar.[35] When asked by the pilot to put the cigar out, LeMay demanded to know why. When the pilot explained that fumes inside the fuselage could ignite the airplane, LeMay reportedly growled, \\"It wouldn't dare\\".[35] The incident in the article was later used as the basis for a fictional scene in the 1955 film Strategic Air Command. In his highly controversial and factually disputed[36][37] memoir War's End, Major General Charles Sweeney related an alleged 1944 incident that may have been the basis for the \\"It wouldn't dare\\" comment.[38]\\r\\nDespite his uncompromising attitude regarding performance of duty, LeMay was also known for his concern for the physical well-being and comfort of his men.[39] LeMay found ways to encourage morale, individual performance, and the reenlistment rate through a number of means: encouraging off-duty group recreational activities,[40][41] instituting spot promotions based on performance, and authorizing special uniforms, training, equipment, and allowances for ground personnel[42] as well as flight crews.\\r\\nOn LeMay's departure, SAC was composed of 224,000 airmen, close to 2,000 heavy bombers, and nearly 800 tanker aircraft.[33]\\r\\nLeMay was appointed Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force in July 1957, serving until 1961.\\r\\nFollowing service as USAF Vice Chief of Staff (1957ÿ1961), LeMay was made the fifth Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on the retirement of Gen Thomas White. His belief in the efficacy of strategic air campaigns over tactical strikes and ground support operations became Air Force policy during his tenure as chief of staff.\\r\\nAs Chief of Staff, LeMay clashed repeatedly with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Air Force Secretary Eugene Zuckert, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army General Maxwell Taylor. At the time, budget constraints and successive nuclear war fighting strategies had left the armed forces in a state of flux. Each of the armed forces had gradually jettisoned realistic appraisals of future conflicts in favor of developing its own separate nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities. At the height of this struggle, the U.S. Army had even reorganized its combat divisions to fight land wars on irradiated nuclear battlefields, developing short-range atomic cannon and mortars in order to win appropriations. The United States Navy in turn proposed delivering strategic nuclear weapons from supercarriers intended to sail into range of the Soviet air defense forces. Of all these various schemes, only LeMay's command structure of SAC survived complete reorganization in the changing reality of Cold War-era conflicts.\\r\\nLeMay was not an enthusiast of the ICBM program, considering ballistic missiles to be little more than toys and no substitute for the strategic nuclear bomber force.\\r\\nThough LeMay lost significant appropriation battles for the Skybolt ALBM and the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress replacement, the North American XB-70 Valkyrie, he was largely successful at expanding Air Force budgets. Despite LeMay's disdain for missiles, he did strongly support the use of military space programs to perform satellite reconnaissance and gather electronic intelligence. For comparison, the US Army and Navy frequently suffered budgetary cutbacks and program cancellations by Congress and Secretary McNamara.\\r\\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, LeMay clashed again with U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Defense Secretary McNamara, arguing that he should be allowed to bomb nuclear missile sites in Cuba. He opposed the naval blockade and, after the end of the crisis, suggested that Cuba be invaded anyway, even after the Soviets agreed to withdraw their missiles. Kennedy secretly agreed to remove US missiles from Turkey and Italy. Unknown to the US, the Soviet field commanders in Cuba had been given authority to launch nuclear weapons under their controlthe only time such authority was delegated by higher command.[30] They had at least 20 nuclear warheads for medium-range R-12 Dvina (NATO Code SS-4 Sandal) ballistic missiles capable of reaching US cities (including Washington DC), each carrying a one megaton warhead (equivalent to 50 Hiroshima bombs), and nine tactical nuclear missiles. A Soviet submarine flotilla in the area commanded by Kapitan (later Vice Admiral) Vasili Arkhipov had nuclear torpedoes. Because a US Navy surface flotilla was harassing the Soviet submarines with small depth charges, both the flagship's captain and its Zampolit, believing that war had started, voted to fire a nuclear torpedo at the flotilla. But Captain Arkhipov, a veteran of the K-19 disaster, voted to wait and see, thus averting World War III. If the Soviet officers on land and at sea had chosen to launch, many millions of US citizens could have been killed. The ensuing SAC retaliatory thermonuclear strike would have killed roughly one hundred million Soviet citizens. Kennedy refused LeMay's requests, and the naval blockade was successful.[30]\\r\\nThe memorandum from LeMay, Chief of Staff, USAF, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, January 4, 1964, illustrates LeMay's reasons for keeping bomber forces alongside ballistic missiles: \\"It is important to recognize, however, that ballistic missile forces represent both the U.S. and Soviet potential for strategic nuclear warfare at the highest, most indiscriminate level, and at a level least susceptible to control. The employment of these weapons in lower level conflict would be likely to escalate the situation, uncontrollably, to an intensity which could be vastly disproportionate to the original aggravation. The use of ICBMs and SLBMs is not, therefore, a rational or credible response to provocations which, although serious, are still less than an immediate threat to national survival. For this reason, among others, I consider that the national security will continue to require the flexibility, responsiveness, and discrimination of manned strategic weapon systems throughout the range of cold, limited, and general war\\".[43]\\r\\nLeMay's dislike for tactical aircraft and training backfired in the low-intensity conflict of Vietnam, where existing Air Force fighter aircraft and standard attack profiles proved incapable of carrying out sustained tactical bombing campaigns in the face of hostile North Vietnamese antiaircraft defenses. LeMay said, \\"Flying fighters is fun. Flying bombers is important\\".[44] Aircraft losses on tactical attack missions soared, and Air Force commanders soon realized that their large, missile-armed jet fighters were exceedingly vulnerable not only to antiaircraft shells and missiles but also to cannon-armed, maneuverable Soviet fighters.\\r\\nLeMay advocated a sustained strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnamese cities, harbors, ports, shipping, and other strategic targets. His advice was ignored. Instead, an incremental policy was implemented that focused on limited interdiction bombing of fluid enemy supply corridors in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This limited campaign failed to destroy significant quantities of enemy war supplies or diminish enemy ambitions. Bombing limitations were imposed by President Lyndon Johnson for geopolitical reasons, as he surmised that bombing Soviet and Chinese ships in port and killing Soviet advisers would bring the Soviets and Chinese more directly into the war.\\r\\nIn his 1965 autobiography (co-written with MacKinlay Kantor), LeMay is quoted as saying his response to North Vietnam would be to demand that \\"they've got to draw in their horns and stop their aggression, or were going to bomb them back into the Stone Age. And we would shove them back into the Stone Age with Air power or Naval powernot with ground forces\\".[45] LeMay subsequently rejected misquotes of the famous \\"Stone Age\\" quote.[46] Later, in a Washington Post interview LeMay said that \\"I never said we should bomb them back to the Stone Age. I said we had the capability to do it. I want to save lives on both sides\\".[47] Etymologyst Barry Popik cites multiple sources (including interviews with LeMay) for various versions of both quotes from LeMay[48] Nevertheless, the \\"should\\" quote remained part of the LeMay legend, and remains widely attributed to him ever after.[46][49]\\r\\nSome military historians have argued that LeMay's theories were eventually proven correct. Near the war's end in December 1972, President Richard Nixon ordered Operation Linebacker II, a high-intensity Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps aerial bombing campaign, which included hundreds of B-52 bombers that struck previously untouched North Vietnamese strategic targets, including heavy populated areas in Hanoi and Haiphong. Linebacker II was followed by renewed negotiations that led to the Paris Peace Agreement, appearing to support the claim. However, consideration must be given to significant differences in terms of both military objectives and geopolitical realities between 1968 and 1972, including the impact of Nixon's recognition and exploitation of the Sino-Soviet split to gain a \\"free hand\\" in Vietnam and the shift of Communist opposition from an organic insurgency (the Viet Cong) to a conventional mechanized offensive that was by its nature more reliant on industrial output and traditional logistics.[50] In effect, Johnson and Nixon were waging two different wars.\\r\\nOwing to his unrelenting opposition to the Johnson administration's Vietnam policy and what was widely perceived as his hostility to Robert McNamara, LeMay was essentially forced into retirement in February 1965. Moving to California, he was approached by conservatives to challenge moderate Republican Thomas Kuchel for his seat in the United States Senate in 1968, but he declined.[51]\\r\\nFor the 1968 presidential election, LeMay originally supported former Republican Vice President Richard Nixon; he turned down two requests by former Alabama Governor George Wallace to join his newly formed American Independent Party, that year, on the grounds that a third-party candidacy might hurt Nixon's chances at the polls. (By coincidence, Wallace had served as a sergeant in a unit commanded by LeMay during World War II).\\r\\nConsequently LeMay, while being fully aware of Wallace's segregationist platform, decided to throw his support to Wallace and eventually became Wallace's running mate.[49]\\r\\nWallace's staff began to consider LeMay to be \\"politically tone-deaf\\" and the former Air Force General did nothing to diminish the perception of extremism that some American voters had of the Wallace-LeMay ticket.[52]\\r\\nThe \\"bomb them back to the stone age\\" comment received significant publicity but LeMay disclaimed the comment, saying in a later interview: I never said we should bomb them back to the Stone Age. I said we had the capability to do it\\".[47][48]\\r\\nThe Wallace-LeMay AIP ticket received 13.5% of the popular vote, higher than most third party candidacies in the US, and carried five states for a total of 46 electoral votes.[53]\\r\\nLeMay was honored by several countries for his military service. His U.S. military decorations included the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross with two oak leaf clusters, and the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters. He was also a recipient of the French Lgion d'honneur and the On December 7, 1964 the Japanese government conferred on him the First Order of Merit with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun. He was elected to the Alfalfa Club in 1957 and served as a general officer for 21 years.\\r\\nLeMay resided in Newport Beach, California starting in 1969. In 1989, he moved to Air Force Village West, a retirement community for ex-Air Force officers near March Air Force Base in Riverside. He died on October 1, 1990 of complications from a heart attack in the 22nd Strategic Hospital on the grounds of March AFB. He[5][6] is buried in the United States Air Force Academy Cemetery[54] at Colorado Springs, Colorado. His wife Helen (1908ÿ1992) survived him by less than 17 months and was buried next to him.\\r\\nLeMay was a Heathkit customer[55] and active amateur radio operator and held a succession of call signs; K0GRL, K4FRA, and W6EZV. He held these calls respectively while stationed at Offutt AFB, Washington, D.C. and when he retired in California. K0GRL is still the call sign of the Strategic Air Command Memorial Amateur Radio Club.[56] He was famous for being on the air on amateur bands while flying on board SAC bombers. LeMay became aware that the new single sideband (SSB) technology offered a big advantage over amplitude modulation (AM) for SAC aircraft operating long distances from their bases. In conjunction with Heath engineers and Art Collins (W0CXX) of Collins Radio, he established SSB as the radio standard for SAC bombers in 1957.[57][55]\\r\\nLeMay was also a sports car owner and enthusiast (he owned an Allard J2); as the \\"SAC era\\" began to wind down, LeMay loaned out facilities of SAC bases for use by the Sports Car Club of America,[58] as the era of early street races began to die out. He was awarded the Woolf Barnato Award, SCCA's highest award, for contributions to the Club, in 1954.[58] In November 2006, it was announced that General LeMay would be one of the inductees into the SCCA Hall of Fame in 2007.[58]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2010, LeMay was named the exemplar for the United States Air Force Academy class of 2013.[59]\\r\\nIn 1964, LeMay became one of the founding board members of Executive Jet Aviation (EJA) (now called NetJets), along with fellow USAF generals Paul Tibbets and Olbert Lassiter, Washington lawyer and former military pilot Bruce Sundlun, and entertainers James Stewart and Arthur Godfrey.\\r\\nIt was the first private business jet charter and aircraft management company in the world.\\r\\nJudo's resurgence after the war is due primarily to two individuals, Kyuzo Mifune and Curtis LeMay. The pre-war death of Jigor Kan (\\"the father of Judo\\"), wartime demands on the Japanese, their surrender, postwar occupation, and the martial-arts ban,[60] all contributed to a time of uncertainty for Judo. As assistant to General Douglas MacArthur during the occupation of Japan, LeMay made practicing Judo a routine part of Air Force tours of duty in Japan. Many Americans brought home stories of a \\"tiny old man\\" (Mifune) throwing down healthy, young men without any apparent effort. LeMay became a promoter of Judo's training and provided political support for Judo in the early years after the war. For this, he was awarded the unique rank of Shihan. In addition, LeMay promoted Judo within the armed forces of the United States. [61]\\r\\nCurtis LeMay held the following ranks over the course of his Air Force career.[62] LeMays first contact with military service occurred in September 1924 when he enrolled as a student in the Army ROTC program at Ohio State University. By his senior year, LeMay was listed on the ROTC rolls as a \\"cadet lieutenant colonel\\". On June 14, 1928, the summer before the start of his senior year, LeMay accepted a commission as a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery Reserve of the U.S. Army. In September 1928, LeMay was approached by the Ohio National Guard and asked to accept a state commission, also as a second lieutenant, which LeMay accepted.\\r\\nOn September 29, 1928, LeMay enlisted in the Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet. For the next 13 months, he was on the enlisted rolls of the Regular Army as a cadet and he held commissions in the National Guard and Army Reserve. His status changed on October 2, 1929, when LeMays Guard and Reserve commissions were terminated. These commissions were revoked after an Army personnel officer, realizing that LeMay was holding officer and enlisted status simultaneously, called him to discuss the matter and LeMay verbally resigned these commissioned ranks over the telephone.[63]\\r\\nAll officer commissions were terminated on October 2, 1929, pending completion of flight training and commissioning as an officer in the Army Air Corps.\\r\\nOn October 12, 1929, LeMay finished his flight training and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps Reserve. This was the third time he had been appointed a second lieutenant in just under two years. He held this reserve commission until June 1930, when he was appointed as a Regular Army officer in the Army Air Corps.\\r\\nLeMay experienced slow advancement throughout the 1930s, as did most officers of the seniority-driven Regular Army. At the start of 1940 he was promoted to Captain after serving nearly eleven years in the lieutenant grades. Beginning in 1941, LeMay began to receive temporary advancements in grade in the expanding Army Air Forces and advanced from captain to brigadier general in less than four years; by 1944, he was a major general in the Army Air Forces. When World War II ended, he was appointed to the permanent rank of brigadier general in the Regular Army and then promoted to permanent major general rank (two star) when the Air Force became its own separate branch of service. LeMay was simultaneously appointed to temporary three star general rank in the Air Force and promoted to the full rank of general, permanent in the Air Force, in 1951. LeMay held this rank until his retirement in 1965.\\r\\nCurtis LeMay retired from the United States Air Force on February 1, 1965 with the rank of full (four star) general.[64]\\r\\nFurther promotions\\r\\nAccording to letters in LeMay's service record, while he was in command of SAC during the 1950s several petitions were made by Air Force service members to have LeMay promoted to the rank of General of the Air Force (five stars). The Air Force leadership, however, felt that such a promotion would lessen the prestige of this rank, which was seen as a wartime rank to be held only in times of extreme national emergency.\\r\\nPer the Chief of the Air Force General Officers Branch, in a letter dated February 28, 1962:\\r\\nIt is clear that a grateful nation, recognizing the tremendous contributions of the key military and naval leaders in World War II, created these supreme grades as an attempt to accord to these leaders the prestige, the clear-cut leadership, and the emolument of office befitting their service to their country in war. It is the conviction of the Department of the Air Force that this recognition was and is appropriate. Moreover, appointments to this grade during periods other than war would carry the unavoidable connotation of downgrading of those officers so honored in World War II.\\r\\nThus, no serious effort was ever made to promote LeMay to the rank of General of the Air Force, and the matter was eventually dropped after his retirement from active service in 1965.\\r\\nLeMay received recognition for his work from thirteen countries, receiving two badges and thirty-two different medals and decorations.","input":"Which u.s. general was the architect of the berlin airlift?"},{"output":"a temperate Oceanic climate with a mild summer, cool winter, and regular moderate rainfall","context":"Christchurch (/?kra?st???rt?/; Mori: tautahi) is the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand and the seat of the Canterbury Region. The Christchurch urban area lies on the South Island's east coast, just north of Banks Peninsula. It is home to 389,700 residents,[2] making it New Zealand's third most-populous city behind Auckland and Wellington.\\r\\nThe Avon River flows through the centre of the city, with an urban park located along its banks. At the request of the Deans brotherswhose farm was the earliest settlement in the areathe river was named after the River Avon in Scotland, which rises in the Ayrshire hills near to where their grandfather's farm was located.[3]\\r\\nArchaeological evidence has indicated that the Christchurch area was first settled by humans about 1250. Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand. The Canterbury Association, which settled the Canterbury Plains, named the city after Christ Church, Oxford. The new settlement was laid out in a grid pattern centred on Cathedral Square; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area, except for the Pacific to the east and the Port Hills to the south.\\r\\nAgriculture is the historic mainstay of Christchurch's economy. The early presence of the University of Canterbury and the heritage of the city's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries.\\r\\nThe city suffered a devastating series of earthquakes between September 2010 and early 2012, with the worst of them soon after midday on 22 February 2011, in which 185 people were killed and hundreds of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage. By late 2013, 1,500 buildings in the city had been demolished, leading to an ongoing recovery and rebuilding project.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of \\"Christchurch\\" was agreed on at the first meeting of the Canterbury Association on 27 March 1848. It was suggested by founder John Robert Godley, whose alma mater was Christ Church, Oxford.[4]\\r\\nThe Mori name tautahi (\\"the place of Tautahi\\") was adopted in the 1930; originally it was the name of a specific site by the Avon River near present-day Kilmore Street.[5] The site was a seasonal dwelling of Ngi Tahu chief Te Potiki Tautahi, whose main home was Port Levy on Banks Peninsula. Prior to that the Ngi Tahu generally referred to the Christchurch area as Karaitiana,[6] a transliteration of the English word Christian.\\r\\nArchaeological evidence found in a cave at Redcliffs in 1876 has indicated that the Christchurch area was first settled by moa-hunting tribes about 1250 CE. These first inhabitants were thought to have been followed by the Waitaha tribe, who are said to have migrated from the East coast of the North Island in the 16th century. Following tribal warfare, the Waitaha (made of three peoples) were dispossessed by the Ngati Mamoe tribe. They were in turn subjugated by the Ngi Tahu tribe, who remained in control until the arrival of European settlers. Following the purchase of land at Putaringamotu (modern Riccarton) by the Weller brothers, whalers of Otago and Sydney, a party of European settlers led by Herriott and McGillivray established themselves in what is now Christchurch, early in 1840. Their abandoned holdings were taken over by the Deans brothers[7] in 1843 who stayed. The First Four Ships were chartered by the Canterbury Association and brought the first 792 of the Canterbury Pilgrims to Lyttelton Harbour. These sailing vessels were the Randolph, Charlotte Jane, Sir George Seymour, and Cressy. The Charlotte Jane was the first to arrive on 16 December 1850. The Canterbury Pilgrims had aspirations of building a city around a cathedral and college, on the model of Christ Church in Oxford.[8]\\r\\nThe name \\"Christ Church\\" was decided prior to the ships' arrival, at the Association's first meeting, on 27 March 1848. The exact basis for the name is not known. It has been suggested that it is named for Christchurch, in Dorset, England; for Canterbury Cathedral; or in honour of Christ Church, Oxford. The last explanation is the one generally accepted.[9]\\r\\nCaptain Joseph Thomas, the Canterbury Association's Chief Surveyor, surveyed the surrounding area. By December 1849 he had commissioned the construction of a road from Port Cooper, later Lyttelton, to Christchurch via Sumner.[10] However this proved more difficult than expected and road construction was stopped while a steep foot and pack horse track was constructed over the hill between the port and the Heathcote valley, where access to the site of the proposed settlement could be gained. This track became known as the Bridle Path, because the path was so steep that pack horses needed to be led by the bridle.[11] Goods that were too heavy or bulky to be transported by pack horse over the Bridle Path were shipped by small sailing vessels some eight miles (13?km) by water around the coast and up the estuary to Ferrymead. New Zealand's first public railway line, the Ferrymead Railway, opened from Ferrymead to Christchurch in 1863. Due to the difficulties in travelling over the Port Hills and the dangers associated with shipping navigating the Sumner bar, a railway tunnel was bored through the Port Hills to Lyttelton, opening in 1867.[12]\\r\\nChristchurch became a city by royal charter on 31 July 1856, the first in New Zealand. Many of the city's Gothic Revival buildings by architect Benjamin Mountfort date from this period. Christchurch was the seat of provincial administration for the Province of Canterbury, which was abolished in 1876. In 1947, New Zealand's worst fire disaster occurred at Ballantyne's Department Store in the inner city, with 41 people killed in a blaze which razed the rambling collection of buildings.[13] The Lyttelton road tunnel between Lyttelton and Christchurch was opened in 1964.[14] Christchurch hosted the 1974 British Commonwealth Games.\\r\\nOn Saturday 4 September 2010, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Christchurch and the central Canterbury region at 4:35?am. Located near Darfield, west of the city at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2?mi), it caused widespread damage to the city and minor injuries, but no direct fatalities.[16][17][18]\\r\\nNearly six months later on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a second earthquake measuring magnitude 6.3 struck the city at 12:51?pm. It was located closer to the city, near Lyttelton at a depth of 5?km (3?mi).[19] Although lower on the moment magnitude scale than the previous earthquake, the intensity and violence of the ground shaking was measured to be IX (Violent), among the strongest ever recorded globally in an urban area[20] and in total 185 people were killed.[21][22] People from more than 20 countries were among the victims.[23] The city's iconic ChristChurch Cathedral was severely damaged and lost its spire.[24][25] The collapse of the CTV Building resulted in the majority of fatalities. Widespread damage across Christchurch resulted in loss of homes, major buildings and infrastructure. Significant liquefaction affected the eastern suburbs, and the total cost to insurers of rebuilding has been estimated at NZ$20ÿ30?billion.[26][27]\\r\\nOn 13 June 2011 Christchurch was hit by two more large aftershocks. A magnitude 5.6 quake at a depth of 9?km (6?mi) hit at 1:00?pm in the general location of Sumner, Christchurch. This was followed by another quake at magnitude 6.3 with a depth of 6?km (4?mi) at 2:20?pm again in the general location of Sumner, Christchurch. There were no fatalities though it resulted in further liquefaction and building damage.[28]\\r\\nThere were further earthquakes on 23 December 2011; the first, of magnitude 5.8 according to the US Geological Survey, 26?km (16?mi) north-east of the city at a depth of 4.7?km (2.9?mi), at 13:58, followed by several aftershocks and another earthquake of magnitude 6.0 and similar location 80 minutes later, with more aftershocks expected.[29][30] St John Ambulance reported after the two quakes that there were minor injuries at homes and businesses but no serious injuries and few indications of building collapses at the time.[31] Christchurch Airport was briefly closed. There were power and water outages at New Brighton and severe damage to the Parklands region, including roads and footpaths.\\r\\nChristchurch was again rattled awake on 2 January 2012; the first; a magnitude 5.1 struck at 01:27 followed five minutes later by a magnitude 4.2 aftershock; a second larger earthquake struck at 05:45 with a magnitude of 5.5. This caused power outages to the eastern suburbs of Parklands, New Brighton, Shirley, Dallington, Burwood, Spencerville and Richmond; this affected around 10,000 homes.[32]\\r\\n4,558 earthquakes were recorded in the Canterbury region above a magnitude 3.0, from 4 September 2010 to 3 September 2014.[33]\\r\\nFollowing the earthquakes over 1500 buildings in the city had been demolished or partly demolished by September 2013.[34]\\r\\nThe city has been experiencing rapid growth following the earthquakes, with the central city rebuild, which is outlined in the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan, starting to ramp up, and massive growth in the residential sector, with around 50,000 new houses expected to be constructed in the Greater Christchurch area by 2028, as outlined in the Land Use Recovery Plan (LURP).\\r\\nOn 13 February 2017, two bush fires started on the Port Hills. These merged over the next two days and the single very large wild fire extended down both sides of the Port Hill almost reaching Governors Bay in the south-west, and the Westmorland, Kennedys Bush, and Dyers Pass Road almost down to the Sign of the Takahe. Eleven houses were destroyed by fire, over one thousand residents were evacuated from their homes, and over 2,076 hectares (5,130 acres) of land has been burned.[35]\\r\\nChristchurch has a history of involvement in Antarctic explorationÿboth Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton used the port of Lyttelton as a departure point for expeditions, and in the central city there is a statue of Scott sculpted by his widow, Kathleen Scott. Within the city, the Canterbury Museum preserves and exhibits many historic artefacts and stories of Antarctic exploration. Christchurch International Airport serves as the major base for the New Zealand, Italian and United States Antarctic programs.\\r\\nThe International Antarctic Centre provides both base facilities and a museum and visitor centre focused upon current Antarctic activities. The United States Navy and latterly the United States Air National Guard, augmented by the New Zealand and Australian air forces, use Christchurch Airport as take-off for the main supply route to McMurdo and Scott Bases in Antarctica. The Clothing Distribution Center (CDC) in Christchurch, had more than 140,000 pieces of extreme cold weather (ECW) gear for issue to nearly 2,000 US Antarctic Program (USAP) participants in the 2007ÿ08 season.[36]\\r\\nChristchurch lies in Canterbury, near the centre of the east coast of the South Island, east of the Canterbury Plains. It is located near the southern end of Pegasus Bay, and is bounded to the east by the Pacific Ocean coast and the estuary of the Avon and Heathcote Rivers. To the south and south-east the urban portion of the city is limited by the volcanic slopes of the Port Hills separating it from Banks Peninsula. In 2006, Banks Peninsula was incorporated into the city, in effect tripling the city's land area[37] while adding only about 8,000 people to the city's population. To the north the city is bounded by the braided Waimakariri River.\\r\\nChristchurch is one of only eight pairs of cities in the world that have near-exact antipodal cities. Half of these antipodal pairs are in New Zealand and Spain/Moroccoÿwith A Coru?a, Spain as Christchurch's antipode.\\r\\nChristchurch is one of a group of only four cities in the world to have been carefully planned following the same layout of a central city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that embrace the city centre. The first city built with this pattern was Philadelphia. Later came Savannah and Adelaide, before Christchurch.\\r\\nChristchurch has one of the highest-quality water supplies in the world, with its water rated among the purest and cleanest in the world.[38] Untreated, naturally filtered water is sourced, via more than 50 pumping stations surrounding the city, from aquifers emanating from the foothills of the Southern Alps.[39]\\r\\nAt the city's centre is Cathedral Square, surrounding the now-earthquake-damaged ÿ landmark Anglican cathedral, Christ Church. The area around this square and within the Four Avenues of Christchurch (Bealey Avenue, Fitzgerald Avenue, Moorhouse Avenue and Deans Avenue[40]) is considered to be the central business district (CBD) of the city. The central city also has a number of residential areas, including Inner City East, Inner City West, Avon Loop, Moa Neighbourhood and Victoria, but many of the residential buildings in the CBD were demolished following the February 2011 earthquakes. Cathedral Square is located at the crossing of two major central streets, Colombo Street and Worcester Street.\\r\\nCathedral Square, the heart of the city, hosted attractions such as (until the February 2011 earthquake)[41] the Wizard of New Zealand, Ian Brackenbury Channell, and evangelist Ray Comfort; regular market days; free standing food and coffee carts; an aquarium, pubs and restaurants and the city's chief tourist information centre. it is expected that activities in Cathedral Square will increase as the rebuild progresses. The Wizard of New Zealand now operates from New Regent Street.[42]\\r\\nThe central city also includes the pedestrianised sections of Cashel and High streets commonly known pre-earthquakes as 'City Mall'. Refurbished in 2008/09 the mall featured especially designed seating, flower and garden boxes, more trees, paving, and an extension to the central city tram route. The tram route extension was nearly complete when the February 2011 earthquake struck. Following the earthquakes, most buildings in Cashel Mall were demolished. A shopping area called Re:START opened on Cashel Street adjacent to Ballantyne's Department Store in October 2011. The Re:START mall is made of colourful shipping containers that have been converted to house retail stores. The Bridge of Remembrance commemorating war dead stands at the western end of the mall, was repaired rededicated on Anzac Day, Monday 25 April 2016.[43][44]\\r\\nThe Cultural Precinct[45] provided a backdrop to a vibrant scene of ever-changing arts, cultural, and heritage attractions within an area of less than one square kilometre. The Arts Centre, the Canterbury Museum and the Art Gallery are located in the Cultural Precinct. The majority of the activities were free and a printable map was provided. There areas are slowly being reopened follow earthquake repair and strengthening work.\\r\\nIn 2010, the Christchurch City Council released \\"A City For People Action Plan\\", a programme of work through to 2022 to improve public spaces within the central city to entice more inner city residents and visitors. A primary action was to reduce the impact of motorised private vehicles and increase the comfort of pedestrians and cyclists. The plan was based on a report prepared for the council by renowned Danish design firm Gehl Architects. Since the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake Wellington architect Ian Athfield has been selected to re-plan, although many varied suggestions have been promoted for rebuilding the central city.[46][47][48][49]\\r\\nThe Central City, which was fully closed off following 22 February earthquake, opened in stages and was fully reopened in June 2013. There are still some streets closed off due to earthquake damage, infrastructure repair work, and damaged buildings.[50]\\r\\n(clockwise, starting north of the city centre)\\r\\n(clockwise, starting north of the city centre)\\r\\nChristchurch has a temperate Oceanic climate with a mild summer, cool winter, and regular moderate rainfall. It has mean daily maximum air temperatures of 22.5?C (73?F) in January and 11.3?C (52?F) in July.[51] Under the K?ppen climate classification, Christchurch has an oceanic climate (Cfb). Summer in the city is mostly warm but is often moderated by a sea breeze from the Northeast. A record temperature of 41.6?C (107?F) was reached in February 1973. A notable feature of the weather is the nor'wester, a hot f?hn wind that occasionally reaches storm force, causing widespread minor damage to property.[52] Like many cities, Christchurch experiences an urban heat island effect; temperatures are slightly higher within the inner city regions compared to the surrounding countryside.[53]\\r\\nIn winter it is common for the temperature to fall below 0?C (32?F) at night. There are on average 80 days of ground frost per year.[54] Snowfalls occur on average three times per year, although in some years no snowfall is recorded.[55] The coldest temperature recorded was ?7.1?C (19?F) on 18 July 1945, the third lowest recorded temperature of New Zealand's major cities.[55][56]\\r\\nOn cold winter nights, the surrounding hills, clear skies, and frosty calm conditions often combine to form a stable inversion layer above the city that traps vehicle exhausts and smoke from domestic fires to cause smog. While not as bad as smog in Los Angeles or Mexico City, Christchurch smog has often exceeded World Health Organisation recommendations for air pollution.[57] To limit air pollution, the regional council banned the use of open fires in the city in 2006.[58] In 2008 council prohibited the use of woodburners more than 15 years old, while making funding available to upgrade domestic home heating systems.[59]\\r\\nThe area administered by the Christchurch City Council has a population of 375,000 (June 2016),[2] making it the second-largest in New Zealand, and the largest city in the South Island.\\r\\nThe Christchurch urban area at 389,700 is the third-largest in the country by population, after Auckland and Wellington. The urban area differs from the city by including Kaiapoi in the Waimakariri District and Prebbleton in the Selwyn District, while excluding most of the Banks Peninsula.\\r\\nThe following table shows the ethnic profile of Christchurch's population, as recorded in the 2001 and 2006 New Zealand census. The percentages add up to more than 100%, as some people counted themselves as belonging to more than one ethnic group. Figures for 2006 refer to just Christchurch City, not the whole urban area. The substantial percentage drop in the numbers of 'Europeans' was mainly caused by the increasing numbers of people from this group choosing to define themselves as 'New Zealanders'ÿeven though this was not one of the groups listed on the census form.\\r\\nApproximately 62% of the South Island's Pacific Islander community reside in Christchurch and the surrounding Canterbury region, equalling approximately 11,500 people.[66] People of Samoan descent comprise about half the Pacific Islander population.[66] There are also smaller communities of Cook Islanders, Fijians, Niueans, Tokelauans and Tongans residing in the city.[66]\\r\\nThe 2006 Census also provides information about the multilinguality of the region. Of those people in Christchurch City who provided data, 86% spoke one language only, 12% spoke two, and 2% could converse in three or more languages.[68]\\r\\nThe agricultural industry has always been the economic core of Christchurch.[70] The city has long had industry based on the surrounding farming country ÿ part of the original \\"package\\" New Zealand was sold to immigrants as.[71] PGG Wrightson, New Zealand's leading agribusiness, is based in Christchurch.[72] Its local roots go back to Pyne Gould Guinness, an old stock and station agency serving the South Island.[73] Other agribusinesses in Christchurch have included malting, seed development and dressing, wool and meat processing, and small biotechnology operations using by-products from meat works.[70] Dairying has grown strongly in the surrounding areas with high world prices for milk products and the use of irrigation to lift grass growth on dry land. With its higher labour use this has helped stop declines in rural population. Many cropping and sheep farms have been converted to dairying. Conversions have been by agribusiness companies as well as by farmers, many of whom have moved south from North Island dairying strongholds such as Taranaki and the Waikato.\\r\\nCropping has always been important in the surrounding countryside. Wheat and barley and various strains of clover and other grasses for seed exporting have been the main crops. These have all created processing businesses in Christchurch. In recent years, regional agriculture has diversified, with a thriving wine industry springing up at Waipara, and beginnings of new horticulture industries such as olive production and processing. Deer farming has led to new processing using antlers for Asian medicine and aphrodisiacs. The high quality local wine in particular has increased the appeal of Canterbury and Christchurch to tourists.[74]\\r\\nChristchurch is the second largest manufacturing centre in New Zealand behind Auckland, the sector being the second largest contributor to the local economy,[75] with firms such as Anderson's making steel work for bridges, tunnels, and hydro-electric dams in the early days of infrastructure work. Now manufacturing is mainly of light products and the key market is Australia, with firms such as those pioneered by the Stewart family among the larger employers. Before clothing manufacture largely moved to Asia, Christchurch was the centre of the New Zealand clothing industry, with firms such as LWR Industries. The firms that remain mostly design and market, and manufacture in Asia. The city also had five footwear manufacturers, but these have been replaced by imports.\\r\\nIn the last few decades, technology-based industries have sprung up in Christchurch.[76] Angus Tait founded Tait Electronics, a mobile-radio manufacturer, and other firms spun off from this, such as Dennis Chapman's Swichtec. In software, Cantabrian Gil Simpson founded a company that made LINC and Jade programming languages and a management buyout spawned local firm Wynyard Group.\\r\\nThere have also been spin-offs from the electrical department of the University of Canterbury engineering school. These included Pulse Data, which became Human Ware (making reading devices and computers for blind people and those with limited vision) and CES Communications (encryption). The Pulse Data founders had moved from the Canterbury University engineering school to work for Wormald Inc. when they set up Pulse Data through a Management buyout of their division.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn recent times, the University of Canterbury engineering school and computer science department play an important role in supplying staff and research for the technology industries, and the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology provides a flow of trained technicians and engineers. Locally and nationally, the IT sector is known not for its size (the third largest in New Zealand) but for producing innovative and entrepreneurial solutions, products and concepts.[77]\\r\\nTourism is also a significant factor of the local economy. The close proximity of the ski fields and other attractions of the Southern Alps, and hotels, a casino, and an airport that meet international standards make Christchurch a stopover destination for many tourists. The city is popular with Japanese tourists,[78] with signage around Cathedral Square in Japanese.\\r\\nChristchurch's local government is a democracy with various elements including:\\r\\nIn 1993, Christchurch was selected as the \\"Best Run City in the World\\", also known as the 'Carl Bertelsmann Prize: Local Government', by the Bertelsmann Foundation of Germany. Especially noted was the increased efficiency of communal services in competition with private enterprises. Christchurch shared the award honour with Phoenix, Arizona, USA.[81]\\r\\nSome of the local governments in Canterbury and the NZ Transport Agency have created the Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy to facilitate future urban planning.[82]\\r\\nChristchurch is covered by seven general electorates (Christchurch Central, Christchurch East, Ilam, Port Hills, Selwyn, Waimakariri and Wigram) and one Mori electorate (Te Tai Tonga),[83] each returning one member to the New Zealand House of Representatives. The governing National Party holds four of the general electorates, while the opposing Labour Party holds the remainder. In addition, there are a varying number of Christchurch-based list MPs, who are elected via party lists. As of December 2015, there are seven list MPs in the House who contested Christchurch-based electorates at the 2014 election: two each from the National, Green and New Zealand First parties, and one from the Labour Party.\\r\\nChristchurch is home to the fourth largest school in New Zealand, co-educational state school Burnside High School, with 2564 pupils.[84] Cashmere High School, Papanui High School and Riccarton High School are other large schools. There are four single-sex state schools: Shirley Boys' High School, Christchurch Boys' High School, Avonside Girls' High School and Christchurch Girls' High School.\\r\\nChristchurch is also well known for several independent schools and church schools, some of them of the traditional English public school type. These include St Thomas of Canterbury College, St Margaret's College, Christ's College, St Bede's College, Marian College, St Andrew's College, Villa Maria College and Rangi Ruru Girls' School. Less conventional schools in the city include Unlimited Paenga Tawhiti and Hagley Community College.\\r\\nA number of tertiary education institutions have campuses in Christchurch, or in the surrounding areas.\\r\\nChristchurch is served by Christchurch International Airport and by buses (local and long-distance) and trains. The local bus service, known as Metro,[85] is provided by Environment Canterbury. The car, however, remains the dominant form of transport in the city, as with the rest of New Zealand.\\r\\nChristchurch has an extensive bus network with bus routes serving most areas of the city and satellite towns. Nearly all bus routes travelled through the central city Bus Exchange before the earthquake but due to reduced passenger numbers since the earthquakes, especially in the central city, the bus network was reorganised to direct more localised services to 'hubs', such as major shopping centres, where they connect to the central station via core bus routes. Before the 2011 earthquakes, in addition to normal bus services, Christchurch also had a pioneering zero-fare hybrid bus service, the Shuttle, in the inner city. The service has been suspended following the earthquakes and it is unclear whether it will resume again in the future.[86] Bus services are also available leaving Christchurch, daily passenger bus services[87] operates between Dunedin and Christchurch on the State Highway 1.\\r\\nHistorically, Christchurch has been known as New Zealand's cycling city[88] and currently still attracts about 7% of commuters cycling. The central city has very flat terrain and the Christchurch City Council has established a network of cycle lanes and paths, such as the Railway Cycleway. Post-quake public consultation on rebuilding the city expressed a strong desire for a more sustainable transport system, particularly greater use of cycling again, and this has been reflected in the Council's strategic transport plan.[89]\\r\\nThe Christchurch City Council has committed NZ$68.5?million to build a network of modern cycleways over the next five years.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere is a functioning Christchurch tramway system in Christchurch, but as a tourist attraction; its loop is restricted to a circuit of the central city. The trams were originally introduced in 1905 as a form of public transport, and ceased operating in 1954,[90] but returned to the inner city (as a tourist attraction) in 1995. However, following the February 2011 earthquake, the system was damaged and within the cordoned off 'Red Zone' of the central city. The tramway reopened in November 2013 on a limited route, with plans to extend the tram route in 2014, first to reopen the complete pre-earthquake circuit, and then to open the extension travelling through the Re:Start Mall and High Street, which was being constructed when the 2011 earthquake struck.\\r\\nThere is a cable car system called the Christchurch Gondola which operates as a tourist attraction, providing transport from the Heathcote Valley to the top of Mount Cavendish in the city's south-east.\\r\\nRail services, both long-distance and commuter, used to focus on the former railway station on Moorhouse avenue. Commuter trains were progressively cancelled in the 1960s and 1970s. The last such service, between Christchurch and Rangiora, ceased in 1976. After the reduction in services a new Christchurch railway station was established at Addington Junction. The Main North Line railway travels northwards via Kaikoura to Picton and is served by the TranzCoastal passenger train, while the Main South Line heads to Invercargill via Dunedin and was used by the Southerner until its cancellation in 2002. The most famous train to depart Christchurch is the TranzAlpine, which travels along the Main South Line to Rolleston and then turns onto the Midland Line, passes through the Southern Alps via the Otira Tunnel, and terminates in Greymouth on the West Coast. This trip is often regarded as one of the ten great train journeys in the world for the amazing scenery through which it passes. The TranzAlpine service is primarily a tourist service and carries no significant commuter traffic.\\r\\nChristchurch is a distinctly English city, however it contains various European elements, with strong Gothic Revival architecture. As early settlers of New Zealand, Mori culture is also prevalent in the city. It features many public open spaces and parks, river beds and cafs and restaurants situated in the city centre and surrounding suburbs.\\r\\nWhile historically most cinemas were grouped around Cathedral Square,[91] only two cinemas remain there. The Regent complex was rebuilt as 'Regent on Worcester' in 1996. In 2009 Metro Cinemas opened in Worcester Street with three screens.\\r\\nOnly one of the first generation of suburban cinemas, the Hollywood in Sumner, remains open.[92] The largest multiplexes were the Hoyts 8 in the old railway station on Moorhouse Avenue (now demolished) and Reading Cinemas (also eight screens) in the Palms shopping centre in Shirley. Hoyts in Riccarton opened in 2005[93] with one of its screens for a time holding the record for the largest in New Zealand.\\r\\nThe Rialto Cinemas on Moorhouse avenue specialised in international films and art house productions. The Rialto also hosted the majority of the city's various film festivals and was home to the local film society. The Rialto was closed following the February 2011 earthquake.\\r\\nThe Christchurch Arts Centre includes two art house cinemas, Cloisters and The Academy, screening a wide selection of contemporary, classic and foreign language films.\\r\\nThe Canterbury Film Society is active in the city.[94]\\r\\nThe matricidal Peter Jackson film Heavenly Creatures (1994), starring Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, was set in Christchurch.[95]\\r\\nThe large number of public parks and well-developed residential gardens with many trees has given Christchurch the name of The Garden City.[96] Hagley Park and the 30-hectare (75 acre) Christchurch Botanic Gardens, founded in 1863, are in the central city, with Hagley Park being a site for sports such as golf, cricket, netball, and rugby, and for open-air concerts by local bands and orchestras. To the north of the city is the Willowbank wildlife park. Travis Wetland, an ecological restoration programme to create a wetland, is to the east of the city centre in the suburb of Burwood.\\r\\nChristchurch had its own regional television station Canterbury Television. CTV was first formed in 1991 and eased broadcasting on 16 December 2016. It aired both local, national and international content, including DW-TV and Al-jazeera World. Since 19 December 2016 CTV has operated as a web-based platform under the Star Media brand.\\r\\nVTV, a Korean TV channel airs in Christchurch (also Auckland). It offers English content about Korea, from arirang World, and Korean-speaking content in SBS. This channel broadcast many of the latest dramas airing in Korea.\\r\\nThe city's main television transmitter is located atop Sugarloaf, in the Port Hills due south of the city centre, and broadcasts all major national television channels as well as the two local channels. All television channels in Christchurch have been broadcast in digital since analogue switch-off on 28 April 2013.\\r\\nChristchurch has one full-time professional theatre, the Court Theatre,[97] founded in 1971. Originally based in the Christchurch Arts Centre, the Court Theatre has been located in the suburb of Addington in temporary accommodation following the 2011 earthquakes. Alongside the Court, the co-operative and experimental Free Theatre Christchurch was established in 1979 and based in the Arts Centre from 1982.[98] There is also an active recreational theatre scene with community based theatre companies, such as the Christchurch Repertory Society,[99] Elmwood Players,[100] Riccarton Players,[101] and Canterbury Children's Theatre,[102] producing many quality shows. The Ngaio Marsh Theatre, located at the University of Canterbury, hosts a range of student drama groups, as well as other theatre groups. The Isaac Theatre Royal was originally opened in 1863, and has since been rebuilt four times, most recently following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[103] The Isaac Theatre Royal reopened to the public on 17 November 2014.\\r\\nThe city is known for its many live acts,[104][105][106][107] has a professional symphony orchestra,[108] and is the base of professional opera company, Southern Opera.[109] Christchurch is a home for experimental music scene of New Zealand. The town is the home to such bands as The Bats, The Narcs, Shocking Pinks and Bailter Space.\\r\\nThere are usually buskers around the town square and Christchurch also hosts the World Buskers Festival in January each year.[citation needed] Singer/songwriter Hayley Westenra launched her international career by busking in Christchurch. Soon she was signed to Universal Music Group New Zealand, then later to Decca Label Group in London, England, where she now bases her career.\\r\\nChristchurch also has a Metal scene, with metal acts playing in various locations around the central city.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome of New Zealand's acts such as Shapeshifter, Ladi6, Tiki Taane and Truth are from Christchurch. Promoters, Venues and clubs such as Bassfreaks, The Bedford and Dux Live regularly have international and New Zealand acts within the Drum and Bass scene performing live in Christchurch, along with dance parties, raves and gigs all featuring NZ and local Drum and Bass DJs, with often two or three happening on a single night or weekend (e.g. 2010 when UK Dubstep DJ Doctor P with Crushington was playing at The Bedford, while simultaneously Concord Dawn featuring Trei and Bulletproof was playing at Ministry).[citation needed] Independent Christchurch based radio station Pulzar FM is one of the few radio stations in New Zealand that plays Drum and Bass during the day.\\r\\nIn recent movements, hip hop has effectively landed in Christchurch.[clarification needed] In 2000, First Aotearoa Hip Hop Summit was held there. And in 2003, Christchurch's own Scribe released his debut album in New Zealand and has received five times platinum in that country, in addition to achieving two number one singles.[110][111]\\r\\nThe Horncastle Arena is New Zealand's second largest permanent multipurpose arena, seating between 5000 and 8000, depending on configuration. It is home of the Canterbury Tactix netball side. It was the venue for the 1999 World Netball championships and has been host to many concerts in recent years.\\r\\nThe Christchurch Town Hall auditorium (2500 seats, opened 1972) was the first major auditorium design by architects Warren and Mahoney and acoustician Marshall Day. It is still recognised as a model example of concert-hall design with an excellent modern pipe organ. The town hall is currently closed for repair after the significant damage caused by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\\r\\nChristchurch also has a casino,[112] and there are also a wide range of live music venues[104][113]some short-lived, others with decades of history. Classical music concerts are held at the Christchurch Music Centre.\\r\\nIn late 2014 it was announced that a 284 million dollar project was underway to build a convention centre located on the block defined by Armagh Street, Oxford Terrace, Worcester Street and Colombo Street. Gloucester Street will become part of the Centre itself, but will allow for retail use and public access. The convention centre will be able to host several events at the same time; starting with space for up to 2,000 people, this will complement facilities in Auckland and Queenstown. The scheduled opening of the convention centre is uncertain.[114]\\r\\nChristchurch has seven sister cities around the world. They are:[119]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nOfficial organisations\\r\\nCulture and information\\r\\nTourism and maps","input":"What is the climate in christchurch new zealand?"},{"output":"Andy Lassner","context":"The Ellen DeGeneres Show (often shortened to Ellen) is an American television comedy talk show hosted by comedienne/actress Ellen DeGeneres. Debuting on September 8, 2003, it is produced by Telepictures and airs in syndication, including stations owned by NBCUniversal.[2] For its first five seasons, the show was taped in Studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. From season 6 onwards, the show moved to being taped at Stage 1 on the nearby Warner Bros. lot.[3] Since the beginning of the sixth season, Ellen has been broadcast in high definition.\\r\\nThe show has won 59 Daytime Emmy Awards as of 2017, including four for Outstanding Talk Show and six for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment, surpassing the record held by The Oprah Winfrey Show, which won nine. The show also won 17 People's Choice Award. The talk show's YouTube channel is currently charted as being in the top 20 most-subscribed YouTube channels. On January 20, 2016, it was announced that the show had been renewed for three additional seasons through 2020.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program combines comedy, celebrity, musical guests, and human-interest stories. The program often features audience participation games where prizes are awarded. During her Twelve Days of Giveaways promotion, audience members receive roughly $1,000 worth of prizes on each of twelve episodes. Because the show has become so popular, not all who arrive hoping to see a taping can fit into the studio, so an offshoot space, dubbed by Tom Hanks \\"The Riff Raff Room\\", was created. Persons seated here are often referenced and shown briefly on camera but watch the taping from off-stage. Other non-celebrities have been featured in an attempt by DeGeneres to give them 15 minutes of fame. Guests in this role have included intelligent children, small business owners, etc. In the show's third season, DeGeneres began surprising fans by introducing them to their favorite celebrities.\\r\\nSeveral recurring sounds, gags, and catchphrases are used by DeGeneres depending on the topic of discussion or theme for a specific episode. For example, after DeGeneres says the phrase, \\"Aww Snap!\\", a sound effect of a whip cracking often is played. In her monologue, DeGeneres frequently thanks the audience's applause by saying \\"I feel the same way about you!\\" Other video segments include DeGeneres scaring people, playing pranks, taking part in faux-breaking news segments, interacting with crew members, etc. Other recurring segments include those where DeGeneres comments on Internet videos, tabloid-style photographs of celebrities, advertisements on Craigslist, or voicemails left for her on an answering machine. Some segments feature audience members more prominently, including having audience members show hidden talents, pictures of others that resemble DeGeneres, interviewing children, etc.\\r\\nDeGeneres frequently plays games with audience members and awards prizes based upon their performance. Games have included Pictionary-style drawing games, finding hidden objects within the studio, category, current event or pop-culture-based trivia, and various other stunt and charade-based games. DeGeneres also joked several times on the show about when a sequel to Finding Nemo, in which she famously had a lead role, will eventually release, as well as make references to the film. Eventually, the sequel, Finding Dory, was officially announced by DeGeneres.\\r\\nThe show has many recurring segments throughout the years. Some include:\\r\\nHeads Up!\\r\\nHeads Up! is a game that DeGeneres plays with other celebrities. The game originally has players guess the word on the physical cards held to another player's head as time counts down. DeGeneres and Warner Bros. Entertainment developed an app version of this game. The game became a huge success after its May 2013 launch, and it immediately shot to the top of the App Store and was downloaded over 650,000 times in its first month. Totally,it has been download for more than 25 million times by July 2016. It remains among Apple's top-paid apps three years after launch.[5]\\r\\nSince the show's debut, DeGeneres has segued from her opening monologue by doing a dance. The dancing proved to be extremely popular with viewers, and has since progressed to a segment where DeGeneres dances into the audience, sometimes borrowing a coat or purse from someone's chair, and taking it with her. She has also featured a segment in which people teach her new dance moves.\\r\\nOne of her most famous dance moves is dancing over the table, where she straddles the coffee table and dances from one end to the other. Although she does not do it every day, dancing over the table is a recurring theme. As an April Fools' Day prank in 2009, the show's staff placed a wider table top over her normal table. During the show, when DeGeneres attempted to dance over it, she barely made it across, being forced on her tip-toes and using the table as leverage. On the seventh-season premiere, DeGeneres performed a dance segment with the cast of So You Think You Can Dance.\\r\\nIn September 2009, four major record labels sued the producers of the show for unspecified damages over the dance routine, for allegedly using songs without permission.[6]\\r\\nSophia Grace Brownlee (born April 18, 2003[7]) and her cousin Rosie McClelland (born September 7, 2006[8]) were first invited to the show after DeGeneres saw their YouTube video cover of \\"Super Bass\\" by Nicki Minaj, which Sophia Grace and Rosie posted on YouTube on September 19, 2011.[9] The then eight- and five-year-old Essex, England natives became recurring cast members on the show, where they hosted their own segment called \\"Tea Time with Sophia Grace and Rosie\\". In the segment, the duo invites and interviews guest celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Hugh Grant, Julie Bowen, Harry Connick Jr., LL Cool J, Justin Bieber, and Reese Witherspoon over to tea. Sophia Grace and Rosie won the \\"Choice Webstar\\" at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards for this segment. They have also been correspondents during the red carpet events such as the Grammy Awards, the American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and the MTV Video Music Awards. They appeared in the third episode (June 2013) and the eleventh episode (September 2013) of Sam & Cat. According to her representative, Sophia Grace had been cast as Little Red Riding Hood in Walt Disney Pictures' film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods, but she withdrew before production.[10] Sophia Grace & Rosie starred in their own movie called Sophia Grace and Rosie's Royal Adventure.\\r\\nDeGeneres's mother, Betty, attends the show regularly and is frequently featured on camera.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom 2003 to early 2008, the program was originally taped at studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. It is now filmed in studio 1 (named \\"The Ellen Stage\\" since her 2,000th show that took place in November 2015) on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank.\\r\\nThe executive producers are DeGeneres, Mary Connelly, Ed Glavin, Andy Lassner and Jim Paratore. The writing staff has included Karen Kilgariff (former head writer), Karen Anderson, Margaret Smith and DeGeneres. Margaret Smith left the show to work on her own projects, including her first book, What Was I Thinking? How Being a Stand Up Did Nothing to Prepare Me to Become a Single Mother (Crossroad Publishing, 2008). Amy Rhodes, a former writer for the program, regularly appeared on camera during various segments.\\r\\nUnlike most talk shows, the show uses a disc jockey to supply music rather than a band. Originally, the role was filled by Los Angeles-based DJ Scott K, who lasted only a few weeks. He was later replaced by Tony Okungbowa, who DJed through season 3. Due to his growing acting career, Okungbowa left the show, and a few guest DJs were brought in to try out for the position. Tony was replaced by actor/DJ Jon Abrahams for the fourth-season premiere. Abrahams stayed on the show for one season, and also left as his acting career grew. Ted Stryker of KROQ, was the DJ for the fifth season. Stryker stayed for one season until Okungbowa returned. In a recent[when?] episode, DJ Pauly D from Jersey Shore deejayed when Okungbowa was promoting his CD.\\r\\nStarting in season 11, several episodes include celebrity \\"guest DJs\\" filling the DJ position in Okungbowa's absence. The most frequently appearing guest DJs are Stephen \\"tWitch\\" Boss of So You Think You Can Dance fame, and comedian Loni Love.\\r\\nOkungbowa made a return appearance on the show in the April 28, 2014 episode, while Loni made a return in the June 5, 2015 episode.[citation needed]\\r\\nDeGeneres, a member of the Writers Guild of America, supported the 2007 writers' strike.[11] However, on November 9, 2007, DeGeneres crossed the picket line to tape more episodes of her TV show stating:\\r\\nDeGeneres decided to abstain from doing a monologue on her show (which is typically written by WGA writers) during the strike.[12] Her show continued production as normal with the exception of her monologue being omitted. The WGAE issued a statement condemning DeGeneres, stating she was \\"not welcome in NY.\\"[13] DeGeneres's representatives asserted that she did not violate the WGA's agreement, arguing that she is competing with other first-run syndicated shows like Dr. Phil and Live with Regis and Kelly during the competitive November sweeps period, and that DeGeneres must fulfill her duties as host and producer, lest her show lose its time slot or be held in breach of contract. In addition, a statement defending DeGeneres was subsequently issued by AFTRA, pointing out that DeGeneres also works under the AFTRA TV Code, which bars her from striking. The WGAE then issued a response pointing out that DeGeneres is also a Writers Guild member, and that any writing work she did on her show during the strike constituted struck work.[14][15]\\r\\nSeveral episodes have aired with a special theme or format, including a \\"Backwards Show\\", entire episodes themed around Broadway productions, a Thanksgiving special taped in the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, and an entire episode which included Deltalina filmed on a Delta airplane. Other recurring themes feature products from sponsors DeGeneres likes (similar to Oprah's Favorite Things from the now ended The Oprah Winfrey Show), specials following awards show telecasts (such as the Academy Awards), and numerous milestone episodes (e.g., DeGeneres's 1,000th, 1300th, 1500th, etc. broadcast). In 2017, an episode aired commemorating the 20th anniversary of \\"The Puppy Episode\\", the episode of her sitcom Ellen, in which her character Ellen Morgan came out as a lesbian.\\r\\nThe episode titled \\"Sirdeaner Walker Interview\\" was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for \\"Outstanding Talk Show Episode\\" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.[16]\\r\\nOn January 11, 2013, DeGeneres announced that she was going to Australia in March with her wife, Australian actress Portia de Rossi, after having wanted to go for many years, however being unable to visit in summer (which she preferred) due to taping conflicts of her show.[17] Toward the end of the episode, which featured Nicole Kidman as a guest, she announced to the audience that they will also be going on a holiday to Australia in a giveaway special.\\r\\nOn March 3, 2014, DeGeneres hosted the show live, one day after her being the host of the 86th Academy Awards. This episode features this year's Oscar winners Cate Blanchett, Jared Leto and Lupita Nyong'o as guests.\\r\\nOn two occasions, DeGeneres was unable to host the show due to sickness. On January 24, 2014, guest DJ for that day Ellie Kemper filled in to be the first guest host on the show. On September 29, 2016, day four of the 7th Annual Cat Week, Miley Cyrus took over as host.\\r\\nThe show has been met with considerable success, and has won 59 Daytime Emmy Awards by 2017. Additionally, as the show's popularity has increased, the program has appeared in plot elements of storylines in several scripted television programs, including Joey, Six Feet Under and The Bernie Mac Show, among others.\\r\\nThe show averages around 2.9 million viewers per episode, according to daytime television ratings, making it a highly viewed daytime show.[18] It usually only trails behind Live with Kelly, and Dr. Phil in total viewers. By 2017, the show passed Live with Kelly and only trails behind Dr. Phil.[19]\\r\\nThe show has won a total of 59 Daytime Emmy Awards by 2017, including four for Outstanding Talk Show (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007) and six for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment (2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017). The show first fourteen seasons surpassed the record held by The Oprah Winfrey Show,which received 47 Daytime Emmy Awards before Winfrey chose to stop submitting it for consideration in 2000. DeGeneres herself has won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host four times (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008). The show has also won Emmys in numerous writing and technical categories. It won the Genesis Award for \\"Best Talk Show\\" in 2010 and 2012. DeGeneres has won the People's Choice Award for \\"Favorite Daytime TV Host\\" 14 times, making her the most awarded person in the People's Choice Awards's history.[20]","input":"Who is the producer of the ellen degeneres show?"},{"output":"up to 860 volts","context":"Gymnotus electricus\\r\\nThe electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) is a South American electric fish, and the only species in its genus. Despite the name, it is not an eel, but rather a knifefish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe electric eel has an elongated, cylindrical body, typically growing to about 2?m (6?ft 7?in) in length, and 20?kg (44?lb) in weight, making them the largest species of the Gymnotiformes.[2] Their coloration is dark gray-brown on the back and yellow or orange on the belly. Mature females have a darker color on the belly. They have no scales. The mouth is square, and positioned at the end of the snout. The anal fin extends the length of the body to the tip of the tail.\\r\\nAs in other ostariophysan fishes, the swim bladder has two chambers. The anterior chamber is connected to the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the Weberian apparatus, which greatly enhances its hearing capability. The posterior chamber extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fish's buoyancy. E. electricus has a well-developed sense of hearing. This fish has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through epithelial tissue in its buccal cavity.[3] As obligate air-breathers, electric eels must rise to the surface every ten minutes or so to inhale before returning to the bottom. Nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way.[4]\\r\\nDespite its name, the electric eel is not closely related to the true eels (Anguilliformes) but is a member of the neotropical knifefish order (Gymnotiformes), which is more closely related to the catfish.\\r\\nThe electric eel has three pairs of abdominal organs that produce electricity: the main organ, the Hunter's organ, and the Sach's organ. These organs make up four fifths of its body, and give the electric eel the ability to generate two types of electric organ discharges: low voltage and high voltage. These organs are made of electrocytes, lined up so a current of ions can flow through them and stacked so each one adds to a potential difference.[5]\\r\\nWhen the eel finds its prey, the brain sends a signal through the nervous system to the electrocytes.[5] This opens the ion channels, allowing sodium to flow through, reversing the polarity momentarily. By causing a sudden difference in electric potential, it generates an electric current in a manner similar to a battery, in which stacked plates each produce an electric potential difference.[5]\\r\\nIn the electric eel, some 5,000 to 6,000 stacked electroplaques can make a shock up to 860 volts and 1 ampere of current (860 watts) for two milliseconds (ms).[citation needed] Such a shock is extremely unlikely to be deadly for an adult human, due to the very short duration of the discharge. Atrial fibrillation requires that roughly 700 mA be delivered across the heart muscle for 30 ms or more, far longer than the eel can produce.[citation needed] Still, this level of current is reportedly enough to produce a brief and painful numbing shock likened to a stun gun discharge, which due to the voltage can be felt for some distance from the fish; this is a common risk for aquarium caretakers and biologists attempting to handle or examine electric eels.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Sach's organ is associated with electrolocation.[6] Inside the organ are many muscle-like cells, called electrocytes. Each cell can only produce 0.15 V, though the organ can transmit a signal of nearly 10 V overall in amplitude at around 25?Hz in frequency. These signals are emitted by the main organ; the Hunter's organ can emit signals at rates of several hundred hertz.[6]\\r\\nThe electric eel is unique among the Gymnotiformes in having large electric organs that can produce potentially lethal discharges that allow them to stun prey.[7] Larger voltages have been reported, but the typical output is sufficient to stun or deter virtually any animal. Juveniles produce smaller voltages (about 100 V). They can vary the intensity of the electric discharge, using lower discharges for hunting and higher intensities for stunning prey or defending themselves. They can also concentrate the discharge by curling up and making contact at two points along its body.[8] When agitated, they can produce these intermittent electric shocks over at least an hour without tiring.\\r\\nThe electric eel also possesses high frequencyÿsensitive tuberous receptors, which are distributed in patches over its body. This feature is apparently useful for hunting other Gymnotiformes.[6]\\r\\nElectric eels have been used as a model in the study of bioelectrogenesis.[9] The species is of some interest to researchers, who make use of its acetylcholinesterase and adenosine triphosphate.[10][11]\\r\\nMichael Faraday extensively tested the electrical properties of an electric eel, imported from Suriname. For a span of four months, Faraday carefully and humanely measured the electrical impulses produced by the animal by pressing shaped copper paddles and saddles against the specimen. Through this method, Faraday determined and quantified the direction and magnitude of electric current, and proved the animal's impulses were in fact electrical by observing sparks and deflections on a galvanometer.[12]\\r\\nResearchers at Yale University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology argue artificial cells could be built that not only replicate the electrical behavior of electric eel cells, but also improve on them. Artificial versions of the eel's electricity-generating cells could be developed as a power source for medical implants and other microscopic devices.[13]\\r\\nElectric eels inhabit fresh waters of the Amazon and Orinoco River basins in South America, in floodplains, swamps, creeks, small rivers, and coastal plains. They often live on muddy bottoms in calm or stagnant waters.[6]\\r\\nElectric eels feed on invertebrates, although adult eels may also consume fish and small mammals, such as rats. First-born hatchlings eat other eggs and embryos from later clutches.[6] The juveniles eat invertebrates, such as shrimp and crabs.\\r\\nThe electric eel is known for its unusual breeding behavior. In the dry season, a male eel makes a nest from his saliva into which the female lays her eggs. As many as 3,000 young hatch from the eggs in one nest. Males grow to be larger than females[14][15] by about 35?cm (14?in).[16]\\r\\nThese fish have always been sought after by some animal collectors, but catching them is difficult, because the only reasonable option is to make the eels tired by continually discharging their electricity.[citation needed] The fish's electric organs eventually become completely discharged, allowing the collector to wade into the water in comparative safety.[15]\\r\\nKeeping electric eels in captivity is difficult and mostly limited to zoos and aquaria, although a few hobbyists have kept them as pets.\\r\\nThe Tennessee Aquarium in the United States is home to an electric eel. Named Miguel Wattson, the eel's exhibit is wired to a small computer that sends out a prewritten tweet when it emits electricity at a high enough threshold.[17][18]\\r\\nThe species is so unusual that it has been reclassified several times. When originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766, he used the name Gymnotus electricus, placing it in the same genus as Gymnotus carapo (banded knifefish) which he had described several years earlier. It was only about a century later, in 1864, that the electric eel was moved to its own genus Electrophorus by Theodore Gill.[19]\\r\\nLater the electric eel was considered sufficiently distinct to have its own family, Electrophoridae, but it has since been merged back into the family Gymnotidae, alongside Gymnotus.[7][20][21]","input":"How much voltage does an electric eel have?"},{"output":"Rocky V","context":"Sage Moonblood Stallone (May 5, 1976 ÿ July 13, 2012) was an American actor, film director, film producer, and film distributor.

That water is not sold for commercial purposes. The Edwards Aquifer, the aquifer that feeds a different spring fed pool in Austin called Barton Springs, is not the source of the water that fills Deep Eddy Pool. Barton Springs Pool has been closed a number of times since the 1980s due to fecal coliform bacteria entering the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone. Barton Creek drains directly into the Colorado River. Austin derives its drinking water from three water treatment plants that take water from the Colorado River. The Edwards Aquifer derives water from many sources, the vast majority off which are not related to springs, including run-off from the aforementioned Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone. This aquifer is considered a surface aquifer and is not \\"deep beneath the Earth,\\" as stated on the Deep Eddy Vodka website. At its deepest point, the Edwards Aquifer is only 700 feet deep. The Edwards Aquifer flows beneath 38 counties, comprising 8000 square miles, and is San Antonio's main source of drinking water; so this aquifer is in no way unique to Austin.

This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy.[1] Hemispherectomy is reserved for the most extreme cases of this one-third in which the individuals seizures are irresponsive to medications or other less invasive surgeries and significantly impair functioning or put the patient at risk of further complications. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85%-90% of patients. Additionally, it is also known to often markedly improve the cognitive functioning and development of the individual.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHemispherectomy was first performed on a dog in 1888 by Friedrich Goltz. The first such operation on humans was done by Walter Dandy in 1928[3] for glioblastoma multiforme. Hemispherectomy was revitalized in children in the 1980s by John M. Freeman and Ben Carson [4] at Johns Hopkins Hospital.[5]\\r\\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, hemispherectomy involved essentially removing an entire half of the brain. This procedure is known as anatomical hemispherectomy. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. A second type of hemispherectomy, known as functional hemispherectomy, has become more prevalent in recent years. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. If a functional hemispherectomy is chosen over an anatomical hemispherectomy, it is likely because it allows for less blood loss and greater chance of resilience for the patient.[6][7] Additionally, functional hemispherectomy is less likely to cause hydrocephalus, the excessive accumulation of (cerebrospinal) fluid in the brain, which leads to complications from harmful pressure on brain tissues.[8]\\r\\nWithin the last fifteen years, a few types of functional hemispherectomies have emerged. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherectomy. Peri-insular hemispherectomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. In this procedure, the surgeon aims to disconnect (rather than remove) the hemisphere, in order to minimize long term complications.[9] Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery.[10]\\r\\nBecause of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. Criteria include no successful control of seizures throughout a variety of drug trials, and a reasonable to high chance of procedural success.[11]\\r\\nOne such predictor of success is often the age of the patient. This procedure is almost exclusively performed in children because their brains generally display more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the tasks from the lost hemisphere. This likely occurs by strengthening neural connections which already exist on the unaffected side but which would have otherwise remained small in a normally functioning, uninjured brain.[12] In one study of children under 5 who had this surgery to treat catastrophic epilepsy, 73.7% were freed of all seizures.[13]\\r\\nSuccess of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades.[14] A case study published in 2015 of 2 adults aged 48 and 38 demonstrated the success of functional hemispherectomy in treating status epilepticus (SE), an epileptic condition in which seizures are prolonged or occur closely together.[15] In 2012, a case study following 30 individuals having undergone some form of hemispherectomy in adulthood found that 81% of individuals were seizure free post-procedure. Furthermore, almost all participating patients reported improved quality of life. The conclusion: (a)dult patients do not have to expect more problems with new deficits, appear to cope quite well, and mostly profit from surgery in several quality of life domains.[16]\\r\\nUltimately, the chances of benefit and improvement to the individual must outweigh the costs. For example, a neurosurgeon would not recommend hemispherectomy in a patient who still possessed significant functionality, despite frequent seizures. Such a patient would risk losing their remaining functionality. Likewise, hemispherectomy likely would be recommended to a patient with debilitating seizures. A patient with little or severely deteriorating functioning does not have as much to risk by having the procedure, thus the chance of benefit to them is greater.[17] Depending on the case, a recommendation for a hemispherectomy could be more risky for a child than for an adult. Thus, age is not always the deciding success factor for hemispherectomies.\\r\\nOverall, hemispherectomy is a successful procedure. A 1996 study of 52 individuals who underwent the surgery found that 96% of patients experienced reduced or completely ceased occurrence of seizures post-surgery.[18] Studies have found no significant long-term effects on memory, personality, or humor,[19] and minimal changes in cognitive function overall.[20] For example, one case followed a patient who had completed college, attended graduate school and scored above average on intelligence tests after undergoing this procedure at age 5.5. This patient eventually developed \\"superior language and intellectual abilities\\" despite the removal of the left hemisphere, which contains the classical language zones.[21]\\r\\nWhen resecting the left hemisphere, evidence indicates that some advanced language functions (e.g., higher order grammar) cannot be entirely assumed by the right side. The extent of advanced language loss is often dependent on the patient's age at the time of surgery.[22] One study following the cognitive development of two adolescent boys who had undergone hemispherectomy found that brain plasticity and development arise, in part, from the brains adaption of behavioral needs to fit available strengths and biasesThe boy adapts the task to fit his brain more than he adapts his brain to fit the task.[23] Neuroplasticity after hemispherectomy does not imply complete regain of previous functioning, but rather the ability to adapt to the current abilities of the brain in such a way that the individual may still function, however differently the new way of functioning is.\\r\\nAlong with neuroplasticity, people who undergo hemispherectomies remarkably recover due to resilience. Resilience is the ability, in this case, of the brain being able to recover from a tough situation and take back its shape. Neuroplasticity resilience explains why the hemisphere that is still intact is able to recover many of the functions that were once the removed hemisphere's job. Resilience here is an action in patients with hemispherectomies in which they recover and navigate back to health.[24]\\r\\nThere are cases where a person that received major trauma to one side of the brain, such as a gunshot wound, has required a hemispherectomy and survived. The most notable case is that of Ahad Israfil, who lost the right side of his cerebrum in 1987 in a gun-related work accident. He eventually regained most of his faculties, though he still required a wheelchair. It was noted that reconstructive surgery was difficult due to the gunshot shattering his skull, and he is living with a large indentation on that side of his head.","input":"How can someone live with half a brain?"},{"output":"Anthony Kiedis","context":"Red Hot Chili Peppers is an American funk rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1983.[1] The band was formed by vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Hillel Slovak, bassist Flea, and drummer Jack Irons after they met while attending Fairfax High School. Since its inception, Red Hot Chili Peppers has maintained a four-member lineup, with fourteen official members overall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1983, two weeks before signing with EMI, Slovak and Irons obtained a record deal with MCA Records with their other band, What Is This?, and left Red Hot Chili Peppers.[2] Rather than dissolving the band, Kiedis and Flea decided to recruit new members. Cliff Martinez was hired as the band's new drummer and Martinez's bandmate in The Weirdos, guitarist, Dix Denney was expected to replace Slovak.  After a few rehearsals, however, the band felt he didn't fit and auditions continued.  Their final candidates were guitarists Mark Nine and Jack Sherman, about whom the band knew nothing.  After practicing with Sherman, they felt that he was the best fit because he worked well with Flea and Martinez.[3] With Martinez and Sherman aboard, the band released their eponymous debut album on August 10, 1984. During the ensuing tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life.[4][5] Sherman was fired soon after, with Slovak returning to the Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?.[6] At one point, Chuck Biscuits filled in on drums during the 1985 tour. The band dismissed Cliff Martinez from the group in April 1986 due to personal differences and replaced him with founding member Jack Irons, who was out of work and finally separated from other commitments.[7] During this period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, which resulted in Kiedis being briefly fired that same year. At one performance, longtime friend and then Circle Jerks frontman, Keith Morris filled in for an absent Kiedis who was out scoring drugs while his band was playing a show.[8][9] On June 25, 1988, Slovak died of a heroin overdose shortly after the completion of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan tour. Kiedis would then retreat into hiding, further fueling his drug habit and even skipping Slovak's funeral. After a band meeting with manager Lindy Goetz, Irons subsequently left the group, saying that he did not want to be part of a band where his friends were dying.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAttempting to cope with the death of Slovak and the departure of Irons, Kiedis and Flea temporarily employed Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro and former P-Funk guitarist DeWayne McKnight.[10] McKnight's tenure was brief, lasting three shows in September 1988 before he was fired. He was quickly replaced by John Frusciante in October 1988 and writing for the next album quickly began. Peligro however was dealing with personal substance problems of his own and would last a few more months before he too was fired. Despite several open auditions, the band remained without a drummer. One of the final drummers to audition was Chad Smith, who Kiedis said was so proficient on the drums he \\"ate [them] for breakfast\\".[11] After another successful jam session, Kiedis, Frusciante and Flea admitted Smith into the Chili Peppers and was hired in November 1988.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1992 Japanese leg of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour, Frusciante, overwhelmed by the band's new-found success and his drug addiction, abruptly quit in May.[1] Circle Jerks bassist Zander Schloss was auditioned but after four days of rehearsing, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith decided that Schloss did not fit with their future plans.[13] The band originally had wanted Dave Navarro as their guitarist but Navarro's band, Jane's Addiction had just broken up and he wasn't ready to join another band. With a major summer tour planned including a headlining spot at Lollapalooza, guitarist Arik Marshall of L.A. band Marshall Law was hired as Frusciante's official replacement and would finish out the remainder of tour with the band. Coming off their most successful tour the band was excited to start recording their next album however during pre-production of their sixth studio album, tensions grew between the band and Marshall, and they dismissed him from the band in early 1993.[14] Shortly following Marshall's firing, the band held open auditions that proved to be a failure.[15] Kiedis attended a show by local L.A. band, Mother Tongue and quickly was drawn to the band's guitarist, Jesse Tobias. Tobias was recruited after a series of auditions; however, his tenure with the band was brief and after weeks of writing and rehearsals for the next album the band stated that \\"the chemistry wasn't right\\" and he was fired although the band already had his replacement ready. Chad was friends with and in contact with Navarro, who he said was now ready to join the band so on September 5, 1993 Navarro was officially hired as the band's seventh guitarist and work quickly began on the band's next record, One Hot Minute, which would be released in 1995 and was seen as a disappointment in sales compared to their previous album.[16][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's One Hot Minute tour proved to be successful however for the band it could easily be viewed as a disaster. Navarro never felt he fit properly in the band and the chemistry just wasn't there with him. Following attempts to write and rehearse for their seventh studio album, in April 1998, it was announced that Navarro had been fired from the band due to creative differences; Kiedis stated that the decision was \\"mutual\\".[18] With the band on the brink of a break-up, Kiedis informed Flea that he felt the only way the band could continue is if Frusicante would return. Flea surprised Kiedis by stating he had been in contact with Frusciante and had a feeling he might be open to rejoining. That same month after Navarro's departure, Flea visited Frusciante and invited him to rejoin the band. An emotional and now sober Frusciante readily accepted the invitation. With Frusciante back, the band went on to release three of their most successful albums; 1999's Californication, 2002's By the Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2007 following the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers went on a hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason.[20] The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 when they started to write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Frusciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. Speculation proved to be true with Frusciante already having quit the band for a second time on July 29, 2009 however it wasn't until December 2009 in a post on his official website that he made his departure from the band official to the public.[21] He stated that he left Red Hot Chili Peppers during the hiatus to focus on a solo career.[22][23] Klinghoffer, who acted as a sideman during 2007 dates on the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and on John Frusciante's solo projects, joined the band on October 12, 2009;[24] however, his membership was not announced until February 8, 2010.[25][26] With Klinghoffer, the band saw this as a new beginning and in August 2011 they released their tenth-studio album, I'm with You. During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 14, 2012, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted by Chris Rock into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer (who became the youngest inductee ever), Frusciante, Slovak, Irons and Martinez were the members inducted. Slovak was inducted on behalf of his brother, James while Frusciante, who was invited, declined the band's offer and didn't show up although was heavily praised during the induction speech by his former bandmates. Despite their contributions to the band's studio albums, Jack Sherman and Dave Navarro were neither inducted nor invited to the ceremony because the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee decided that only original members, current members or those who played on more than one album were able to be inducted.\\r\\nBoth Martinez and Irons joined the band (marking the first time either drummer had performed with the Chili Peppers since their departures from the band in the 1980s) onstage for a performance of \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Higher Ground\\", which ended up in an all-star jam involving some of the night's inductees and other guest musicians. The band released their eleventh studio album, The Getaway in June 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2011[update], the lineup of Red Hot Chili Peppers includes one vocalist, one bassist, one drummer, and one guitarist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former members of Red Hot Chili Peppers consist of seven guitarists and three drummers.\\r\\n\\r\\nRed Hot Chili Peppers has employed numerous touring and studio musicians throughout its career. A touring or studio musician is an unofficial member who will perform live or contribute in the studio with the band although is not considered an official member. Vicki Calhoun, Keith \\"Tree\\" Barry, and Philip Fisher did contribute to Mother's Milk (1989), where Calhoun performed backing vocals on \\"Knock Me Down\\", \\"Higher Ground\\", \\"Good Time Boys\\", and \\"Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky\\", Barry played tenor sax on \\"Subway to Venus\\", and Fisher provided drums on \\"Taste the Pain\\". Josh Klinghoffer was featured as a backing musician on the final half of the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and eventually become an official member replacing guitarist John Frusciante in 2009. The band's longtime roadie/drum technician, Chris Warren, also became a member of touring lineup in 2007 providing keyboards and drum synthesizers. The band's I'm with You Tour and its following 2013/2014 tour featured percussionist, Mauro Refosco. Refosco also provided percussion for most of the tracks on the band's I'm with You album and related releases. For the band's 2016 The Getaway World Tour, Nate Walcott joined the touring lineup providing piano and keyboards while the band's assistant tour manager Samuel Ba?uelos III provides additional bass when the band performs \\"Go Robot\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band has also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly fill in for a show or two. Morris, who was fronting the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't know any of the lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled his way through the show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.","input":"Who are the members of red hot chili peppers?"},{"output":"the Industrial Revolution","context":"The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today. Compared to wood fuels, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel, coal is now used mostly in industry, especially in smelting and alloy production as well as electricity generation. Large-scale coal mining developed during the Industrial Revolution, and coal provided the main source of primary energy for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation.[1] Coal is also mined today on a large scale by open pit methods wherever the coal strata strike the surface or are relatively shallow. Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward, with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress.[1] However, oil and gas were increasingly used as alternatives from the 1860s onward.\\r\\nBy the late 20th century, coal was, for the most part, replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil, natural gas or electricity produced from oil, gas, nuclear power or renewable energy sources. By 2010, coal produced over a fourth of the world's energy, and by 2050 it is expected to produce about a third.[2]\\r\\nSince 1890, coal mining has also been a political and social issue. Coal miners' labour and trade unions became powerful in many countries in the 20th century, and often, the miners were leaders of the Left or Socialist movements (as in Britain, Germany, Poland, Japan, Chile, Canada and the U.S.)[3][4] Since 1970, environmental issues have been increasingly important, including the health of miners, destruction of the landscape from strip mines and mountaintop removal, air pollution, and coal combustion's contribution to global warming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly coal extraction was small-scale, the coal lying either on the surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included drift mining and bell pits. As well as drift mines, small scale shaft mining was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called room and pillar in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with pillars left to support the roofs. Both of these techniques however left considerable amount of usable coal behind.\\r\\nArcheological evidence in China indicates surface mining of coal and household usage after approximately 3490 BC. [5]\\r\\nThe earliest reference to the use of coal in metalworking is found in the geological treatise On stones (Lap. 16) by the Greek scientist Theophrastus (c. 371ÿ287 BC):\\r\\nAmong the materials that are dug because they are useful, those known as coals are made of earth, and, once set on fire, they burn like charcoal. They are found in Liguria... and in Elis as one approaches Olympia by the mountain road; and they are used by those who work in metals.[6]\\r\\nThe earliest known use of coal in the Americas was by the Aztecs who used coal for fuel and jet (a type of lignite) for ornaments.[1]\\r\\nIn Roman Britain, the Romans were exploiting all major coalfields (save those of North and South Staffordshire) by the late 2nd century AD.[7] While much of its use remained local, a lively trade developed along the North Sea coast supplying coal to Yorkshire and London.[7] This also extended to the continental Rhineland, where bituminous coal was already used for the smelting of iron ore.[7] It was used in hypocausts to heat public baths, the baths in military forts, and the villas of wealthy individuals. Excavation has revealed coal stores at many forts along Hadrian's Wall as well as the remains of a smelting industry at forts such as Longovicium nearby.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the Romans left Britain, in AD 410, there are few records of coal being used in the country until the end of the 12th century. One that does occur is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 852 when a rent including 12 loads of coal is mentioned.[8] In 1183 a smith was given land for his work, and was required to \\"raise his own coal\\"[9]:171ÿ2 Shortly after the signing of the Magna Carta, in 1215, coal began to be traded in areas of Scotland and the north-east England, where the carboniferous strata were exposed on the sea shore, and thus became known as \\"sea coal\\". This commodity, however, was not suitable for use in the type of domestic hearths then in use, and was mainly used by artisans for lime burning, metal working and smelting. As early as 1228, sea coal from the north-east was being taken to London.[10]:5 During the 13th century, the trading of coal increased across Britain and by the end of the century most of the coalfields in England, Scotland and Wales were being worked on a small scale.[10]:8 As the use of coal amongst the artisans became more widespread, it became clear that coal smoke was detrimental to health and the increasing pollution in London led to much unrest and agitation. As a result of this, a Royal proclamation was issued in 1306 prohibiting artificers of London from using sea coal in their furnaces and commanding them to return to the traditional fuels of wood and charcoal.[10]:10 During the first half of the 14th century coal began to be used for domestic heating in coal producing areas of Britain, as improvements were made in the design of domestic hearths.[10]:13 Edward III was the first king to take an interest in the coal trade of the north east, issuing a number of writs to regulate the trade and allowing the export of coal to Calais.[10]:15 The demand for coal steadily increased in Britain during the 15th century, but it was still mainly being used in the mining districts, in coastal towns or being exported to continental Europe.[10]:19 However, by the middle of the 16th century supplies of wood were beginning to fail in Britain and the use of coal as a domestic fuel rapidly expanded.[10]:22\\r\\nIn 1575, Sir George Bruce of Carnock of Culross, Scotland, opened the first coal mine to extract coal from a \\"moat pit\\" under the sea on the Firth of Forth. He constructed an artificial loading island into which he sank a 40?ft shaft that connected to another two shafts for drainage and improved ventilation. The technology was far in advance of any coal mining method in the late medieval period and was considered one of the industrial wonders of the age.[11]\\r\\nDuring the 17th century a number of advances in mining techniques were made, such the use of test boring to find suitable deposits and chain pumps, driven by water wheels, to drain the collieries.[10]:57ÿ9\\r\\nNorth American coal deposits were first discovered by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake in central New Brunswick, Canada in the 1600s. Coal seams were exposed where rivers flowed into the lake and was dug by hand off the surface and from tunnels dug into the seam. About 1631 the French made their fur trading post at the mouth of the Saint John River their main post in Acadia and started construction of a new fort. The main residence at the fort was designed with two 11 foot wide fireplaces which were stocked with wood and coal from up river. As early as 1643, the French were sending coal and other supplies to the British colony at Boston. [12][13][14][15]\\r\\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the 18th century, and later spread to continental Europe, North America, and Japan, was based on the availability of coal to power steam engines. International trade expanded exponentially when coal-fed steam engines were built for the railways and steamships during the Victorian era. Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than wood fuel in most steam engines. As central and Northern England contains an abundance of coal, many mines were situated in these areas as well as the South Wales coalfield and Scotland. The small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, with extraction moving away from surface extraction to deep shaft mining as the Industrial Revolution progressed.[16]\\r\\nAs steamships traveled overseas from the industrialized countries of Europe their need for coal served as trigger for coal mining to start at various locations across the globe. An example of this is the coal mining in Zona Centro Sur, Chile, that began as a response to the arrival of steamships to Talcahuano.[17]\\r\\nAlthough some deep mining took place as early as the 1500s (in North East England, and along the Firth of Forth coast)[19][20] deep shaft mining in the UK began to develop extensively in the late 18th century, with rapid expansion throughout the 19th century and early 20th century when the industry peaked. The location of the coalfields helped to make the prosperity of Lancashire, of Yorkshire, and of South Wales. The Yorkshire pits which supplied Sheffield were only about 300 feet deep. Northumberland and Durham were the leading coal producers and they were the sites of the first deep pits. In much of Britain coal was worked from drift mines, or scraped off when it outcropped on the surface. Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment.\\r\\nScottish miners had been bonded to their \\"maisters\\" by a 1606 Act \\"Anent Coalyers and Salters\\". A Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775, recognised this to be \\"a state of slavery and bondage\\" and formally abolished it; this was made effective by a further law in 1799.[21][22]\\r\\nBefore 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep Tyneside pits (300 to 1,000?ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned at the bottom of the \\"upcast\\" shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the Davy lamp and Geordie lamp, where any firedamp (or methane) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by restricting the ingress of air with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near Lige.\\r\\nCoal was so abundant in Britain that the supply could be stepped up to meet the rapidly rising demand. In 1700 the annual output of coal was just under 3 million tons. Between 1770 and 1780 the annual output of coal was some 6? million long tons (or about the output of a week and a half in the 20th century). After 1790 output soared, reaching 16 million long tons by 1815 at the height of the Napoleonic War. By 1830 this had risen to over 30 million tons[23] The miners, less affected by imported labour or machines than were the cotton mill workers, had begun to form trade unions and fight their grim battle for wages against the coal owners and royalty-lessees.[24]\\r\\nUse of women and children (at a fraction of the cost of men) was common until abolished in an Act of August 1842.[25]\\r\\nIn South Wales, the miners showed a high degree of solidarity. They lived in isolated villages where the miners comprised the great majority of workers. There was a high degree of equality in life style; combined with an evangelical religious style based on Methodism this led to an ideology of egalitarianism. They forged a \\"community of solidarity\\" - under the leadership of the Miners Federation. The union supported first the Liberal Party, then after 1918 Labour, with some Communist Party activism at the fringes.[26]\\r\\nThe need to maintain coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both world wars.[27] As well as energy supply, coal became a very political issue, due to conditions under which colliers worked and the way they were treated by colliery owners. Much of the 'old Left' of British politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas, with the main labour union being the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised National Union of Mineworkers).\\r\\nAlthough other factors were involved, one cause of the UK General Strike of 1926 was concerns colliers had over very dangerous working conditions, reduced pay and longer shifts.\\r\\nTechnological development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries helped both to improve the safety of colliers and the productive capacity of collieries they worked. In the late 20th century, improved integration of coal extraction with bulk industries such as electrical generation helped coal maintain its position despite the emergence of alternative energies supplies such as oil, natural gas and, from the late 1950s, nuclear power used for electricity. More recently coal has faced competition from renewable energy sources and bio-fuels.\\r\\nMost of the coal mines in Britain were purchased by the government in 1947 and put under the control of the National Coal Board, with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of Alf Robens, pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an unofficial strike began in 1969 after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an official strike in 1972 won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a Three Day Week in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new Selby Coalfield.\\r\\nBy the early 1980s, many pits were almost 100 years' old and were considered uneconomic[28] to work at then current wage rates compared to cheap North Sea oil and gas, and in comparison to subsidy levels in Europe. The Miners' Strike of 1984 failed to stop the Conservative government's plans under Margaret Thatcher to shrink the industry, and a break-away Union of Democratic Mineworkers was founded by miners, mostly in the Midlands, who felt that the NUM had broken its own democratic rules in calling the strike. The National Coal Board (by then British Coal), was privatised by selling off a large number of pits to private concerns through the mid-1990s. Because of exhausted seams, high prices and cheap imports, the mining industry disappeared almost completely, despite the militant protests of some miners.[27][29]\\r\\nIn January 2008, the South Wales Valleys last deep pit mine, Tower Colliery in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taff closed with the loss of 120 jobs. The coal was exhausted.[30] Until 2015 coal was still mined at Hatfield, Kellingley and Thoresby Collieries, and is extracted at several very large opencast pits in South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere. Kellingley Colliery was the last deep coal mine in operation in the UK and its last coaling shift was on 18 December 2015 when coaling operations ceased with the loss of 450 jobs bringing deep coal mining in the UK to an end in its entirety, a skeleton team of men will remain to service the colliery until it is finally dismantled.\\r\\nCoal mining was never a major industry in Ireland, apart from a spell in the mid-19th century when east Tyrone collieries were at their peak. Deerpark Mines was the largest opencast site. In 1919 it got rail connections and reached peak production in the 1950s.[31]\\r\\nAnthracite (or \\"hard\\" coal), clean and smokeless, became the preferred fuel in cities, replacing wood by about 1850. Bituminous (or \\"soft coal\\") mining came later. In the mid-century Pittsburgh was the principal market. After 1850 soft coal, which is cheaper but dirtier, came into demand for railway locomotives and stationary steam engines, and was used to make coke for steel after 1870.[32]\\r\\nTotal coal output soared until 1918; before 1890, it doubled every ten years, going from 8.4 million short tons in 1850 to 40 million in 1870, 270 million in 1900, and peaking at 680 million short tons in 1918. New soft coal fields opened in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, as well as West Virginia, Kentucky and Alabama. The Great Depression of the 1930s lowered the demand to 360 million short tons in 1932.[33]\\r\\nUnder John L. Lewis, the United Mine Workers (UMW) became the dominant force in the coal fields in the 1930s and 1940s, producing high wages and benefits.[34] In 1914 at the peak there were 180,000 anthracite miners; by 1970 only 6,000 remained. At the same time steam engines were phased out in railways and factories, and bituminous coal was used primarily for the generation of electricity. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields.\\r\\nIn the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.[35]\\r\\nIn 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state. It uses strip mining exclusively. Wyoming's coal reserves total about 69.3 billion tons, or 14.2% of the U.S. coal reserve.[36]\\r\\nIn 2008, competition was intense in the US coal mining industry with some U.S. mines approaching the end of their useful life (mine closure).[citation needed] Other coal-producing countries also stepped up production to win a share of traditional US export markets. Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2008 created severe competition.\\r\\nIn 1984 Australia surpassed the US as the world's largest coal exporter. One-third of Australia's coal exports were shipped from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, where coal mining and transport had begun nearly two centuries earlier. Coal River was the first name given by British settlers to the Hunter River after coal was found there in 1795. In 1804 the Sydney-based administration established a permanent convict settlement near the mouth of the Hunter River to mine and load the coal, predetermining the town's future as a coal port by naming it Newcastle. Today, Newcastle, NSW, is the largest coal port in the world. Now the state of Queensland is Australia's top coal producer, with its Bowen Basin the main source of black coal, and plans by miners such as Gina Rinehart to open up the Galilee and Surat Basins to coal mining.\\r\\nCanadian coal mining started in New Brunswick and also occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. The United States has been a major supplier for the industrial regions of Ontario. By 2000 about 19% of Canada's energy was supplied by coal, much of it imported from the U.S while Eastern Canadian ports import considerable coal from Venezuela.\\r\\nThe first coal mining in North America began in New Brunswick, Canada in the early 1600s. Coal was found by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake where rivers and erosion had exposed the coal. Small amounts of coal were dug from surface deposits and tunnels dug into the coal seams, and this coal supplied Fort Saint Marie, built by the French about 1632 at the mouth of the Saint John River. The French sold coal to the British colony at Boston as early as 1639. Due to this earliest export of coal in North America, Grand Lake has been recognized as a Canadian Historic Site . Coal mining expanded after the British took control of the area in the mid 1700s and encouraged permanent settlements in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario by British Loyalists. Beginning in 1765, over 11,000 Loyalists settled in N.B., most along the lower 100 miles of the Saint John River and around Grand Lake. Approximately 200,000 tons of coal were dug at Grand Lake between 1639 and 1887 using surface collection, vertical shafts and the room and pillar system. By 1920, the use of draglines and other modern equipment made strip mining possible and the privately owned Grand Lake area mines produced over 200,000 tons per year. Most of this coal was used by the railroad and large businesses. By 1936, a coal burning electric power generating plant at Newcastle Creek was operating with two 33,000 volt lines going to Fredericton and one 66,000 volt line going to Marysville. By 1950, coal production at Grand Lake often reached 1 million tons per year. In 1969, all the privately owned Grand Lake area coal companies and approximately 1,000 employees were consolidated into one provincial government controlled company named N.B. Coal Ltd.. In 2009, the increasing availability of oil and environmental concerns with coal use caused the closing of the Grand Lake coal mines and New Brunswick's coal mining industry.\\r\\nThe first coal mining in Nova Scotia began in the 18th century with small hand-dug mines close to the sea at Joggins, Nova Scotia and in the Sydney area of Cape Breton Island. Large scale coal mining began in the late 1830s when the General Mining Association (GMA), a group of English mining investors, obtained a coal mining monopoly in Nova Scotia. They imported the latest in mining technology including steam water pumps and railways to develop large mines in the Stellarton area of Pictou County, Nova Scotia, including the Foord Pit which by 1866 was the deepest coal mine in the world.[37] Coal mining also developed in Springhill and Joggins in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. After the GMA monopoly expired, the largest and longest lasting mines developed at Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia was the major supplier of Canadian coal until 1945.[38] At its peak in 1949 25,000 miners dug 17 million metric tons of coal from Nova Scotian mines. The miners, who lived in company towns, became politically active in left-wing politics during labour struggles for safety and fair wages. Westray Mine near Stellarton closed in 1992 after an explosion killed 26 miners. All the subsurface mines were closed by 2001, although some open pit coal mining continues near Stellarton. The Nova Scotia Museum of Industry at Stellarton explores the history of mining in the province from its location on the site of the Foord Pit.\\r\\nCoal was easy to find in what is now Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. The Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has turned this coalfield into a museum. This museum interprets how the Blackfoot and Cree knew about the \\"black rock that burned.\\" After many explorers reported coal in the area, a handful of ranchers and homesteaders dug out the coal for their homes. Sam Drumheller started the coal rush in this area when he bought the land from a local rancher, which he then sold to the Canadian National Railway. Sam Drumheller also registered a coal mine. However, before his mine opened Jesse Gouge and Garnet Coyle beat him to it by opening the Newcastle Mine. Once the railway was built thousands of people came to mine this area.\\r\\nBy the end of 1912, there were nine working coal mines, in Newcastle, Drumheller, Midland, Rosedale, and Wayne. In years to follow more mines sprang up: Nacmine, Cambria, Willow Creek, Lehigh, and East Coulee. The timing of the Drumheller mine industry was \\"lucky\\" according to the Atlas National Historical Site, in that the United Mine Workers union had recently won the right for better working conditions. As a result of union action, child labour laws were passed to prevent boys under 14 years old working underground.[39]\\r\\nMiners' camps in this area were called \\"hell's holes\\" because miners lived in tents and shacks. These camps were filled with drinking, gambling and watching fistfights as forms of recreation. With time, living conditions improved: little houses took the place of the tents, and more women joined the men and started families. With new activities such as hockey, baseball and theatre the camps were no longer \\"hell's holes\\" but became \\"the wonder town of the west.\\"\\r\\nBetween 1911 and 1979, 139 mines were registered in the Drumheller Valley, of which only 34 were productive for many years. The beginning of the end for the Drumheller mining industry was the discovery of oil at Leduc No. 1 in 1947, after which natural gas became the predominant fuel for heating homes in western Canada. As the demand for coal dropped, mines closed and communities suffered. Some communities, Willow Creek for example, completely vanished while others went from boomtowns to ghost towns.\\r\\nAtlas #4 Mine shipped its last load of coal in 1979, after which the Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has preserved the last of the Drumheller mines. Also nearby, East Coulee School Museum interprets the life of families in mine towns for its visitors.[40]\\r\\nPierre-Francois Tubeuf laid the foundations of the modern industry in France, starting in 1770 in Languedoc.[41] Labor unions emerged with an emphasis on the safety issue in the late 19th century. In 1885, there were 175 injuries per thousand workers per year. Deaths were low in most years 2 per 1000 workers), but major disaster was always a threat. 1099 men died in the Courrires mine disaster of 1906.[42] The campaign for mine safety enabled miners to break from their peasant psychology and create solidarity that came from sharing dangerous work, and to develop a working-class consciousness. Unions gain strength by setting up a system of worker elected mine-safety delegates. The national government encouraged the mine safety movement as a means of limiting strife in the sometimes turbulent coal fields.[43] Nevertheless, strikes remained very common, and coal miners took the lead in political organization.[44] Germany seized control of some mining districts in the First World War, leaving them devastated. Polish, Spanish and other immigrants were brought in to provide a stable labor force at the end of the war.[45]\\r\\nThe first important mines appeared in the 1750s, in the valleys of the rivers Ruhr, Inde and Wurm where coal seams outcropped and horizontal adit mining was possible. In 1782 the Krupp family began operations near Essen. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the Ruhr Area, which then became part of Prussia took advantage of the tariff zone (Zollverein) to open new mines and associated iron smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on ironworks, using local coal. The iron and steel works typically bought mines, and erected coking ovens to supply their own requirements in coke and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms (\\"Huettenzechen\\") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called \\"Konzern.\\"\\r\\nThe average output of a mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, the average mine's output had risen to 280,000 and the employment to about 1,400.[46] Total Ruhr coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.[47] At the end of 2010 five coal mines were producing in Germany.\\r\\nThe miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (with Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.[26]\\r\\nBy 1830 when iron and later steel became important in Wallonia the Belgian coal industry had long been established, and used steam engines for pumping. The Belgian coalfield lay near the navigable River Meuse, so coal was shipped downstream to the ports and cities of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. The opening of the Saint-Quentin Canal in 1810 allowed coal to go by barge to Paris. The Belgian coalfield outcrops over most of its area, and the highly folded nature of the coal seams, part of the geological Rhenohercynian Zone, meant that surface occurrences of the coal were very abundant. Deep mines were not required at first, so a large number of small operations sprang up. There was a complex legal system for concessions, and often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper, thanks to the good pumping system. In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was 220 meters (720?ft). By 1856, the average depth in the Borinage was 361 meters (1,184?ft), and in 1866, 437 meters (1,434?ft) and some pits had reached down 700 to 900 meters (2,300 to 3,000?ft); one was 1,065 meters (3,494?ft) deep, probably the deepest coal mine in Europe at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high coal miner fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted, and the steel industry was importing some coal from the Ruhr.[48] Andr Dumont's discovery in 1900 of coal in the Campine basin, in the Belgian Province Limburg, prompted entrepreneurs from Lige to open coal mines, mainly producing coal for the steel industry. An announced reorganisation of the Belgian coal mines in 1965 resulted in strikes and a revolt which led to the death of two coal miners in 1966 at the Zwartberg mine. Coal was mined in the Lige basin until 1980, in the Southern Wallonian basin until 1984, and in the Campine basin until 1992.\\r\\nThe first permanent coal mine in Poland was established in Szczakowa near Jaworzno in 1767. In 19th century development of iron, copper and lead mining and processing in southern Poland (notably in the Old-Polish Industrial Region and later in the region of Silesia) led to a quick development of coal mining. Among the most prominent deposits are those located in what are now the Upper Silesian Industrial Region and Rybnik Coal Area (formerly part of Prussia) and the Zag??bie D?browskie on the Russian side of the border.\\r\\nIn modern times coal is still considered a strategic resource for Poland's economy, as it covers roughly 65% of energetic needs. Before and after World War II Poland has been one of the major coal producers worldwide, usually listed among the five largest. However, after 1989 the coal production is in decline, with the overall production for 1994 reaching 132 million metric tons, 112 million metric tons in 1999 and 104 million metric tons in 2002.\\r\\nFrom the 1860s large deposits in the Don Basin (\\"Donbas\\") in southern Russia supplied 87% of Russia's coal. It was used by railways and the iron and steel industry. After 1900 smaller deposits near Dombrovo, Zabaikal and Cheremkhovo in Siberia were opened. Small older mines south of Moscow also operated. Coal production was controlled by inefficient Russo-British syndicates, and there were shortages of workers, so the companies set up welfare systems for them. Their smallish output and the weak Russian railway system centered on the Ekaterininskaia (Krivoi Rog) Railway held back the growth of Russian heavy industry.[49][50][51]\\r\\nIn the Second World War the loss of 60% of the mining areas to German invaders forced the rapid expansion of mines in the Urals, as well as greater use of mines in the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia. In 1939 the Urals produced only half the fuel needed by local industry. During the war the mines were expanded and over 700 factories were evacuated from the west, greatly increasing the demand for Ural coal. Prisoners from the Gulag were sent to the mines; up to a third of the workers were women. The miners were given much higher rations of food. Output doubled and the share of the region in the total national coal production rose from 8% to 22%.[52]\\r\\nIn 1989-91 militant coal miners in Russia and Ukraine were the mainstay of the revolutionary forced which finally overthrew the Communist system in 1991.[53]\\r\\nToday the Donets Basin is the major coal-mining district in eastern Ukraine and adjacent portions of Russia. Production during 2009 was 68.7 million tons in the Ukrainian and 4.9million tons in the Russian part of the basin, but coal gas is a major hazard.[54]\\r\\nThe industry in China goes back many centuries.[55] In recent decades has become the main energy source of what (from 2010) is the world's second largest economy.[56] Thus China is by far the largest producer of coal in the world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8 percent of all coal produced in the world during that year.[57] For comparison, the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year.[58] Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines.[59]\\r\\nCommercial exploitation began in 1774, John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company setting up operations in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of river Damodar. Due to a lack of demand growth was sluggish until 1853, with the introduction of steam locomotives to the fast-expanding rail system.\\r\\nAs late as 1895, India imported large quantities of coal from Britain, but as domestic production increased and was found to be suitable for locomotives and ships, demand for coal imports declined dramatically. India's export of coal increased, especially to Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay states.[60]\\r\\nBy 1900 production had risen to an annual average of 1 million tonne (mt) and India was producing 6.12 mts. per year by 1900[citation needed] and 18 mts per year by 1920.[citation needed] Temporary wartime demand (1914-1918) was followed by a slump in the 1930s. The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.\\r\\nAfter India became independent, the new government stressed the rapid growth of heavy industry. The National Coal Development Corporation was founded in 1956 (as a Government of India) undertaking. The founding of this body was major step in the development of an indigenous Indian coal sector. Especially important was the development of the vast Dhanbad coal-mining complex with such major operations as Tata Steel, BCCL, ECL and IISCO (Indian Iron And Steel Company), as well as the Indian School of Mines to train engineers, geologists and managers.[61]\\r\\nIn the 21st century, Indonesia has expanded its coal mining and by 2011 ranked #5 globally in production.[62] By 2011 Kazakhstan ranks in the top ten in terms of coal production and reserves. Lignite (\\"brown coal\\") remains important with Germany, China and Russia the largest producers.[63]\\r\\nMining has always been especially dangerous, because of explosions, roof cave-ins, and the difficulty of underground rescue. The worst single disaster in British coal mining history was at Senghenydd in the South Wales coalfield. On the morning of 14 October 1913 an explosion and subsequent fire killed 436 men and boys. Only 72 bodies were recovered. It followed a series of many extensive Mining accidents in the late 19th century, such as The Oaks explosion of 1866 and the Hartley Colliery Disaster of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by firedamp ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single shaft was blocked by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine. Deaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as afterdamp.[64]\\r\\nThe Courrires mine disaster, Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906. The Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26, 1942, killed 1,549 miners.[65]\\r\\nAs well as disasters directly affecting mines, there have been disasters attributable to the impact of mining on the surrounding landscapes and communities. The Aberfan disaster in 1966 buried a school in South Wales when a huge slag heap collapsed, killing 116 children and 28 adults.","input":"When did coal become a major energy source?"},{"output":"on the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley, and an adjacent national preserve located in the Sangre de Cristo Range, in south-central Colorado, United States","context":"Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is an American national park that conserves an area of large sand dunes up to 750 feet (229?m) tall[4] on the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley, and an adjacent national preserve located in the Sangre de Cristo Range, in south-central Colorado, United States.[5] The park was originally designated Great Sand Dunes National Monument on March 17, 1932 by President Herbert Hoover. The original boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi; 143.8?km2).[6] A boundary change and redesignation as a national park and preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 and then established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi; 434.4?km2) while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi; 168.7?km2) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi; 603.1?km2).[1] The recreational visitor total was 486,935 in 2017, about 25% more than the 388,308 visitors of 2016.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America.[7] The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8] Sediments from the surrounding mountains filled the valley over geologic time periods. After lakes within the valley receded, exposed sand was blown by the predominant southwest winds toward the Sangre de Cristos, eventually forming the dunefield over an estimated tens of thousands of years.[9] The four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha.[8] Ecosystems within the mountain watershed include alpine tundra, subalpine forests, montane woodlands, and riparian zones.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence of human habitation in the San Luis Valley dates back about 11,000 years. The first historic peoples to inhabit the area were the Southern Ute Tribe, while Apaches and Navajo also have cultural connections in the dunes area. In the late 17th century, Don Diego de Vargasa Spanish governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mxicobecame the first European on record to enter the San Luis Valley. Juan Bautista de Anza, Zebulon Pike, John C. Frmont, and John Gunnison all travelled through and explored parts of the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. The explorers were soon followed by settlers who ranched, farmed and mined in the valley starting in the late 19th century. The park was first established as a national monument in 1932 to protect it from gold mining and the potential of a concrete manufacturing business.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors must walk across the wide and shallow Medano Creek to reach the dunes in spring and summer months. The creek typically has a peak flow from late May to early June in most years. From July through April, the creek is usually no more than a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes with the warning that the sand surface temperature may reach 150?F (66?C) in summer.[13] Sandboarding and sandsledding are popular activities, both done on specially designed equipment which can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa.[14] Visitors with street-legal four-wheel drive vehicles may continue past the end of the park's main road to Medano Pass on 22 miles (35?km) of unpaved road, crossing the stream bed of Medano Creek nine times and traversing 4 miles (6.4?km) of deep sand.[15] Hunting is permitted in the preserve during the months of autumn, while hunting is prohibited within national park boundaries at all times.[16] The preserve encompasses nearly all of the mountainous areas north and east of the dunefield, up to the ridgeline of the Sangre de Cristos.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area dates back about 11,000 years. Some of the first people to enter the San Luis Valley and the Great Sand Dunes area were nomadic hunter-gatherers whose connection to the area centered around the herds of mammoths and prehistoric bison. They were Stone Age people who hunted with large stone spear or dart points now identified as Clovis and Folsom points. These people only stayed when hunting and plant gathering was good, and avoided the region during times of drought and scarcity.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern American Indian tribes were familiar with the area when Spaniards first arrived in the 17th century. The traditional Ute phrase for the Great Sand Dunes is Saa waap maa nache, \\"sand that moves.\\" Jicarilla Apaches settled in northern New Mexico and called the dunes Sei-anyedi, \\"it goes up and down.\\" Blanca Peak, just southeast of the dunes, is one of the four sacred mountains of the Navajo, who call it Sisnaajini. These various tribes collected the inner layers of bark from ponderosa pine trees for use as food and medicine. The people from the Tewa/Tiwa-speaking pueblos along the Rio Grande remember a traditional site of great importance located in the valley near the dunes: the lake through which their people emerged into the present world. They call the lake Sip'ophe, meaning \\"Sandy Place Lake\\", which is thought to be the springs and/or lakes immediately west of the dunefield.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1694, Don Diego de Vargas became the first European known to have entered the San Luis Valley, although herders and hunters from the Spanish colonies in present-day northern New Mexico probably entered the valley as early as 1598. De Vargas and his men hunted a herd of 500 bison in the southern part of the valley before returning to Santa Fe. In 1776, Juan Bautista de Anza and an entourage of men and livestock probably passed near the dunes as they returned from a punitive raid against a group of Comanches. At this time, the valley was a travel route between the High Plains and Santa Fe for Comanches, Utes, and Spanish soldiers. The dunes were likely a visible landmark for travelers along the trail.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first known writings about Great Sand Dunes appear in Zebulon Pikes journals of 1807. As Lewis and Clarks expedition was returning east, U.S. Army Lt. Pike was commissioned to explore as far west as the Arkansas and Red Rivers. By the end of November 1806, Pike and his men had reached the site of todays Pueblo, Colorado. Still pushing southwest, and confused about the location of the Arkansas River, Pike crossed the Sangre de Cristos just above the Great Sand Dunes.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter marching some miles, we discovered ... at the foot of the White Mountains [todays Sangre de Cristos] which we were then descending, sandy hillsWhen we encamped, I ascended one of the largest hills of sand, and with my glass could discover a large river [the Rio Grande] The sand-hills extended up and down the foot of the White Mountains about 15 miles, and appeared to be about 5 miles in width. Their appearance was exactly that of the sea in a storm, except as to color, not the least sign of vegetation existing thereon.\\r\\nIn 1848, John C. Frmont was hired to find a railroad route from St. Louis to California. He crossed the Sangre de Cristos into the San Luis Valley in winter, courting disaster but proving that a winter crossing of this range was possible. He was followed in 1853 by Captain John Gunnison of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. Gunnisons party crossed the dunefield on horseback.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years that followed, the Rockies were gradually explored, treaties were signed and broken with resident tribes, and people with widely differing goals entered the San Luis Valley from the United States and Mexico. In 1852, Fort Massachusetts was built and then relocated to Fort Garland, about 20 miles southeast of the Great Sand Dunes, to safeguard travel for settlers following the explorers into the valley. Although many settlers arrived via the trails from Santa Fe or La Veta Pass, several routes over the Sangre de Cristos into the valley were well-known to American Indians and increasingly used by settlers in the late 1800s. Medano Pass, also known as Sand Hill Pass, and Mosca Pass, also called Robidouxs Pass, offered more direct routes from the growing front range cities and dropped into the valley just east of the Great Sand Dunes. Trails were improved into wagon routes and eventually into rough roads. The Mosca Pass Toll Road was developed in the 1870s, and stages and the mail route used it regularly through about 1911 when the western portion was damaged in a flash flood. Partially rebuilt at times in the 1930s through the 1950s, the road was repeatedly closed due to flood damage and is now a hiking trail.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Herard familyafter whom Mount Herard is named[17]established a ranch and homestead along Medano Creek in 1875, using the old Medano Pass Road to travel to and from their home. The modern unpaved road follows the old route and is open only to four-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicles as it passes through deep sand, rises to Medano Pass, and continues east into the Wet Mountain Valley. The Herards grazed and bred cattle in the mountain meadows, raised horses, and established a trout hatchery in the stream. Other families homesteaded near the dunes as well, including the Teofilo Trujillo family whose sheep and cattle ranch in the valley later became part of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, owned by the Nature Conservancy since 1999. The Trujillo's extant homestead and the ruins of a destroyed one were declared a National Historic Landmark in 2004.[18] Frank and Virginia Wellington built a cabin and hand-dug the irrigation ditch that parallels Wellington Ditch Trail located south of the park campground.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGold and silver rushes occurred around the Rockies after 1853, bringing miners by the thousands into the state and stimulating mining businesses that are still in operation. Numerous small strikes occurred in the mountains around the San Luis Valley. People had frequently speculated that gold might be present in the Great Sand Dunes, and local newspapers ran articles in the 1920s estimating its worth at anywhere from 17 cents/ton to $3/ton. Active placer mining operations sprang up along Medano Creek, and in 1932 the Volcanic Mining Company established a gold mill designed to recover gold from the sand. Although minute quantities of gold were recovered, the technique was too labor-intensive, the stream too seasonal, and the pay-out too small to support any business for long.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that the dunes could be destroyed by gold mining or concrete manufacturing alarmed residents of Alamosa and Monte Vista. By the 1920s, the dunes had become a source of pride for local people, and a potential source of tourist dollars for local businesses. Members of the P.E.O. Sisterhood sponsored a bill to Congress asking for national monument status for Great Sand Dunes. Widely supported by local people, the bill was signed into law in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments expansion into a national park and preserve in 2000-2004.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] rising to a maximum height of 750 feet (229?m)[4] from the floor of the San Luis Valley on the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCreation of the San Luis Valley began when the Sangre de Cristo Range was uplifted in the rotation of a large tectonic plate. The San Juan Mountains to the west of the valley were created through extended and dramatic volcanic activity. The San Luis Valley encompasses the area between the two mountain ranges and is roughly the size of the state of Connecticut. Sediments from both mountain ranges filled the deep chasm of the valley, along with huge amounts of water from melting glaciers and rain. The presence of larger rocks along Medano Creek at the base of the dunes, elsewhere on the valley floor, and in buried deposits indicates that some of the sediment has been washed down in torrential flash floods.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, geologists discovered lakebed deposits on hills in the southern part of the valley, confirming theories of a huge lake that once covered much of the San Luis Valley floor. The body of water was named Lake Alamosa after the largest town in the valley. Lake Alamosa suddenly receded after its extreme water pressure broke through volcanic deposits in the southern end of the valley. The water then drained through the Rio Grande, likely forming the steep Rio Grande Gorge near Taos, New Mexico. Smaller lakes still covered the valley floor, including two broad lakes in the northeastern side of the valley. Large amounts of sediment from the volcanic San Juan Mountains continued to wash down into these lakes, along with some sand from the Sangre de Cristo Range. Dramatic natural climate change later significantly reduced these lakes, leaving behind the sand sheet. Remnants of these lakes still exist in the form of sabkha wetlands.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSand that was left behind after the lakes receded blew with the predominant southwest winds toward a low curve in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The wind funnels toward three mountain passesMosca, Medano, and Music Passesand the sand accumulates in this natural pocket. The winds blow from the valley floor toward the mountains, but during storms the winds blow back toward the valley. These opposing wind directions cause the dunes to grow vertically. Two mountain streamsMedano and Sand Creeksalso capture sand from the mountain side of the dunefield and carry it around the dunes and back to the valley floor. The creeks then disappear into the sand sheet, and the sand blows back into the dunefield. Barchan and transverse dunes form near these creeks. The combination of opposing winds, a huge supply of sand from the valley floor, and the sand recycling action of the creeks, are all part of the reason that these are the tallest dunes in North America.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSufficient vegetation has grown on the valley floor that there is little sand blowing into the main dunefield from the valley; however, small parabolic dunes continue to originate in the sand sheet and migrate across grasslands, joining the main dunefield. Some of these migrating dunes become covered by grasses and shrubs and stop migrating. The dunes system is fairly stable as the opposing wind directions balance each other out over time. Also, the main dunefield is moist beneath a thin layer of dry surface sand. While the top few inches of sand are blown around during windstorms, the moist sand remains largely in place.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists estimate that Lake Alamosa disappeared about 440,000 years ago, but the dunes themselves apparently originate from sand deposits from later, smaller lakes. A relatively new dating process, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is still in development. This method takes core samples of sand from deep within a dune, and attempts to measure how long quartz grains have been buried in the dark. If the deepest sand deposits can be accurately dated, the age of the dunes could be determined. Samples of sand from deep in the dunes have returned OSL dates varying between a few hundred years to tens of thousands of years old. The oldest dated deposits found so far would have accumulated in the late Pleistocene epoch, during the middle years of the current ice age's third stage.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dunes contain dark areas which are deposits of magnetite, a mineral that has eroded out of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Magnetite is both attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a magnet itself; it is the most magnetic mineral in nature.[19] Magnetite is an oxide of iron which is heavier than the surrounding particles of sand. When overlying sand is removed by wind, magnetite deposits stay in place and are visible as dark patches in the dunefield.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is located in Saguache and Alamosa Counties, Colorado at approximately 37.75 north latitude and 105.5 west longitude. The national park is located in the San Luis Valley while the national preserve is located to the east in an adjacent section of the Sangre de Cristo Range of the Rocky Mountains.[5] Elevations range from 7,515?ft (2,291?m) in the valley west of the dunes, to 13,604?ft (4,146?m) at the summit of Tijeras Peak in the northern part of the preserve.[21][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) while the surrounding relatively flat sand sheet which feeds the large dunes is actually the largest component of the entire dunes system, containing about 90% of all the sand in the park.[8] The forested and often snowcapped mountains exceeding 13,000?ft (4,000?m) to the east are the most prominent feature, towering over the high dunes. Other features include snow-fed creeks originating high in the mountains, and several alpine lakes. Two spring-fed creeks in the sand sheet along with a few small lakes in the valley's sabkha section southwest of the dunes create a wetland that nurtures wildlife.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main dunefield measures roughly 4?mi (6.4?km) east-to-west and 6?mi (9.7?km) north-to-south, with an adjacent 6?sq?mi (16?km2) area to the northwest called the Star Dune Complex, for a total of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2). The park and preserve together are approximately 15?mi (24?km) east-to-west at the widest point, and approximately 15?mi (24?km) north-to-south, also at the widest point.[5] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi; 434.4?km2), while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi; 168.7?km2) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi; 603.1?km2).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rio Grande National Forest is located to the north and southeast while the remaining forested slopes directly to the east of the dunes were redesignated the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. The San Isabel National Forest is located to the east of the preserve just beyond the ridge of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Private property abuts most of the southern boundary of the park. The San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area lies adjacent to the southwestern corner of the park, while the Rio Grande flows through the valley farther to the southwest. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge lies adjacent to the west, and the slopes of the San Juan Mountains begin at the western edge of the valley. Private property of the Baca Grande subdivision of Crestone lies adjacent to the northwest.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nearest city is Alamosa which is about 30?mi (48?km) away by road to the southwest.[22][23] The nearest towns are Crestone to the north, Mosca and Hooper to the west, Blanca and Fort Garland to the south, and Gardner to the east. Colorado Springs and Denver are located a few hours away by car to the northeast.[23] The major roads through the San Luis Valley are U.S. Route 160 on an eastÿwest alignment passing south of the park, and U.S. Route 285 on a northÿsouth alignment passing west of the park and generally parallel to Colorado State Highway 17, which is the closer of the two northÿsouth roadways.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Sand Dunes are located in the high elevation desert of the San Luis Valley, just west of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The summer high temperatures are atypical for a desert area as the average high temperature is only slightly above 80?F (27?C) in the warmest month of July; however, the large spread between high and low temperatures is typical of a high desert climate. Low temperatures during winter nights can be extremely cold, with average low temperatures well below 32?F (0?C) and record low temperatures below 0?F (?18?C) from November through April.[24] Precipitation is very low on the dunes, averaging just 11.13 inches (283?mm) of rainfall per year.[25] The high evaporation rates on the dunes qualify the area as a desert, even though precipitation exceeds 10 inches (250?mm).\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring can sometimes bring high winds, mainly in the afternoon. Spring conditions vary greatly, from mild and sunny to cold and snowy. March is the snowiest month of the year, though some days are above 50?F (10?C). In late spring, when Medano Creek usually has its peak flow, snow or high winds are still possible. In summer, daytime high temperatures average 75ÿ80?F (24ÿ27?C); however, sand surface temperatures can soar to 150?F (66?C) on sunny afternoons. Summer nights are coolthe park is located 8,200?ft (2,500?m) above sea levelwith nighttime temperatures often dropping below 50?F (10?C). Afternoon thundershowers are common in July and August with cool winds, heavy rain and lightning. Fall is generally mild, with Indian summer days when temperatures reach 60?F (16?C) and higher, but chilly nights below freezing. Occasional fall storms bring icy rain or snow. Cold temperatures well below freezing are typical in winter, although the sunshine is generally abundant and the dry air doesn't feel as cold as more humid areas. The average winter high temperatures are just above freezing even in January, which is the coldest month of the year.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha. The mountain watershed receives heavy snow and rain which feeds creeks that flow down from alpine tundra and lakes, through subalpine and montane woodlands, and finally around the main dunefield. Sand that has blown from the valley floor is captured in streams and carried back toward the valley. As creeks disappear into the valley floor, the sand is picked up and carried to the dunefield once again. The recycling action of water and wind, along with a 7% moisture content below the dry surface holding the sand together, contributes to the great height of the dunes.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dunefield is composed of reversing dunes, transverse dunesalso called crescentic or barchan dunesand star dunes. The sand sheet is the largest component of the system, comprising sandy grasslands that extend around three sides of the dunefield. Almost 90% of the sand deposit is found in the sand sheet, while the remainder is found in the dunefield. Small parabolic dunes form in the sand sheet and then migrate into the main dunefield. Nabkha dunes form around vegetation. The sabkha forms where sand is seasonally saturated by rising ground water. When the water evaporates away in late summer, minerals similar to baking soda cement sand grains together into a hard, white crust. Areas of sabkha can be found throughout western portions of the sand sheet, wherever the water table meets the surface. Some wetlands in the sabkha are deeper with plentiful plants and animals, while others are shallow and salty.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands. Trees include aspen, Douglas fir, pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, three-leaf sumac, bristlecone pine, red osier dogwood, and narrow-leaf cottonwood.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the flowering plants are alpine phlox, dwarf clover, alpine forget-me-not, fairy primrose, alpine aven, Indian paintbrush, lousewort, blue-purple penstemon, aspen daisy, western paintbrush, elephantella, snow buttercups, scurfpea, Indian ricegrass, blowout grass, prairie sunflower, Rocky Mountain beeplant, rubber rabbitbrush, speargrass, small-flowered sand verbena, narrowleaf yucca, prickly pear cactus, Rocky Mountain iris, and white water buttercup.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nInland saltgrass is the primary type of grass around sabkha wetlands in the park.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nMammals includefrom alpine tundra to low elevation grasslandsthe pika, yellow-bellied marmot, bighorn sheep, black bear, snowshoe hare, Abert's squirrel, cougar, mule deer, water shrew, beaver, kangaroo rat, badger, pronghorn, and elk. Over 1500 bison are currently ranched within park boundaries on private land owned by The Nature Conservancy which is only open to the public through tours.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 200 species of birds are found throughout the park. From higher to lower elevations and dependent on season, some of the bird species include the brown-capped rosy finch, white-tailed ptarmigan, red-breasted nuthatch, peregrine falcon, mountain bluebird, northern pygmy owl, dusky grouse, hummingbird (four species), western tanager, burrowing owl, bald eagle, golden eagle, sandhill crane, American avocet, and great blue heron.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious reptiles live in the park, such as the short-horned lizard, fence lizard, many-lined skink, bullsnake, and garter snake.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nFish living in the park's streams include the Rio Grande cutthroat trout, Rio Grande sucker (Catostomus plebeius), and fathead minnow.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmphibians include the tiger salamander, chorus frog, northern leopard frog, spadefoot toad, Great Plains toad, and Woodhouse's toad.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park harbors several endemic insects including the Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, a circus beetle (Eleodes hirtipennis), Werner's (Amblyderus werneri) and Triplehorn's (Amblyderus triplehorni) ant-like flower beetle, as well as undescribed species of clown beetle, noctuid moth, and robber fly. More than a thousand different kinds of arthropods have been found at the Great Sand Dunes.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlpine tundra is the highest elevation ecosystem at Great Sand Dunes where the conditions are too harsh for trees to survive, but wildflowers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, ptarmigans, and bighorn sheep thrive. The tundra begins about 11,700?ft (3,600?m) and continues upward to the highest peaks in the park. At subalpine elevations near the tree line grow krummholz (meaning \\"crooked wood\\")trees which are stunted and twisted due to high winds, snow, ice, short growing seasons, and shallow, poorly developed soils. The transition zone between subalpine forest and alpine tundra is an important refuge during storms for some mammals and birds who primarily live on tundra. Bristlecone and limber pines grow at an extremely slow rate, with small statures that belie their true ages as some are more than a thousand years old.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubalpine forests and meadows capture heavy snow in winter and soaking rains in summer. The highest diversity of Rocky Mountain species of plants and animals are found in this ecosystem. Subalpine forest extends from 9,500?ft (2,900?m) to tree line at 11,700?ft (3,600?m). Montane forests and woodlands are found along the drier foothills at approximately 8,000?ft (2,400?m) to 9,500?ft (2,900?m). Pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine woodlands are found on open, drier slopes, while cottonwood and aspen trees are in drainages. Cougars hunt mule deer here at night. Owls, dusky grouse, turkeys, and bullsnakes all find habitat in these drier, open woodlands.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe riparian zone follows creeks through the subalpine and montane ecosystems at Great Sand Dunes. Cottonwood and aspen trees, red osier dogwood, and alder grow well in this wet environment, in turn providing shade and habitat for black bears, water shrews, and western tanagers. Rio Grande cutthroat trout are found in Medano Creek.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the top few inches of the dunefield are often dry, the dunes are moist year-round due to ongoing precipitation. Moisture content of 7% beneath the surface sand allows species such as Ord's kangaroo rat, Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, scurfpea, and blowout grass to survive here. Many animals visit the dunes from other habitats, including elk, pronghorn, bison, coyotes, bobcats, and raptors.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sand sheet includes extensive grasslands and shrublands that surround the dunefield on three sides, from 7,500?ft (2,300?m) to 8,200?ft (2,500?m). The sand sheet varies from wet meadows to cool-grass prairie to desert shrubland, depending on proximity to groundwater and soil type. Elk and pronghorn are common, while burrowing owls nest in the ground and other raptors float through the skies searching for mice, kangaroo rats, and short-horned lizards.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sabkha is a wetland region where groundwater rises and falls seasonally, leaving white alkali deposits on the surface. Inland saltgrass is common in this area. Toads can reproduce in sabkha wetlands when they are seasonally filled with sufficient fresh water. Shore birds such as the American avocet hunt tadpoles and insects in the shallow water. Wetlands speckle the San Luis Valley and are important habitat for sandhill cranes, shore birds, amphibians, dragonflies, and freshwater shrimp. Grassland species such as elk also use these waters for drinking. The sabkha and wetlands are at approximately 7,500?ft (2,300?m) in elevation.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park preserves the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] as well as alpine lakes and tundra, mountain peaks over 13,000 feet (3,962 m) in elevation, mixed conifer forests, grasslands, and wetlands.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedano Creek, which borders the east side of the dunes, never finds a permanent and stable streambed as fresh sand falls in the creek. Small underwater sand ridges that act like dams form and break down, creating surges of water which resemble waves. The surges occur at an average interval of about 20 seconds. In a high-water year, the surges can be as high as 20?in (51?cm). The \\"surge flow\\" mainly occurs during the peak flow period from late May to early June in most years.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Spring Creek is a unique spring-fed creek formed by an unconfined aquifer which creates wetlands that support rare species and plant communities in a generally arid area. The creek was designated a National Natural Landmark in 2012.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccessing the dunes requires walking across the wide and shallow Medano Creek. The creek typically flows past the main dunes parking area from late April through late June, with peak flow occurring from late May to early June in most years. In other months, the creek is usually only a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes, with the warning that the sand can get very hot in the summer, up to 150?F (66?C).[13] Sand wheelchairs are available at the visitor center.[37] Sandboards and sand sleds can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa which is the closest city.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMosca Pass Trail is a 7?mi (11?km) roundtrip hike that follows a small creek through aspen and evergreen forests to Mosca Passelevation 9,737?ft (2,968?m)[5]in the Sangre de Cristo Range. American Indians and early settlers used this route for travel between the San Luis Valley and the Wet Mountain Valley to the east. Several trails located in the northeastern section of the park lead to alpine lakes high in the mountains. A trail to Medano Lake and the summit of Mount Herard is located off Medano Pass Road. A trail along Sand Creek leads to the Sand Creek Lakes and Music Passelevation 11,380?ft (3,470?m)[5]with a view of the Upper Sand Creek basin. Spur trails along Sand Creek lead to the four alpine lakes which feed the creek, and to several 13,000?ft (4,000?m) peaks above the basin. The Sand Ramp Trail traverses between the dunefield and the mountains, connecting the park's campground to Medano Pass Road (follow the road up to Medano Lake and Pass), as well as the base of the Sand Creek Trail.[13][5] Most of the park's grasslands, shrublands and wetlands have no established trails but are generally open to hiking. The Nature Conservancy's Medano Ranch property may only be visited on a guided tour. A fence surrounds the property to contain the Conservancy's bison herd and demarcate the boundaries.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedano Pass Road is a 22?mi (35?km) four-wheel drive (4WD) road that begins where the main park road ends.[39] The unpaved road crosses Medano Creek nine times and traverses 4?mi (6.4?km) of deep sand. Only street-licensed 4WD motor vehicles or motorcycles, and bicycles are permitted.[15] Fat tire bikes are the only type of bicycle recommended by the park service due to the deep sandy stretches.[40] The road winds around the eastern side of the dunefield, up through a forested mountain canyon inside the National Preserve, and then over Medano Passelevation 9,982?ft (3,043?m)[5]at the 11.2?mi (18.0?km) mark. The road then continues down into the Wet Mountain Valley and connects with Colorado State Highway 69. Travellers are advised that hunting is permitted in the National Preserve during the months of autumn.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the national park and the entire national preserve are open to horseback riding and pack animals. Prohibited zones include all developed areassuch as the Pinyon Flats campground, picnic areas, and the visitor centerall paved roadways and many of the hiking trails, along with the dunes area from the parking lot to as far as the High Dune, which is for pedestrian use only. All national park horse camping areas are in the wilderness in designated backcountry campsites or other wilderness areas at least 0.25?mi (0.4?km) from roads or trails. Camping is permitted anywhere in the national preserve and at designated sites along the Medano Pass Road, as long as minimum impact guidelines are followed. Permitted pack animals in the national park and the preserve include horses, mules, burros, donkeys, alpacas, and llamas. Overnight guests at the Zapata Ranch may take guided trips into the park; Zapata Partners is the only NPS-licensed provider of horseback riding in the Great Sand Dunes.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike all other national parks in the contiguous United States, Great Sand Dunes National Park is located directly adjacent to a national preserve. The preserve is also managed by the National Park Service and seasonal hunting is permitted there.[16] Sport hunting has regulations which include not pursuing a wounded animal if it leaves the preserve and enters the national park. Mountain lion hunting with dogs is also allowed in the preserve, but unless the dogs have spotted the lion and are pursuing it, they are required to be leashed.[43] Other game species include turkey, bear, bighorn sheep, elk and mule deer.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dunes and surrounding area were designated a national monument in 1932 after a billsponsored by the P.E.O. Sisterhood and widely supported by local residentswas signed into law by President Herbert Hoover.[11] The original monument boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi; 143.8?km2).[6] Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in 2000-2004.[11] The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the Great Sand Dunes as a protected landscape (management category V) in 2000, including the national park, the preserve, and the adjacent Baca National Wildlife Refuge.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976, the U.S. Congress designated the Great Sand Dunes Wildernessa wilderness area encompassing 32,643 acres (51?sq?mi; 132?km2) within the monument. This wilderness is the only one in the U.S. that protects a saltbush-greasewood ecosystem and includes the entire dunefield as well as much of the area west of the dunes.[46][47] Congress also designated the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness in 1993, which contains a total of 219,776 acres (343.4?sq?mi; 889.4?km2) of mountainous terrain.[48] Most of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service while the National Park Service manages the area that has since been designated a national preserve.[49] Mechanized transport and motorized equipment or vehicles are not permitted in wilderness areas, while ATVs are not permitted anywhere in the national park and preserve.[48] The restrictions of a wilderness designation protect native wildlife such as the endemic Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle from potential extinction caused by human activities.[50] Both of the wilderness area designations exclude the existing road corridors that pass through them, specifically the paved park road and the unpaved Medano Pass Road.[47]  The IUCN has included the same 51 square miles (132?km2) of dunes and surrounding sand sheet on their global list of wilderness areas (management category Ib) since 1976.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, the Nature Conservancy purchased surrounding state-owned land.[52] The land is within the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, located to the west and south.[53] Some of the ranch land is located within the current national park boundary in its southwestern corner,[5] and includes a fenced area that contains a bison herd within 44,000 acres (68.8?sq?mi; 178.1?km2)[52]an area that can only be visited on a guided tour.[54][55] The objective of the Nature Conservancy, as well as the federal and state governments, is to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem, in a manner similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the Yukon in Canada.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eventual redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 when President Bill Clinton signed the Congressionally-approved Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Act. The act directed the Secretary of the Interior to \\"establish the Great Sand Dunes National Park when sufficient land having sufficient diversity of resources has been acquired to warrant its designation.\\"[56] The new designation as a national park and preserve would not be made official until 2004 after sufficient land had been acquired.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, the Nature Conservancy purchased the Baca Ranchan area of 97,000 acres (151.6?sq?mi; 392.5?km2)for $31.28 million. Financing was provided by the Department of the Interior, the Colorado State Land Board and private donors. The Baca Ranch had property located in the valley and the adjacent mountains, ranging in elevation from 7,500?ft (2,286?m) west of the dunes to the 14,165?ft (4,317?m) summit of Kit Carson Peak. The purchase approximately tripled the size of the monument. The ranch was split into three sections: the Sangre de Cristos section east of Crestone became part of the Rio Grande National Forest; the section west of the dunes was designated the Baca National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service; the section east of the dunes was transferred first to the Rio Grande National Forest and later redesignated a national preserve in 2004 managed by the National Park Service. The national preserve remains open to regulated seasonal hunting, as it was when designated national forest land, but is protected from logging and mining activities which are generally permitted in national forests.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boundaries of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve were established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the federal government began negotiations toward purchasing 12,518 acres (19.6?sq?mi; 50.7?km2) of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch from the Nature Conservancy. The plan is to complete the park, making it fully accessible to the public, by acquiring the final piece of privately-held land located within the current park boundaries. The land includes the area presently occupied by the bison herd, as well as adjacent meadows and wetland areas. The purchase is expected to be completed by 2018.[58]","input":"Where is great sand dunes national park located?"},{"output":"October 1996","context":"Card playing\\r\\nArithmetic\\r\\nBasic reading ability\\r\\nThe Pokmon Trading Card Game (̸ƹة, Pokemon Kdo Gmu, \\"Pokmon Card Game\\"), abbreviated to PTCG or Pokmon TCG, is a collectible card game, based on the Pokmon video game series, first published in October 1996 by Media Factory in Japan. In the US, it was initially published by Wizards of the Coast; Nintendo eventually took over publishing the card game alongside the video games in June 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers assume the role of a Pokmon trainer and use their Pokmon to battle their opponents'. Players play Pokmon to the field and attack their opponent's Pokmon. A Pokmon that has sustained enough damage is knocked out, and the player who knocked it out draws a Prize card. There are usually six Prize cards, and the primary win condition is to draw all of them. Other ways to win are by knocking out all the Pokmon the opponent has on the field such that the opponent has none left, or if at the beginning of their opponent's turn there are no cards left to draw in the opponent's deck.[1]\\r\\nPlayers begin by shuffling their decks and drawing seven cards, then playing one Basic Pokmon onto the field. This Pokmon is known as the Active Pokmon, and is usually the one that attacks and receives damage. If a player does not have any Basic Pokmon, they must shuffle and draw a new hand, and the opponent may draw one additional card. Once both players have at least one Basic Pokmon, they can play up to five more Basic Pokmon onto their \\"Bench\\" (representing the maximum-carry limit of six from the video games). Players then take the top six cards of their deck and place them to the side as Prize Cards. Next, one player selects heads or tails, and the other flips a coin; the winner of the coin flip will decide who goes first or second. The player going first cannot attack on their first turn. (Dice may be used in place of coins, with even numbers representing heads and odd numbers representing tails).\\r\\nPlay alternates between players who may take several actions during their turn, including playing new Basic Pokmon, evolving their Pokmon, playing Trainer cards and Energy cards, and using Pokmon Abilities. A player may also retreat their Active Pokmon, switching the Active Pokmon with one on the Bench. At the end of their turn, a player may use one of their Active Pokmon's attacks, provided the prerequisite amount and types of Energy are attached to that Pokmon. Effects from that attack are then activated and damage may be placed on the Defending Pokmon (some attacks simply have effects but do not do damage). This damage may be modified depending on whether the defender has a Weakness or Resists the attacker's Pokmon type. If the final damage exceeds the defending Pokmon's HP, it is Knocked Out, and the active player takes a Prize Card and ends their turn.[2]\\r\\nBasic Pokmon are the foundation of all decks. Without them a player cannot play the game, since both players begin the game by placing a Basic Pokmon in the Active position on the field. Each Pokmon card depicts a Pokmon from the video games. Each player may have up to six Pokmon on the playing field at a time: one \\"Active\\" Pokmon and up to five on the bench. Each Pokmon card has a name, a type, and an amount of Health Points (HP). All Pokmon feature attacks; these typically deal damage to the opponent's active Pokmon, or occasionally, their benched Pokmon; however, an attack may also perform different functions, such as drawing cards, inflicting Special Conditions, or altering the opponent's board state. The vast majority of these attacks require Energy, which comes in the form of Energy cards. Abilities (known as Pok-Powers and Pok-Bodies until 2011) are not attacks but simply effects that either are activated under certain conditions, or remain in effect as long as the Pokmon with the Ability remains in play.\\r\\nThe other type of Pokmon card is an Evolved Pokmon. Basic Pokmon are Pokmon that have not evolved, and can be played directly onto the Bench. In contrast, an Evolved Pokmon cannot normally be placed directly onto the field; they must be played on top of the corresponding lower-stage Pokmon. Stage 1 Pokmon evolve from Basic Pokmon, and Stage 2 Pokmon evolve from Stage 1 Pokmon. As a Pokmon evolves, it gains HP and its attacks change, typically becoming more powerful. Pokmon ex or EX cards were first introduced in the TCG set EX Ruby and Sapphire, and typically have higher Hit Points than other Pokmon, yet award an extra prize card to the opponent when defeated. Baby Pokmon cards, introduced in Neo Genesis, are a special kind of Basic Pokmon that have low HP but attack with strange (sometimes very powerful) effects. Mega Pokmon, introduced in XY, evolve from Pokmon-EX, but are a special stage; as such, effects on Stage 1 Pokmon do not apply to Mega Pokmon. Break Pokmon were also introduced later on in the XY series. Variations of Basic, Evolved, and Baby Pokmon cards have appeared in many sets, usually indicated with a word before or after the Pokmon's name. Secret Rare Pokmon cards are some of the rarest cards. They are usually represented by a shiny holo foil and a gold outline. These cards include Shiny Pokmon, Trainers, alternate-art Pokmon, and some rarer Mega evolution cards. New with the Pokmon Sun & Moon expansion are Pokmon-GX cards. These cards have a specific move set at the bottom of their card that can only be used once per game.[3] Only one GX move can be played per game, so if there are three different Pokmon-GX cards in your deck only one of the three GX moves can be used. Also with the new Pokmon Sun & Moon sun and moon expansion are Alolan Pokmon, these Pokmon are monsters that have an alternate form from their original look that is specific to Alola and the Sun & Moon series. [4]\\r\\nEnergy cards are attached to a Pokmon to power that Pokmon's attacks. Typically, only one Energy card may be played per turn. There are two main categories of Energy cards: Basic Energy and Special Energy. The nine different Basic Energy types (which correspond to Pokmon card types) are Grass, Fire, Water, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Darkness, Metal, and Fairy. Two additional types, Dragon and Colorless, do not have their own Energy cards and instead use other types of Energy. Basic Energy cards are used only to fulfill costs for attacking and retreating, while Special Energy cards have additional benefits. Most attacks require a certain type and amount of Energy. If an attack requires a certain type and amount of Energy, then that type and amount of Energy must be attached to the Pokmon. If the attack has a Colorless Energy requirement, that requirement can be met by any Energy card.[2]\\r\\nTrainer cards perform various functions to affect the game: healing Pokmon, discarding energy from the opposing Pokmon, or retrieving cards from the discard pile are some key examples. Before the Diamond & Pearl expansion, all cards that were not Pokmon or Energy were considered Trainer cards. Trainers have since been subdivided into categories: Item cards directly affect the battling Pokmon, Stadium cards affect the entire field, and Supporters are like more powerful Items, only one of which can be played per turn.[2]\\r\\nA simplified type system was adopted from the video games for use in the trading card game. Instead of 18 types of Pokmon, only eleven exist in the TCG. Seven were introduced in the Base Set (the first ever set of Pokmon cards); Darkness and Metal types appeared when Pokmon Gold and Silver introduced the Dark and Steel types in the video games; the Dragon type was introduced in the Japanese Dragon Selection set; and finally, the Fairy type was introduced in the Japanese XY set to correspond to its introduction in the video games.\\r\\nMost Pokmon have only one type, three exceptions are EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua which introduced Dual-type Pokmon that have two different types, XY: Steam Siege, and the Heartgold/ Soulsilver era sets. Dual-types were utilized in Pokmon LEGEND cards, to emphasize the multiple Pokmon the mechanic has in the Heartgold and Soulsilver sets. In August 2016, the Steam Siege expansion from the XY Series reintroduced dual-type Pokmon, this time with regular Pokmon being multiple types as well as EX Pokmon.\\r\\nA new set addition in November of 2017, with the announcement of SM4: Crimson Invasion in North America, 75 different sets have been released in English[5] and 69 in Japanese.[6]\\r\\nA rarely played format is Unlimited, in which all cards released in English are legal (except oversized cards, such as promotional boxes like Mega Blaziken Ex Premium Collection Box).[citation needed]\\r\\nEvery few sets, new Mechanics or types of cards are introduced to the game. Several of these include: Dark Pokmon (Team Rocket); Owners' Pokmon and Stadium cards (Gym Heroes); Darkness-type and Metal-type Pokmon, the second generation, and Pokmon Tools (Neo Genesis); Shining Pokmon (Neo Revelation); Light Pokmon (Neo Destiny); Supporter cards and Technical Machines (Expedition); Crystal-type Pokmon (Aquapolis); Pokmon-ex (EX Ruby & Sapphire); Dual-type Pokmon (EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua); Pokmon Star (EX Team Rocket Returns); Delta Species Pokmon and Holon's Pokmon (EX Delta Species); Pokmon LV.X, the separation of Trainer, Supporter and Stadium cards, and the addition of Metal and Darkness as Basic Energy types (Diamond and Pearl); Pokmon With Items (Mysterious Treasures);Pokmon-GX, with a move that is playable only once a game (Sun & Moon);\\r\\nTrainer cards of which two can be played at once (Stormfront); owner-specific Pokmon SP (Platinum), Pokmon LEGEND (HeartGold and SoulSilver Collection), Pokmon PRIME which replace Pokmon Lv. X (\\"HeartGold and SoulSilver Collection\\"), Full Art cards (Black and White), Dragon-type Pokmon, BREAK evolution cards which replace Pokmon PRIME (XY BREAKthrough), and the newly release GX cards from Sun and Moon. These changes, along with yearly format rotations, make for a constantly evolving game.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition to the collectible aspect of the card game, The Pokmon Company International (formerly known as Pokmon USA) has also created Play! Pokmon, formerly known as Pokmon Organized Play (POP), which is in charge of the organization of an official League program, where players can battle others in local environments and earn player points, two-card booster packets from a promotional set, badges, stickers and other materials. These are run by League leaders and owners. POP also runs a professor program, in which individuals age 18 or over may become a professor, who can sanction and run tournaments and leagues. A League Leader may assist in organizing the league, while a League Owner is the one officially in charge of the league, reporting to the Organized Play program any results and/or problems every seven weeks. The leagues run in yearly cycles, based on a certain aspect of one of the Pokmon Video Game or Trading Card Game: the current cycle is based upon the Newest set, The current season is Evolutions season.\\r\\nPrerelease tournaments are organized just before each set is released. Usually, they are run on the two weekends before a set is released in stores to the public. At Prerelease Tournaments players are given three booster packs from the judge and must construct a 40 card deck, with only 4 prize cards, using only the cards pulled from the packs and the judges provide the energy, but not special energy cards. Many fans have come up with alternative methods of playing the Trading Card Game. Certain websites such as PokCap are dedicated to providing players with a new twist to their card game with new game rules they can follow. New methods may be based more on the video game adaptations of Pokmon or the Pokmon television show.\\r\\nPlayers in a tournament are split into three age categories: Junior (born in 2003 or later), Senior (born in 2000-2002), and Master (born in 1999 or earlier). Notable references include: Austin Brewen who won the first junior tournament, Brenden Zhang who won the first Senior Tournament, and Arturo Heras who won the first Master Tournament. These tournaments play a number of rounds, where players will play a standard game against each other and wins and losses will be recorded. In most tournaments, there are a number of Swiss-style rounds where players are paired up against others of similar win/loss ratios, usually from their own age group (this does not always occur in smaller events, though). Afterwards, there will either be a cut of the top record-holders (approximately the top 1/8 of participants) where players will play best two out of three matches, and the loser gets eliminated (standard tournament bracket style), with an eventual winner.\\r\\nPOP runs a season for these tournaments, which allows players to earn larger prizes and play in a more competitive environment in comparison to League. These range from City and State Championships, all the way up to the Pokmon World Championships, the single invite-only event of the year. Players can earn invites to the World Championships by winning or ranking high at National Championships, doing well at tournaments to get Championship Points, or by qualifying in the Last Chance Qualifier. The World Championships is a three-day tournament, with one eventual winner in each age group; the winner of the Masters Division age group is generally noticed as the best player in the world for that season. Some of these methods are only used in the United States, as PUI and POP are based in the United States, but they are represented by local distributors who provide the Organized Play program to their own country.\\r\\n2017 Worlds - Anaheim California [7]\\r\\n2018 Worlds - Nashville Tennessee[8]\\r\\nOn August 26ÿ27, 2000, forty-two Pokmon trainers from around the world met at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu for the Tropical Mega Battle, an international communication event for the Pokmon Trading Card Game. The Tropical Mega Battle brought together children aged 14 and under from the United States, Japan, France, Italy, Canada, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for two days in Honolulu, Hawaii. Children participating in the Tropical Mega Battle received invitations through Qualifier tournaments, DCI rankings, and other events in their respective countries.\\r\\nThe Super Trainer Showdowns were large Pokmon TCG tournaments held in the United States by Wizards of the Coast between 2000 and 2001. The tournaments were open to the public. Each tournament consisted of three age groups: 10 and under, 11 to 14 years old, and 15 years old and over. Each Super Trainer Showdown was preceded by a series of Qualifier Tournaments held in cities around the United States and abroad in which players in the 11-to-14 and 10-and-under age groups could win trips for themselves and a parent or guardian to the Super Trainer Showdown event. To date, there have been four Super Trainer Showdowns. The first Super Trainer Showdown was held in Long Beach, California inside of the cruise liner, the Queen Mary on July 22, 2000. The format was unlimited, meaning that all Pokmon cards released in the United States were legal for deck construction. The second Super Trainer Showdown was held at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, New Jersey on November 18, 2000. There were over 700 players in all three age divisions competing for the title. The tournament was eight rounds of Swiss style pairings followed by a cut to a top-eight single-elimination playoff. All games were best-of-one. The third Super Trainer Showdown was held again in the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, New Jersey. It was held on June 23ÿ24, 2001 and more than 1,600 players attended the event. The format for this event was titled Modified and allowed players to construct 60-card decks using a maximum of four of any card other than basic energy from specific sets. The fourth and final Super Trainer Showdown was held at the San Antonio Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas on December 1ÿ2, 2001[9]. The format was again \\"Modified\\", however the newest set Neo Discovery was also legal for the tournament.\\r\\nAlthough TPCI tries to keep Organized Play as equal as possible all over the Earth, there are some notable differences in how POP is run outside of the United States. The Pokmon Card Laboratory (PCL), located in Japan, is the designer of new cards and the ultimate authority on any matter relating to the Pokmon Trading Card Game. It can declare rulings on any in-game circumstance, issue errata, change card text after publishing, and change the basic game rules, although the latter three rarely occur. PCL runs Organized Play in Japan. The Pokmon Trading Card Game in most European countries is currently handled by The Pokmon Company International. Certain countries have no direct official presence; in these regions, distributors of the game run tournaments. European countries are able to qualify for positions at the Pokmon Trading Card Game World Championships each year, through National Championships and European Rankings.\\r\\nThere are a few video games based on the card game. Pokmon TCG Online (PTCGO) is the official digital version of the card game available for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Android and iPad.[10] It was originally released in April 2011 as Pokmon Trainer Challenge. The game initially offered three starting decks, and featured more content after release. After April 6, 2011, players could buy cards from the Black and White series, which have a code to be digitally represented.[11] Players can also create a custom avatar.[12] There were booster pack codes which allow booster packs up to Black and White-Boundaries Crossed, to be purchased from the online shop. However, as of Black and White- Plasma Storm, the code card within booster packs directly redeem as online booster packs of their respective set. GamesRadar praised the game, stating \\"Everything looks to be faithfully recreated, including the card mat, prize card layout, and even coins.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe eponymously titled Pokmon Trading Card Game, known as Pokmon Card GB in Japan, was developed for the Game Boy Color, releasing in Japan in December 1998 and later in North America and Europe in 2000. The game is based on the rules of the card game and features 226 cards from the game, as well as infrared linking for multiplayer and trading. The game was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014. A sequel, Pokmon Card GB2: Great Rocket-Dan Sanj! was released exclusively in Japan in March 2001.","input":"When were the pokmon playing cards first released by the pokmon company?"},{"output":"Russian Federation","context":"Succession of states is a theory and practice in international relations regarding successor states. A successor state is a sovereign state over a territory and populace that was previously under the sovereignty of another state. The theory has its root in 19th century diplomacy.[1] A successor state often acquires a new international legal personality, which is distinct from a continuing state, also known as a continuator, which despite change to its borders retains the same legal personality and possess all its existing rights and obligations (such as a rump state).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA state succession can be characterized as either being universal or partial. A universal state succession occurs when one state is completely extinguished and its sovereignty is replaced by that of one or more successor states. A partial state succession occurs when the state continues to exist after it has lost control of a part of its territory.[3]\\r\\nAn example of a partial state succession is the case of the split of Bangladesh from Pakistan, there was no challenge to Pakistan's claim to continue to exist and to retain its membership of the United Nations: it was a continuator and not a successor. Bangladesh eventually was recognised as a new state: it was a successor and had to apply for UN membership.\\r\\nAn example of a universal state succession is the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Neither part claimed any continuity: both the Czech Republic and Slovakia were new successor states.\\r\\nConsequent upon the acquisition of international personality, the difficult matter of succession to treaty rights and obligations arises.[4] Succession may refer to the transfer of rights, obligations, and/or property from a previously well-established prior state (the predecessor state) to the new one (the successor state). Transfer of rights, obligations, and property can include overseas assets (embassies, monetary reserves, museum artifacts), participation in treaties, membership in international organizations, and debts. Often a state chooses piecemeal whether or not it wants to be considered the successor state.\\r\\nA special case arises, however, when the predecessor state was signatory to a human rights treaty, since it would be desirable to hold the successor state accountable to the terms of that treaty, regardless of the successor state's desires. O'Connell writes, \\"Practice is tending towards a de facto succession to at least those conventions which have a humanitarian aim.\\"[5]\\r\\nIn an attempt to codify the rules of succession of states the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties was drafted in 1978. It entered into force on November 6, 1996.[6] Only 22 states are currently parties to the convention.\\r\\nA difficult question is what the consequences are for the inhabitants of a territory undergoing state succession. If the succession is partial, the inhabitants can become nationals of a state whose territory they reside outside of. If the succession is universal, they can become stateless as the state they held citizenship to ceases to exist. O'Connell writes:\\r\\nOther scholars disagrees and instead claims that the population is naturalized and becomes citizens of the new state. Charles Hyde writes:\\r\\nand Ian Brownlie:\\r\\nand Rudolf Graupner:\\r\\nIn their application to the acquisition of independence, distinctions should be drawn between different cases, though the line of demarcation is not always clear:[4]\\r\\nThere are several recent examples where succession of states, as described above, has not been entirely adhered to. This is only a list of the exceptions that have occurred since the creation of the United Nations in 1945. In previous historical periods, the exceptions would be too many to list.\\r\\nThe Taliban state in Afghanistan (the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) became the de facto government of nearly all the country in the mid-1990s, but the Afghan Northern Alliance was still recognised by many nations and retained the UN seat.\\r\\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) was established in 1949 in Mainland China, claiming \\"succession\\" from the Republic of China (ROC). However, the succession of the PRC as the state of \\"China\\" was not initially recognized by many states because of Cold War politics and because the ROC continued to exist on the island of Taiwan and other islands, such as Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. Despite this situation, the ROC in Taiwan maintained their membership as \\"China\\" in the United Nations, and a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However, the PRC was granted the seat of \\"China\\" in the United Nations and Security Council in 1971, in place of the ROC whose recognition was withdrawn and the representatives it had sent were expelled as unlawful representatives of China. This was done through the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 2758. As of 2014[update], the PRC exercises sovereignty over mainland China, while the ROC continues to be unrecognised by the United Nations but exercises sovereignty over the Taiwan Area, with both claiming they are the sole legitimate government of both the mainland and Taiwan.\\r\\nIreland, then called the Irish Free State, seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922. The new state took the view that when a new state comes into being after formerly being part of an older state, its acceptance of treaty relationships established by the older state is a matter for the new state to determine by express declaration, or by conduct in the case of each individual treaty.[4] In practice, however, the Irish regarded the commercial and administrative treaties of the United Kingdom previously applying to the territory of the Irish Free State as remaining in force.[4]\\r\\nIsrael took the view that, by virtue of its declaration of independence in 1948, a new international personality was created and that it started with a clean slate and was bound only by such of the former international obligations affecting the territory as Israel might accept.[4]\\r\\nWhen the Democratic Kampuchea led by Pol Pot was militarily displaced by the Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, the country's United Nations seat was held by Democratic Kampuchea for many years.\\r\\nThere is some debate over whether the modern Republic of Turkey is a continuing state to the Ottoman Empire or a successor.[11] The two entities fought on opposing sides in the Turkish War of Independence (1919ÿ22), and even briefly co-existed as separate administrative units (whilst at war with one another): Turkey with its capital in Ankara and the Ottoman Empire from Istanbul, but this type of scenario is also common in civil wars. The nationalist faction, led by Mustafa Kemal who defected from the Ottoman army, established the modern republic as a nation state (or new government regime) by defeating the opposing elements in the independence war. There remains debate whether the Turkish War of Independence was a war of independence, or a civil war that led to a regime change.\\r\\nWhen Pakistan became independent it claimed that it was automatically a member of the United Nations, as British India had been a founding member of the United Nations despite its colonial status. The United Nations Secretariat however expressed the following opinion:[4]\\r\\nFrom the viewpoint of International Law, the situation is one in which part of an existing State breaks off and becomes a new State. On this analysis there is no change in the international status of India; it continues as a State with all treaty rights and obligations, and consequently with all rights and obligations of membership in the United Nations. The territory which breaks offPakistanwill be a new State. It will not have the treaty rights and obligations of the old State and will not, of course, have membership in the United Nations. In International Law the situation is analogous to the separation of the Irish Free State from Britain, and Belgium from the Netherlands. In these cases the portion which separated was considered a new State, and the remaining portion continued as an existing State with all the rights and duties which it had before.\\r\\nInternational convention since the end of the Cold War has come to distinguish two distinct circumstances where such privileges are sought by such a successor state, in only the first of which may such successor states assume the name or privileged international position of their predecessor. The first set of circumstances arose at the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991. One of this federation's constituent republics, the Russian Federation has declared itself to be \\"the continuator state of the USSR\\" on the grounds that it contained 51% of the population of the USSR and 77% of its territory. In consequence, Russia agreed that it would acquire the USSR's seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.[12] This was also accepted by the rest of the former states of the USSR; in a letter dated 24 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, at the time President of the Russian Federation, informed the Secretary-General that the membership of the Soviet Union in the Security Council and all other United Nations organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[13] All Soviet embassies became Russian embassies.\\r\\nOn the other hand, the Baltic states represent a special case. An important tenet of the modern states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is that their incorporation into the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1991 constituted an illegal occupation. In 1991 when each Baltic state regained their independence they claimed continuity directly from their pre-1940 status. Many other states share this view, and as such, these states were not considered either predecessor or successor states of the Soviet Union. As a consequence, the Baltic states were able to simply re-establish diplomatic relations with many countries, re-affirm pre-1940 treaties still in force, and resume membership to many international organisations.[14]\\r\\nAfter four of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia seceded in 1991 and 1992, the rump state, renamed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, stated it was the continuation of the state of Yugoslaviaagainst the objections of the newly independent republics. Representatives from Belgrade continued to hold the original Yugoslavian UN seathowever, the United States refused to recognize it. The remaining territory of the federation was less than half of the population and territory of the former federation. In 1992 the Security Council on September 19 (Resolution 777) and the General Assembly on September 22, decided to refuse to allow the new federation to sit in the General Assembly under the name of \\"Yugoslavia\\" on the theory that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had dissolved. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later renamed Serbia and Montenegro) was admitted as a new member to the United Nations in 2000; in 2006, Montenegro declared independence and Serbia continued to hold the federation's seat.","input":"Which state is the successor of the ussr?"},{"output":"written and produced by Del Rey and Rick Nowels","context":"\\"Lust for Life\\" is a song by American singer Lana Del Rey featuring Canadian singer The Weeknd. It was released on April 19, 2017, through Polydor Records and Interscope Records, as the second single from her fifth studio album of the same name (2017).[1][2] The song was written and produced by Del Rey and Rick Nowels, with additional writing from The Weeknd and Max Martin and additional production from Dean Reid and Kieron Menzies.[3] It is her first released song to feature another artist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with Courtney Love for Dazed magazine, Del Rey revealed that \\"Lust for Life\\" was the first song she wrote for the album and got an assist from Max Martin for it. She traveled to his Sweden compound where he encouraged her to turn what had previously been a verse into the song's chorus.

That's when she felt she \\"really wanted\\" to hear Canadian singer The Weeknd sing the chorus, so he came down and \\"rewrote a little bit of it,\\" but then she stated she felt like it was missing something, so she went back for a fourth time and layered it up with harmonies.[4] \\"Lust for Life\\" was first registered at ASCAP under Del Rey's name during March 2017, with The Weeknd credited as a co-writer under his real name Abel Tesfaye.[5] Later, Del Rey teased the collaboration on March 26, 2017 via Twitter, with Tesfaye's signature logo.[6] The logo, which is also the logo of his record label XO, was also included in the Lust for Life album trailer.[7]\\r\\n\\"Lust for Life\\" was released on April 19, 2017 following the preview on MistaJam's BBC Radio 1 show.[8] The official audio was released to iTunes and other streaming services a few hours later.[2] It is the fourth collaboration between Del Rey and The Weeknd, after she featured on \\"Prisoner\\" from his second studio album, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015), and then two collaborations on his follow-up record Starboy (2016): a feature on \\"Stargirl Interlude\\" and a co-writing credit and background vocals on \\"Party Monster\\".[4][9] This is her first song to feature another artist on any of her studio albums.[10]\\r\\nIdolator characterized \\"Lust for Life\\" as a \\"witchy dream pop\\" song,[11] as well as describing it as a \\"throwback to the wall of sound production of the '60s with the lush, beautiful harmonies associated with acts like The Shangri-Las\\".[12]\\r\\nAn official audio video was released on Del Rey's Vevo channel on the same day the song was released.

The gut metagenome is the aggregate of all the genomes of gut microbiota.[1] The gut is one niche that human microbiota inhabit.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn humans, the gut microbiota has the largest numbers of bacteria and the greatest number of species compared to other areas of the body.[3]  In humans, the gut flora is established at one to two years after birth, and by that time the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier that it secretes have co-developed in a way that is tolerant to, and even supportive of, the gut flora and that also provides a barrier to pathogenic organisms.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between some gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic relationship.[2]:700 Some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetic acid and butyric acid, which are then absorbed by the host.[3][6]  Intestinal bacteria also play a role in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics.[2][6]   The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ,[6] and dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.[3][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of human gut microbiota changes over time, when the diet changes, and as overall health changes.[3][7] A systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials that have been conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and identified those that had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe microbial composition of the gut microbiota varies across the digestive tract. In the stomach and small intestine, relatively few species of bacteria are generally present.[9][10] The colon, in contrast, contains a densely-populated microbial ecosystem with up to 1012 cells per gram of intestinal content.[9] These bacteria represent between 300 and 1000 different species.[9][10] However, 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species.[11] As a consequence of their abundance in the intestine, bacteria also make up to 60% of the dry mass of feces.[12] Fungi, protists, archaea, and viruses are also present in the gut flora, but less is known about their activities.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobes, but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities.[2] It is estimated that these gut flora have around a hundred times as many genes in total as there are in the human genome.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany species in the gut have not been studied outside of their hosts because most cannot be cultured.[10][11][15] While there are a small number of core species of microbes shared by most individuals, populations of microbes can vary widely among different individuals.[16] Within an individual, microbe populations stay fairly constant over time, even though some alterations may occur with changes in lifestyle, diet and age.[9][17] The Human Microbiome Project has set out to better describe the microflora of the human gut and other body locations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria.[18] Most bacteria belong to the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium,[9][11] Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Bifidobacterium.[9][11] Other genera, such as Escherichia and Lactobacillus, are present to a lesser extent.[9] Species from the genus Bacteroides alone constitute about 30% of all bacteria in the gut, suggesting that this genus is especially important in the functioning of the host.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nFungal genera that have been detected in the gut include Candida, Saccharomyces, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhodotorula, Trametes, Pleospora, Sclerotinia, Bullera, and Galactomyces, among others.[19][20] Rhodotorula is most frequently found in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease while Candida is most frequently found in individuals with hepatitis B cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaea constitute another large class of gut flora which are important in the metabolism of the bacterial products of fermentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn enterotype is a classification of living organisms based on its bacteriological ecosystem in the human gut microbiome not dictated by age, gender, body weight, or national divisions.[21] There are indications that long-term diet influences enterotype.[22] Three human enterotypes have been proposed,[21][23] but their value has been questioned.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the high acidity of the stomach, most microorganisms cannot survive there. The main bacterial inhabitants of the stomach include: Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, and types of yeast.[2]:720 Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative spiral organism that establishes on gastric mucosa causing chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is a carcinogen for gastric cancer.[2]:904\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small intestine contains a trace amount of microorganisms due to the proximity and influence of the stomach. Gram-positive cocci and rod-shaped bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in the small intestine.[2] However, in the distal portion of the small intestine alkaline conditions support gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae.[2] The bacterial flora of the small intestine aid in a wide range of intestinal functions. The bacterial flora provide regulatory signals that enable the development and utility of the gut. Overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine can lead to intestinal failure.[26] In addition the large intestine contains the largest bacterial ecosystem in the human body.[2] About 99% of the large intestine and feces flora are made up of obligate anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium.[27] Factors that disrupt the microorganism population of the large intestine include antibiotics, stress, and parasites.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBacteria make up most of the flora in the colon[28] and 60% of the dry mass of feces.[9] This fact makes feces an ideal source to test for gut flora for any tests and experiments by extracting the nucleic acid from fecal specimens, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences are generated with bacterial primers. This form of testing is also often preferable to more invasive techniques, such as biopsies. Somewhere between 300[9] and 1000 different species live in the gut,[10] with most estimates at about 500.[29][30] However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species, with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii being the most common species in healthy adults.[11][31] Fungi and protists also make up a part of the gut flora, but less is known about their activities.[32] The virome is mostly bacteriophages.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather is a mutualistic, symbiotic relationship.[10] Though people can survive with no gut flora,[29] the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as fermenting unused energy substrates, training the immune system via end products of metabolism like propionate and acetate, preventing growth of harmful species, regulating the development of the gut, producing vitamins for the host (such as biotin and vitamin K), and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats.[2] Extensive modification and imbalances of the gut microbiota and its microbiome or gene collection are associated with obesity.[34] However, in certain conditions, some species are thought to be capable of causing disease by causing infection or increasing cancer risk for the host.[9][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been demonstrated that there are common patterns of microbiome composition evolution during life.[35] In general, the diversity of microbiota composition of fecal samples is significantly higher in adults than in children, although interpersonal differences are higher in children than in adults.[36] Much of the maturation of microbiota into an adult-like configuration happens during the three first years of life.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the microbiome composition changes, so does the composition of bacterial proteins produced in the gut. In adult microbiomes, a high prevalence of enzymes involved in fermentation, methanogenesis and the metabolism of arginine, glutamate, aspartate and lysine have been found. In contrast, in infant microbiomes the dominant enzymes are involved in cysteine metabolism and fermentation pathways.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies and statistical analyses have identified the different bacterial genera in gut microbiota and their associations with nutrient intake. Gut microflora is mainly composed of three enterotypes: Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus. There is an association between the concentration of each microbial community and diet. For example, Prevotella is related to carbohydrates and simple sugars, while Bacteroides is associated with proteins, amino acids, and saturated fats. Specialist microbes that break down mucin, survive on their host's carbohydrate excretions.[37] One enterotype will dominate depending on the diet. Altering the diet will result in a corresponding change in the numbers of species.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nMalnourished human children have less mature and less diverse gut microbiota than healthy children, and changes in the microbiome associated with nutrient scarcity can in turn be a pathophysiological cause of malnutrition.[38][39] Malnourished children also typically have more potentially pathogenic gut flora, and more yeast in their mouths and throats.[40] Altering diet may lead to changes in gut microbiota composition and diversity.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nGut microbiome composition depends on the geographic origin of populations. Variations in a trade-off of Prevotella, the representation of the urease gene, and the representation of genes encoding glutamate synthase/degradation or other enzymes involved in amino acids degradation or vitamin biosynthesis show significant differences between populations from the US, Malawi or Amerindian origin.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US population has a high representation of enzymes encoding the degradation of glutamine and enzymes involved in vitamin and lipoic acid biosynthesis; whereas Malawi and Amerindian populations have a high representation of enzymes encoding glutamate synthase and they also have an overrepresentation of ϫ-amylase in their microbiomes. As the US population has a diet richer in fats than Amerindian or Malawian populations which have a corn-rich diet, the diet is probably the main determinant of the gut bacterial composition.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther studies have indicated a large difference in the composition of microbiota between European and rural African children. The fecal bacteria of children from Florence were compared to that of children from the small rural village of Boulpon in Burkina Faso. The diet of a typical child living in this village is largely lacking in fats and animal proteins and rich in polysaccharides and plant proteins. The fecal bacteria of European children were dominated by Firmicutes and showed a marked reduction in biodiversity, while the fecal bacteria of the Boulpon children was dominated by Bacteroidetes. The increased biodiversity and different composition of gut flora in African populations may aid in the digestion of normally indigestible plant polysaccharides and also may result in a reduced incidence of non-infectious colonic diseases.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a smaller scale, it has been shown that sharing numerous common environmental exposures in a family is a strong determinant of individual microbiome composition. This effect has no genetic influence and it is consistently observed in culturally different populations.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe establishment of a gut flora is crucial to the health of an adult, as well the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract.[42] In humans, a gut flora similar to an adult's is formed within one to two years of birth.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional view of the gastrointestinal tract of a normal fetus is that it is sterile, although this view has been challenged in the past few years.[43] Multiple lines of evidence have begun to emerge that suggest there may be bacteria in the intrauterine environment. In humans, research has shown that microbial colonization may occur in the fetus[44] with one study showing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species were present in placental biopsies.[45] Several rodent studies have demonstrated the presence of bacteria in the amniotic fluid and placenta, as well as in the meconium of babies born by sterile cesarean section.[46][47] In another study, researchers administered a culture of bacteria orally to a pregnant dam, and detected the bacteria in the offspring, likely resulting from transmission between the digestive tract and amniotic fluid via the blood stream.[48] However, researchers caution that the source of these intrauterine bacteria, whether they are alive, and their role, is not yet understood.[45]\\r\\n[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring birth and rapidly thereafter, bacteria from the mother and the surrounding environment colonize the infant's gut.[4] The exact sources of bacteria is not fully understood, but may include the birth canal, other people (parents, siblings, hospital workers), breastmilk, food, and the general environment with which the infant interacts.[50] However, as of 2013, it remains unclear whether most colonizing arises from the mother or not.[4]  Infants born by caesarean section may also be exposed to their mothers' microflora, but the initial exposure is most likely to be from the surrounding environment such as the air, other infants, and the nursing staff, which serve as vectors for transfer.[44]\\r\\nDuring the first year of life, the composition of the gut flora is generally simple and changes a great deal with time and is not the same across individuals.[4] The initial bacterial population are generally facultative anaerobic organisms; investigators believe that these initial colonizers decrease the oxygen concentration in the gut, which in turn allows obligately anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes to become established and thrive.[4]  Breast-fed babies become dominated by bifidobacteria, possibly due to the contents of bifidobacterial growth factors in breast milk, and by the fact that breast milk carries prebiotic components, allowing for healthy  bacterial growth.[45][51] In contrast, the microbiota of formula-fed infants is more diverse, with high numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, and clostridia.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaesarean section, antibiotics, and formula feeding may alter the gut microbiome composition.[45] Children treated with antibiotics have less stable, and less diverse floral communities.[53]  Caesarean sections have been shown to be disruptive to mother-offspring transmission of bacteria, which impacts the overall health of the offspring by raising risks of disease such as celiacs, asthma, and type 1 diabetes.[45] This further evidences the importance of a healthy gut microbiome. Various methods of microbiome restoration are being explored, typically involving exposing the infant to maternal vaginal contents, and oral probiotics.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gut flora first started to be studied, it was thought to have three key roles: directly defending against pathogens, fortifying host defense by its role in developing and maintaining the intestinal epithelium and inducing antibody production there, and metabolizing otherwise indigestible compounds in food; subsequent work discovered its role in training the developing immune system, and yet further work focused on its role in the gut-brain axis.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gut flora community plays a direct role in defending against pathogens by fully colonizing the space, making use of all available nutrients, and by secreting compounds that kill or inhibit unwelcome organisms that would compete for nutrients with it.[55]  Disruption of the gut flora allows competing organisms like Clostridium difficile to become established that otherwise are kept in abeyance.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn humans, a gut flora similar to an adult's is formed within one to two years of birth.[4]  As the gut flora gets established, the lining of the intestines ÿ the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier that it secretes ÿ develop as well, in a way that is tolerant to, and even supportive of, commensurate microorganisms to a certain extent and also provides a barrier to pathogenic ones.[4] Specifically, goblet cells that produce the mucosa proliferate, and the mucosa layer thickens, providing an outside mucosal layer in which \\"friendly\\" microorganisms can anchor and feed, and an inner layer that even these organisms cannot penetrate.[4][5] Additionally, the development of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which forms part of the intestinal epithelium and which detects and reacts to pathogens, appears and develops during the time that the gut flora develops and established.[4]  The GALT that develops is tolerant to gut flora species, but not to other microorganisms.[4]  GALT also normally becomes tolerant to food to which the infant is exposed, as well as digestive products of food, and gut flora's metabolites (molecules formed from metabolism) produced from food.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe human immune system creates cytokines that can drive the immune system to produce inflammation in order to protect itself, and that can tamp down the immune response to maintain homeostasis and allow healing after insult or injury.[4] Different bacterial species that appear in gut flora have been shown to be able to drive the immune system to create cytokines selectively; for example Bacteroides fragilis and some Clostridia species appear to drive an anti-inflammatory response, while some segmented filamentous bacteria drive the production of inflammatory cytokines.[4][56]  Gut flora can also regulate the production of antibodies by the immune system.[4][57] One function of this regulation is to cause B cells to class switch to IgA. In most cases B cells need activation from T helper cells to induce class switching; however, in another pathway, gut flora cause NF-kB signaling by intestinal epithelial cells which results in further signaling molecules being secreted.[58] These signaling molecules interact with B cells to induce class switching to IgA.[58] IgA is an important type of antibody that is used in mucosal environments like the gut. It has been shown that IgA can help diversify the gut community and helps in getting rid of bacteria that cause inflammatory responses.[59] Ultimately, IgA maintains a healthy environment between the host and gut bacteria.[59] These cytokines and antibodies can have effects outside the gut, in the lungs and other tissues.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immune system can also be altered due to the gut bacteria's ability to produce metabolites that can effect cells in the immune system. For example short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) can be produced by some gut bacteria through fermentation.[60] SCFAs stimulate a rapid increase in the production of innate immune cells like neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils.[60] These cells are part of the innate immune system that try to limit the spread of infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout gut flora, the human body would be unable to utilize some of the undigested carbohydrates it consumes, because some types of gut flora have enzymes that human cells lack for breaking down certain polysaccharides.[6]  Rodents raised in a sterile environment and lacking in gut flora need to eat 30% more calories just to remain the same weight as their normal counterparts.[6]  Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches, fiber, oligosaccharides, and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins.[3][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBacteria turn carbohydrates they ferment into short-chain fatty acids by a form of fermentation called saccharolytic fermentation.[30] Products include acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid.[11][30] These materials can be used by host cells, providing a major source of energy and nutrients.[30]  Gases and organic acids, such as lactic acid, are also produced by fermentation.[11] Acetic acid is used by muscle, propionic acid facilitates liver production of ATP, and butyric acid provides energy to gut cells.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGut flora also synthesize vitamins like biotin and folate, and facilitate absorption of dietary minerals, including magnesium, calcium, and iron.[9][17] Methanobrevibacter smithii is unique because it is not a species of bacteria, but rather a member of domain Archeae, and is the most abundant methane-producing archaeal species in the human gastrointestinal microbiota.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from carbohydrates, gut microbiota can also metabolize other xenobiotics such as drugs, phytochemicals, and food toxicants. More than 30 drugs have been shown to be metabolized by gut microbiota.[66] The microbial metabolism of drugs can sometimes inactivate the drug.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gut-brain axis is the biochemical signaling that takes place between the gastrointestinal tract  and the central nervous system.[54]  That term has been expanded to include the role of the gut flora in the interplay; the term \\"microbiome-gut-brain axis\\" is sometimes used to describe paradigms explicitly including the gut flora.[54][68][69] Broadly defined, the gut-brain axis includes the central nervous system, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems including the hypothalamicÿpituitaryÿadrenal axis (HPA axis), sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system including the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the gut microbiota.[54][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials that have been conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and found that among those tested, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera (B. longum, B. breve, B. infantis, L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and L. casei), had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAltering the numbers of gut bacteria, for example by taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, may affect the host's health and ability to digest food.[70] Antibiotics can cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) by irritating the bowel directly, changing the levels of gut flora, or allowing pathogenic bacteria to grow.[11] Another harmful effect of antibiotics is the increase in numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria found after their use, which, when they invade the host, cause illnesses that are difficult to treat with antibiotics.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging the numbers and species of gut flora can reduce the body's ability to ferment carbohydrates and metabolize bile acids and may cause diarrhea. Carbohydrates that are not broken down may absorb too much water and cause runny stools, or lack of SCFAs produced by gut flora could cause diarrhea.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA reduction in levels of native bacterial species also disrupts their ability to inhibit the growth of harmful species such as C. difficile and Salmonella kedougou, and these species can get out of hand, though their overgrowth may be incidental and not be the true cause of diarrhea.[9][11][70] Emerging treatment protocols for C. difficile infections involve fecal microbiota transplantation of donor feces. (see Fecal transplant). Initial reports of treatment describe success rates of 90%, with few side effects. Efficacy is speculated to result from restoring bacterial balances of bacteroides and firmicutes classes of bacteria.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nGut flora composition also changes in severe illnesses, due not only to antibiotic use but also to such factors as ischemia of the gut, failure to eat, and immune compromise. Negative effects from this have led to interest in selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD), a treatment to kill only pathogenic bacteria and allow the re-establishment of healthy ones.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nAntibiotics alter the population of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota, may change the intra-community metabolic interactions, modify caloric intake by using carbohydrates, and globally affects host metabolic, hormonal and immune homeostasis.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is reasonable evidence that taking probiotics containing Lactobacillus species may help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea and that taking probiotics with Saccharomyces (e.g., Saccharomyces boulardii ) may help to prevent Clostridium difficile infection following systemic antibiotic treatment.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen's gut microbiota change as pregnancy advances, with the changes similar to those seen in metabolic syndromes such as diabetes. The change in gut flora causes no ill effects. The newborn's gut biota resemble the mother's first-trimester samples. The diversity of the flora decreases from the first to third trimester, as the numbers of certain species go up.[45][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nProbiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed.[76][77]  With regard to gut flora, prebiotics are typically non-digestible, fiber compounds that pass undigested through the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and stimulate the growth or activity of advantageous gut flora by acting as substrate for them.[30][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nSynbiotics refers to food ingredients or dietary supplements combining probiotics and prebiotics in a form of synergism.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"pharmabiotics\\" is used in various ways, to mean: pharmaceutical formulations (standardized manufacturing that can obtain regulatory approval as a drug) of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics;[80] probiotics that have been genetically engineered or otherwise optimized for best performance (shelf life, survival in the digestive tract, etc.);[81] and the natural products of gut flora metabolism (vitamins, etc.).[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some evidence that treatment with some probiotic strains of bacteria may be effective in irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation. Those organisms most likely to result in a decrease of symptoms have included:\\r\\n\\r\\nTests for whether non-antibiotic drugs may impact human gut-associated bacteria were performed by in vitro analysis on more than 1000 marketed drugs against 40 gut bacterial strains, demonstrating that 24% of the drugs inhibited the growth of at least one of the bacterial strains.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nBacteria in the digestive tract can contribute to and be affected by the disease in various ways. The presence or overabundance of some kinds of bacteria may contribute to inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.[9] Additionally, metabolites from certain members of the gut flora may influence host signalling pathways, contributing to disorders such as obesity and colon cancer.[9]  Alternatively, in the event of a breakdown of the gut epithelium, the intrusion of gut flora components into other host compartments can lead to sepsis.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHelicobacter pylori can cause stomach ulcers by crossing the epithelial lining of the stomach. Here the body produces an immune response. During this response, parietal cells are stimulated and release extra hydrochloric acid (HCl+) into the stomach. However, the response does not stimulate the mucus-secreting cells that protect and line the epithelium of the stomach. The extra acid sears holes into the epithelial lining of the stomach, resulting in stomach ulcers.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nNormally-commensal bacteria can harm the host if they extrude from the intestinal tract.[4][5] Translocation, which occurs when bacteria leave the gut through its mucosal lining, can occur in a number of different diseases.[5] If the gut is perforated, bacteria invade the interstitium, causing a potentially fatal infection.[2]:715\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two main types of inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gut; the causes of these disease are unknown and issues with the gut flora and its relationship with the host have been implicated in these conditions.[7][87][88][89]  Additionally, it appears that interactions of gut flora with the gut-brain axis have a role in IBD, with physiological stress mediated through the hypothalamicÿpituitaryÿadrenal axis driving changes to intestinal epithelium and the gut flora in turn releasing factors and metabolites that trigger signaling in the enteric nervous system and the vagus nerve.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diversity of gut flora appears to be significantly diminished in people with inflammatory bowel diseases compared to healthy people; additionally, in people with ulcerative colitis, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria appear to dominate;  in people with Crohn's, Enterococcus faecium and several Proteobacteria appear to be over-represented.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is reasonable evidence that correcting gut flora imbalances by taking probiotics with Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria can reduce visceral pain and gut inflammation in IBD.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a result of stress and chronic activation of the HPA axis; its symptoms include abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines. Overall, studies have found that the luminal and mucosal microbiota are changed in irritable bowel syndrome individuals, and these changes can relate to the type of irritation such as diarrhea or constipation. Also, there is a decrease in the diversity of the microbiome with low levels of fecal Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, high levels of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and increased ratios of Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAllergy, asthma, and diabetes mellitus are autoimmune and inflammatory disorders  of unknown cause, but have been linked to imbalances in the gut flora and its relationship with the host.[90] As of 2016 it was not clear if changes to the gut flora cause these auto-immune and inflammatory disorders or are a product of or adaptation to them.[90][91]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith asthma, two hypotheses have been posed to explain its rising prevalence in the developed world. The hygiene hypothesis posits that children in the developed world are not exposed to enough microbes and thus may contain lower prevalence of specific bacterial taxa that play protective roles.[92] The second hypothesis focuses on the Western pattern diet, which lacks whole grains and fiber and has an overabundance of simple sugars.[90] Both hypotheses converge on the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in immunomodulation. These bacterial fermentation metabolites are involved in immune signalling that prevents the triggering of asthma and lower SCFA levels are associated with the disease.[92][93] Lacking protective genera such as Lachnospira, Veillonella, Rothia and Faecalibacterium has been linked to reduced SCFA levels.[92] Further, SCFAs are the product of bacterial fermentation of fiber, which is low in the Western pattern diet.[90][93] SCFAs offer a link between gut flora and immune disorders, and as of 2016, this was an active area of research.[90] Similar hypotheses have also been posited for the rise of food and other allergies.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe connection between the gut microbiota and diabetes mellitus type 1 has also been linked to anti-inflammatory SCFAs, such as butyrate, regulating the associated low-grade inflammatory state by controlling gut permeability.[95] Additionally, butyrate has also been shown to decrease insulin resistance, suggesting gut communities low in butyrate-producing microbes may increase chances of acquiring diabetes mellitus type 2.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gut flora has also been implicated in obesity and metabolic syndrome due to the key role it plays in the digestive process; the Western pattern diet appears to drive and maintain changes in the gut flora that in turn change how much energy is derived from food and how that energy is used.[89][97]  One aspect of a healthy diet that is often lacking in the Western-pattern diet is fiber and other complex carbohydrates that a healthy gut flora require flourishing; changes to gut flora in response to a Western-pattern diet appear to increase the amount of energy generated by the gut flora which may contribute to obesity and metabolic syndrome.[74] There is also evidence that microbiota influence eating behaviours based on the preferences of the microbiota, which can lead to the host consuming more food eventually resulting in obesity. It has generally been observed that with higher gut microbiome diversity, the microbiota will spend energy and resources on competing with other microbiota and less on manipulating the host. The opposite is seen with lower gut microbiome diversity, and these microbiotas may work together to create host food cravings.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the liver plays a dominant role in blood glucose homeostasis by maintaining a balance between the uptake and storage of glucose through the metabolic pathways of glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis. Intestinal lipids regulate glucose homeostasis involving a gut-brain-liver axis. The direct administration of lipids into the upper intestine increases the long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (LCFA-CoA) levels in the upper intestines and suppresses glucose production even under subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or gut vagal deafferentation. This interrupts the neural connection between the brain and the gut and blocks the upper intestinal lipids' ability to inhibit glucose production. The gut-brain-liver axis and gut microbiota composition can regulate the glucose homeostasis in the liver and provide potential therapeutic methods to treat obesity and diabetes.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as gut flora can function in a feedback loop that can drive the development of obesity, there is evidence that restricting intake of calories (i.e., dieting) can drive changes to the composition of the gut flora.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the liver is fed directly by the portal vein, whatever crosses the intestinal epithelium and the intestinal mucosal barrier enters the liver, as do cytokines generated there.[99] Dysbiosis in the gut flora has been linked with the development of cirrhosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome genera of bacteria, such as Bacteroides and Clostridium, have been associated with an increase in tumor growth rate, while other genera, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, are known to prevent tumor formation.[9] As of December 2017 there was preliminary and indirect evidence that gut microbiota might mediate response to PD-1 inhibitors; the mechanism was unknown.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest in the relationship between gut flora and neuropsychiatric issues was sparked by a 2004 study showing that germ-free mice showed an exaggerated HPA axis response to stress compared to non-GF laboratory mice.[54]  As of January 2016, most of the work that has been done on the role of gut flora in the gut-brain axis had been conducted in animals, or characterizing the various neuroactive compounds that gut flora can produce, and studies with humans measuring differences between people with various psychiatric and neurological differences, or changes to gut flora in response to stress, or measuring effects of various probiotics (dubbed \\"psychobiotics in this context), had generally been small and could not be generalized; whether changes to gut flora are a result of disease, a cause of disease, or both in any number of possible feedback loops in the gut-brain axis, remained unclear.[54][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nA systematic review from 2016 examined the preclinical and small human trials that have been conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and found that among those tested, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera (B. longum, B. breve, B. infantis, L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, and L. casei), had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from mammals, some insects also possess complex and diverse gut microbiota that play key nutritional roles.[101] Microbial communities associated termites can constitute a majority of the weight of the individuals and perform important roles in the digestion of lignocellulose and nitrogen fixation.[102] These communities are host-specific, and closely related insect species share comparable similarities in gut microbiota composition.[103][104] In cockroaches, gut microbiota have been shown to assemble in a deterministic fashion, irrespective of the inoculum;[105] the reason for this host-specific assembly remains unclear. Bacterial communities associated with insects like termites and cockroaches are determined by a combination of forces, primarily diet, but there is some indication that host phylogeny may also be playing a role in the selection of lineages.[103][104]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than 51 years it has been known that the administration of low doses of antibacterial agents promotes the growth of farm animals to increase weight gain.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a study performed on mice by Ilseung Cho,[73] the ratio of Firmicutes and Lachnospiraceae was significantly elevated in animals treated with subtherapeutic doses of different antibiotics. By analyzing the caloric content of faeces and the concentration of small chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the GI tract, they concluded that the changes in the composition of microbiota lead to an increased capacity to extract calories from otherwise indigestible constituents, and to an increased production of SCFAs. These findings provide evidence that antibiotics perturb not only the composition of the GI microbiome but also its metabolic capabilities, specifically with respect to SCFAs.[73]","input":"What vitamin is produced by bacteria in the gut?"},{"output":"Western Australia","context":"The southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) is one of three extant species of wombats. It is found in scattered areas of semiarid scrub and mallee from the eastern Nullarbor Plain to the New South Wales border area. It is the smallest of all three wombat species. The young often do not survive dry seasons. It is the state animal of South Australia.[3]\\r\\nAmong the oldest southern hairy-nosed wombats ever documented were a male and a female from Brookfield Zoo just outside Chicago. Their names were Carver, which lived to be 34, and his mother, Vicky, which lived to be 24.[4] In South Australia in 2010, a domesticated wombat named Wally was also reported as having reached the age of 34.[5] The oldest currently living captive southern hairy nosed wombat is Hamlet at the Toronto Zoo at age 33.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southern hairy-nosed wombat is adapted to digging; it has a stocky and robust build, flattened claws, and five digits.[7] It is also plantigrade. The body length ranges from 772 to 934?mm (30.4 to 36.8?in) with a body mass ranging from 19 to 32?kg (42 to 71?lb).[7] Its short tail is hidden by its fur. The pelage is silky and is typically greyish or tan in colour. The wombat grooms itself with its second and third toes, which are fused together, except at the tips.[8][9] The head is robust and flattened and the ears are pointed.[10] The snout resembles that of a pig.[8] The animal gets its name from the hairs that cover its rhinarium.[7] The wombat's incisors resemble those of rodents, and its molars are widely spaced by the palate.[8] The teeth keep growing for the entirety of the animals life, which is likely an adaptation to its harsh diet.[7] Compared to the common wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat has a larger temporalis muscle and a smaller masseter muscle.[11] Also, unlike the northern hairy-nosed wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombats nasal bone is longer than the frontal bone.[7]\\r\\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats range though Western Australia, southern South Australia, and south-western New South Wales. They live in semiarid to arid grasslands and woodlands.[10]\\r\\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats, along with other wombat species, select native perennial grasses and sedges, but do consume introduced pasture species, forbs, and the leaves of woody shrubs if their favoured food is not available.[12] Much of the southern hairy-nosed wombat's diet is Stipa nitida, which grows around its warren complex and is trimmed as it grazes.[12] This creates an area with a higher density of new green shoots, a sign of delayed growth of individual grass.[8] The teeth of the wombat are more effective in grinding food into small particles than the western grey kangaroo.[8] Its digestive tract has a tiny caecum and a colon divided into parts.[12] The anterior part is relatively small and serves as the site for fermentation, while the posterior part is larger and is where water is reabsorbed. The wombat conserves water by recycling more urea to the colon rather than releasing it as urine. Wombats release less than other herbivorous mammals.[13] As such, the southern hairy-nosed wombat produces very dry faeces, with water contents as low as 40%.[12]\\r\\nThe harsh environment in which the southern hairy-nosed wombat lives is further reflected in its energetics. In captivity, their standard metabolic rate was found to be 130 kl/kg^0.75 per day, which is very low compared to most placental animals and other marsupials.[13][14] They also have the lowest thyroid hormone levels among mammals.[12] The food wombats eat provides more than enough energy.[13] As long as enough food is available, the forage consumed by the wombat can support it during late lactation. It is more effective than a donkey at maintaining its weight on low-quality food.[15]\\r\\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats dig and live in burrows which they connect into warrens with many entrances. These warrens are their prime refuges and are shared by up to 10 individuals.[12] A wombat digs with its fore claws while sitting up.[16] It leaves its new burrow backwards and pushes out soil with all its paws.[16] The central warren is surrounded by a circle of small, simple burrows 100ÿ15?m from it.[14] The small burrows along the outer edges is where young wombats go when they are displaced from the central warren.[12] Wombats may favour a certain burrow and not share it with others. However, there is no monopolization of burrows.[17] Wombats move between burrows and even warrens. Male wombats are territorial towards wombats from other warrens, possibly to defend food resources and the warren refuges.[12] Trails of droppings connect the burrows. The males also mark their territory with anal scent secretions by rubbing their backs and rumps on objects.[8] Fights between males over territories or mates do occur and involve bites to the ears, flanks, or rumps.[7] Also, a dominance hierarchy exists among males.[7]\\r\\nThe burrows of a southern hairy-nosed wombat can have air temperatures around of 14?C in midwinter to 26?C in midsummer, the wombat's preferred thermo-neutral zone, while the ambient temperatures outside range from down to around 2?C in Winter and up to 36?C or above during Summer.[18] Warrens can make surface conditions in habitats of low humidity and high temperatures better for the wombat.[18] A wombat retires deep in the burrow after foraging.[14] The next night, the wombat moves to the entrance to check if conditions are right before emerging again.[14] In the evening, wombats leave their burrows as the ambient temperature and burrow temperature are the same. In the early morning, when the surface temperature is lower, they retire.[19]\\r\\nThe breeding of the southern hairy-nosed wombat occurs when their favoured food is at its peak growth rates. Their reproduction relies on the winter rainfall, which germinates the grasses.[8] Between August and October, when rainfall is sufficient, females enter ovulation and the males' testosterone levels and prostate gland sizes increase. In years of low rainfall, neither occurs.[12] When breeding, dominance hierarchies among males are established through aggression.[9] Copulation takes place in the warren, with males remaining in one burrow and females moving among them. Mating takes place underground and involves the male mounting the female from behind while she is on her side.[17] The gestation period of the wombat lasts 22?days and most births occur in October. When a young is born, it climbs into the pouch and clings to a teat. It stays in the pouch for six months growing to around 0.45?kg, with a light pelage and open eyes.[12] It soon leaves the pouch and starts grazing at the surface. The young is fully weaned when it is a year old and reaches full size at the age of three years,[12] which is also when it becomes sexually mature.[7]\\r\\nSouthern hairy-nosed wombats use vocalisations and scents for communication. While most communication between wombats occurs through olfaction and scent-marking, as they do not often encounter each other directly,[7] they emit rough, coughing noises when they pass each other, and emit a more strident call for alarm.[8]\\r\\nThe southern hairy-nosed wombat was listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN in 2016, because \\"many subpopulations are now isolated and may be non-viable\\". It was previously listed as Least Concern because \\"While there are sporadic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, competition with introduced herbivores, susceptibility to drought, and severe fragmentation in parts of its range, the species has a wide distribution, large population, occurs in a number of protected areas, and it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category\\".[2] Wombats were hunted by aboriginal people for their meat. However, capturing a wombat takes considerable time and energy, so they were not hunted too frequently.[20] The indigenous people of Australia value the wombat culturally and keep their local wombat populations healthy by hunting wombats in other areas.[20]\\r\\nWombats have been considered as agricultural pests by landholders.[21] Their digging can destroy crops and can increase the risk of livestock breaking their legs by falling though their burrow systems.[22] Competition between livestock, rabbits, and wombats can lead to overgrazing. Overgrazing and the spread of invasive weeds in some areas has led to the flora being dominated by annual grass and weed species, from which wombats cannot get enough of their metabolic needs, resulting in reports of emaciation and mass starvation.[7][23] The competition from introduced rabbits threatens the survival of wombats.[7]","input":"Where does the southern hairy nosed wombat live?"},{"output":"Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666","context":"The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666.[1] The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It threatened but did not reach the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums.[2] It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.[3]\\r\\nThe death toll is unknown but traditionally thought to have been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded. This reasoning has recently been challenged on the grounds that the deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded, while the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains. A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached 1250 C.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Fire started at the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major firefighting technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered on Sunday night, the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday into the heart of the City.\\r\\nOrder in the streets broke down as rumours arose of suspicious foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread over most of the City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.\\r\\nThe social and economic problems created by the disaster were overwhelming. Evacuation from London and resettlement elsewhere were strongly encouraged by Charles II, who feared a London rebellion amongst the dispossessed refugees. Despite numerous radical proposals, London was reconstructed on essentially the same street plan used before the fire.[5]\\r\\nBy the 1660s, London was by far the largest city in Britain, estimated at half a million inhabitants. John Evelyn, comparing London to the Baroque magnificence of Paris, called it a \\"wooden, northern, and inartificial congestion of Houses\\", and expressed alarm about the fire hazards posed by the wood and the congestion.[6] By \\"inartificial\\", Evelyn meant unplanned and makeshift, the result of organic growth and unregulated urban sprawl.[7]\\r\\nLondon had been a Roman settlement for four centuries and had become progressively more crowded inside its defensive city wall. It had also pushed outwards beyond the wall into squalid extramural slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster.[7]\\r\\nBy the late 17th century, the City properthe area bounded by the City wall and the River Thameswas only a part of London, covering some 700 acres (2.8?km2; 1.1?sq?mi),[8] and home to about 80,000 people, or one sixth of London's inhabitants. The City was surrounded by a ring of inner suburbs where most Londoners lived. The City was then, as now, the commercial heart of the capital, and was the largest market and busiest port in England, dominated by the trading and manufacturing classes.[9]\\r\\nThe aristocracy shunned the City and lived either in the countryside beyond the slum suburbs, or in the exclusive Westminster district (the modern West End), the site of Charles II's court at Whitehall. Wealthy people preferred to live at a convenient distance from the traffic-clogged, polluted, unhealthy City, especially after it was hit by a devastating outbreak of bubonic plague in the Plague Year of 1665.\\r\\nThe relationship was often tense between the City and the Crown. The City of London had been a stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642ÿ1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still had the potential to be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.[10]\\r\\nThey were determined to thwart any similar tendencies in his son, and when the Great Fire threatened the City, they refused the offers that Charles made of soldiers and other resources. Even in such an emergency, the idea of having the unpopular Royal troops ordered into the City was political dynamite. By the time that Charles took over command from the ineffectual Lord Mayor, the fire was already out of control.[11]\\r\\nThe City was essentially medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, the most recent in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used.[12] The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose every inch of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, many of which were fire hazardsfoundries, smithies, glazierswhich were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.\\r\\nThe human habitations were crowded to bursting point, intermingled with these sources of heat, sparks, and pollution, and their construction increased the fire risk. The typical six- or seven-storey timbered London tenement houses had \\"jetties\\" (projecting upper floors). They had a narrow footprint at ground level, but maximised their use of land by \\"encroaching\\" on the street, as a contemporary observer put it, with the gradually increasing size of their upper storeys. The fire hazard was well perceived when the top jetties all but met across the narrow alleys; \\"as it does facilitate a conflagration, so does it also hinder the remedy\\", wrote one observer[13]but \\"the covetousness of the citizens and connivancy [corruption] of Magistrates\\" worked in favour of jetties. In 1661, Charles II issued a proclamation forbidding overhanging windows and jetties, but this was largely ignored by the local government. Charles's next, sharper message in 1665 warned of the risk of fire from the narrowness of the streets and authorised both imprisonment of recalcitrant builders and demolition of dangerous buildings. It, too, had little impact.\\r\\nThe river front was important in the development of the Great Fire. The Thames offered water for firefighting and the chance of escape by boat, but the poorer districts along the riverfront had stores and cellars of combustibles which increased the fire risk. All along the wharves, the rickety wooden tenements and tar paper shacks of the poor were shoehorned amongst \\"old paper buildings and the most combustible matter of tarr, pitch, hemp, rosen, and flax which was all layd up thereabouts.\\"[14]\\r\\nLondon was also full of black powder, especially along the river front. Much of it was left in the homes of private citizens from the days of the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them. Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London.[15] The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.\\r\\nFires were common in the crowded wood-built city with its open fireplaces, candles, ovens, and stores of combustibles. There was no police or fire brigade to call, but London's local militia, known as the Trained Bands, was available for general emergencies, at least in principle, and watching for fire was one of the jobs of the watch, a thousand watchmen or \\"bellmen\\" who patrolled the streets at night.[16] Self-reliant community procedures were in place for dealing with fires, and they were usually effective. Public-spirited citizens would be alerted to a dangerous house fire by muffled peals on the church bells, and would congregate hastily to fight the fire.\\r\\nThe methods available for this relied on demolition and water. By law, the tower of every parish church had to hold equipment for these efforts: long ladders, leather buckets, axes, and \\"firehooks\\" for pulling down buildings (see illustration right, see also pike pole).[17] Sometimes taller buildings were levelled to the ground quickly and effectively by means of controlled gunpowder explosions. This drastic method of creating firebreaks was increasingly used towards the end of the Great Fire, and modern historians believe that it was what finally won the struggle.[18]\\r\\nLondon Bridge was the only physical connection between the City and the south side of the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge.[19] There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.[20]\\r\\nThe 18-foot (5.5?m) high Roman wall enclosing the City put the fleeing homeless at risk of being shut into the inferno. Once the riverfront was on fire and the escape route cut off by boat, the only exits were the eight gates in the wall. During the first couple of days, few people had any notion of fleeing the burning City altogether. They would remove what they could carry of their belongings to the nearest \\"safe house\\", in many cases the parish church or the precincts of St Paul's Cathedral, only to have to move again hours later. Some moved their belongings and themselves \\"four and five times\\" in a single day.[21] The perception of a need to get beyond the walls only took root late on the Monday, and then there were near-panic scenes at the narrow gates as distraught refugees tried to get out with their bundles, carts, horses, and wagons.\\r\\nThe crucial factor which frustrated firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even under normal circumstances, the mix of carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.\\r\\nDemolishing the houses downwind of a dangerous fire was often an effective way of containing the destruction by means of firehooks or explosives. This time, however, demolition was fatally delayed for hours by the Lord Mayor's lack of leadership and failure to give the necessary orders.[22] By the time that orders came directly from the King to \\"spare no houses\\", the fire had devoured many more houses, and the demolition workers could no longer get through the crowded streets.\\r\\nThe use of water to extinguish the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington.[23] It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane was close to the river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.\\r\\nThis did not happen, or at least was no longer happening by the time that Pepys viewed the fire from the river at mid-morning on the Sunday. Pepys comments in his diary that nobody was trying to put it out, but instead they fled from it in fear, hurrying \\"to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire.\\" The flames crept towards the river front with little interference from the overwhelmed community and soon torched the flammable warehouses along the wharves. The resulting conflagration cut off the firefighters from the immediate water supply from the river and set alight the water wheels under London Bridge which pumped water to the Cornhill water tower; the direct access to the river and the supply of piped water failed together.\\r\\nLondon possessed advanced fire-fighting technology in the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds.[24] They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no delivery hoses.[25]\\r\\nOn this occasion, an unknown number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were designed to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.\\r\\nThe personal experiences of many Londoners during the fire are glimpsed in letters and memoirs. The two best-known diarists of the Restoration are Samuel Pepys (1633ÿ1703) and John Evelyn (1620ÿ1706), and both recorded the events and their own reactions day by day, and made great efforts to keep themselves informed of what was happening all over the City and beyond. For example, they both travelled out to the Moorfields park area north of the City on the Wednesdaythe fourth dayto view the mighty encampment of distressed refugees there, which shocked them. Their diaries are the most important sources for all modern retellings of the disaster. Books on the fire by Tinniswood (2003) and Hanson (2001) also rely on the brief memoirs of William Taswell (1651ÿ82), who was a fourteen year-old schoolboy at Westminster School in 1666.\\r\\nAfter two rainy summers in 1664 and 1665, London had lain under an exceptional drought since November 1665, and the wooden buildings were tinder-dry after the long hot summer of 1666. A fire broke out at Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane a little after midnight on Sunday 2 September. The family was trapped upstairs but managed to climb from an upstairs window to the house next door, except for a maidservant who was too frightened to try, who became the first victim.[27] The neighbours tried to help douse the fire; after an hour, the parish constables arrived and judged that the adjoining houses had better be demolished to prevent further spread. The householders protested, and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was summoned, who alone had the authority to override their wishes.\\r\\nWhen Bloodworth arrived, the flames were consuming the adjoining houses and creeping towards the paper warehouses and flammable stores on the river front. The more experienced firemen were clamouring for demolition, but Bloodworth refused on the grounds that most premises were rented and the owners could not be found. Bloodworth is generally thought to have been appointed to the office of Lord Mayor as a yes man, rather than by possessing requisite capabilities for the job. He panicked when faced with a sudden emergency[28] and, when pressed, made the oft-quoted remark, \\"Pish! A woman could piss it out\\", and left. After the City had been destroyed, Samuel Pepys looked back on the events and wrote in his diary on 7 September 1666: \\"People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity [the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor in general; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him.\\"\\r\\nPepys was a senior official in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had turned it into a conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.\\r\\nHe took a boat to inspect the destruction around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a \\"lamentable\\" fire, \\"everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another.\\" Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, \\"where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me to go to my Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way.\\" Charles' brother James, Duke of York offered the use of the Royal Life Guards to help fight the fire.[29]\\r\\nYoung schoolboy William Taswell had bolted from the early morning service in Westminster Abbey. He saw some refugees arrive in hired lighter boats near Westminster Stairs, a mile west of Pudding Lane, unclothed and covered only with blankets.[30] The services of the lightermen had suddenly become extremely expensive, and only the luckiest refugees secured a place in a boat.\\r\\nThe fire spread quickly in the high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people abandoned attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before he had to get out and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.\\r\\nPepys found Bloodworth trying to co-ordinate the fire-fighting efforts and near to collapse, \\"like a fainting woman\\", crying out plaintively in response to the King's message that he was pulling down houses. \\"But the fire overtakes us faster then [sic] we can do it.\\" Holding on to his civic dignity, he refused James's offer of soldiers and then went home to bed.[31] King Charles II sailed down from Whitehall in the Royal barge to inspect the scene. He found that houses were still not being pulled down, in spite of Bloodworth's assurances to Pepys, and daringly overrode the authority of Bloodworth to order wholesale demolitions west of the fire zone.[32] The delay rendered these measures largely futile, as the fire was already out of control.\\r\\nBy Sunday afternoon, 18?hours after the alarm was raised in Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging firestorm that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought;[33] instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both north and south of the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.\\r\\nPepys went again on the river in the early evening with his wife and some friends, \\"and to the fire up and down, it still encreasing\\". They ordered the boatman to go \\"so near the fire as we could for smoke; and all over the Thames, with one's face in the wind, you were almost burned with a shower of firedrops\\". When the \\"firedrops\\" became unbearable, the party went on to an alehouse on the South Bank and stayed there till darkness came and they could see the fire on London Bridge and across the river, \\"as only one entire arch of fire from this to the other side of the bridge, and in a bow up the hill for an arch of above a mile long: it made me weep to see it\\". Pepys described this arch of fire as \\"a bow with God's arrow in it with a shining point\\".\\r\\nThe fire was principally expanding north and west by dawn on Monday, 3 September, the turbulence of the fire storm pushing the flames both farther south and farther north than the day before.[34] The spread to the south was mostly halted by the river, but it had torched the houses on London Bridge and was threatening to cross the bridge and endanger the borough of Southwark on the south bank of the river. Southwark was preserved by a pre-existent firebreak on the bridge, a long gap between the buildings which had saved the south side of the Thames in the fire of 1632 and now did so again.[35] Flying embers started a fire in Southwark but it was quickly stopped.\\r\\nThe fire's spread to the north reached the financial heart of the City. The houses of the bankers in Lombard Street began to burn on Monday afternoon, prompting a rush to get their stacks of gold coins to safety before they melted away, so crucial to the wealth of the city and the nation. Several observers emphasise the despair and helplessness which seemed to seize Londoners on this second day, and the lack of efforts to save the wealthy, fashionable districts which were now menaced by the flames, such as the Royal Exchangecombined bourse and shopping centre ÿ and the opulent consumer goods shops in Cheapside. The Royal Exchange caught fire in the late afternoon, and was a smoking shell within a few hours. John Evelyn, courtier and diarist, wrote:\\r\\nEvelyn lived in Deptford, four miles (6?km) outside the City, and so he did not see the early stages of the disaster. He went by coach to Southwark on Monday, joining many other upper-class people, to see the view which Pepys had seen the day before of the burning City across the river. The conflagration was much larger now: \\"the whole City in dreadful flames near the water-side; all the houses from the Bridge, all Thames-street, and upwards towards Cheapside, down to the Three Cranes, were now consumed\\".[37]\\r\\nIn the evening, Evelyn reported that the river was covered with barges and boats making their escape piled with goods. He observed a great exodus of carts and pedestrians through the bottleneck City gates, making for the open fields to the north and east, \\"which for many miles were strewed with moveables of all sorts, and tents erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous spectacle!\\"[37]\\r\\nSuspicion soon arose in the threatened city that the fire was no accident. The swirling winds carried sparks and burning flakes long distances to lodge on thatched roofs and in wooden gutters, causing seemingly unrelated house fires to break out far from their source and giving rise to rumours that fresh fires were being set on purpose. Foreigners were immediately suspects because of the current Second Anglo-Dutch War. Fear and suspicion hardened into certainty on Monday, as reports circulated of imminent invasion and of foreign undercover agents seen casting \\"fireballs\\" into houses, or caught with hand grenades or matches.[38] There was a wave of street violence.[39] William Taswell saw a mob loot the shop of a French painter and level it to the ground, and watched in horror as a blacksmith walked up to a Frenchman in the street and hit him over the head with an iron bar.\\r\\nThe fears of terrorism received an extra boost from the disruption of communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.\\r\\nThere were also religious alarms of renewed Gunpowder Plots. Suspicions rose to panic and collective paranoia on Monday, and both the Trained Bands and the Coldstream Guards focused less on fire fighting and more on rounding up foreigners, Catholics, and any odd-looking people, arresting them or rescuing them from mobs, or both together.\\r\\nThe inhabitants were growing desperate to remove their belongings from the City, especially the upper class. This provided a source of income for the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable for the owners of carts and boats. Hiring a cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as S40, a fortune equivalent to more than S4,000 in 2005.[40]\\r\\nSeemingly every cart and boat owner within reach of London made their way towards the City to share in these opportunities, the carts jostling at the narrow gates with the panicked inhabitants trying to get out. The chaos at the gates was such that the magistrates ordered the gates shut on Monday afternoon, in the hope of turning the inhabitants' attention from safeguarding their own possessions to fighting the fire: \\"that, no hopes of saving any things left, they might have more desperately endeavoured the quenching of the fire.\\"[41] This headlong and unsuccessful measure was rescinded the next day.\\r\\nMonday marked the beginning of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events.[42] In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.\\r\\nJames set up command posts round the perimeter of the fire, press-ganging into teams of well-paid and well-fed firemen any men of the lower classes found in the streets. Three courtiers were put in charge of each post, with authority from Charles himself to order demolitions. This visible gesture of solidarity from the Crown was intended to cut through the citizens' misgivings about being held financially responsible for pulling down houses. James and his life guards rode up and down the streets all Monday, rescuing foreigners from the mob and attempting to keep order. \\"The Duke of York hath won the hearts of the people with his continual and indefatigable pains day and night in helping to quench the Fire,\\" wrote a witness in a letter on 8 September.[43]\\r\\nOn Monday evening, hopes were dashed that the massive stone walls of Baynard's Castle, Blackfriars would stay the course of the flames, the western counterpart of the Tower of London. This historic royal palace was completely consumed, burning all night.[44]\\r\\nA contemporary account said that King Charles in person worked manually, that day or later, to help throw water on flames and to help demolish buildings to make a firebreak.\\r\\nTuesday, 4 September was the day of greatest destruction.[45] The Duke of York's command post at Temple Bar, where Strand meets Fleet Street, was supposed to stop the fire's westward advance towards the Palace of Whitehall. He hoped that the River Fleet would form a natural firebreak, making a stand with his firemen from the Fleet Bridge and down to the Thames. However, early on Tuesday morning, the flames jumped over the Fleet and outflanked them, driven by the unabated easterly gale, forcing them to run for it. There was consternation at the palace as the fire continued implacably westward; \\"Oh, the confusion there was then at that court!\\" wrote Evelyn.\\r\\nWorking to a plan at last, James's firefighters had also created a large firebreak to the north of the conflagration. It contained the fire until late afternoon, when the flames leapt across and began to destroy the wide, affluent luxury shopping street of Cheapside.\\r\\nEverybody had thought St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural firebreak in the form of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.\\r\\nLeaving school, young William Taswell stood on Westminster Stairs a mile away and watched as the flames crept round the cathedral and the burning scaffolding ignited the timbered roof beams. Within half an hour, the lead roof was melting, and the books and papers in the crypt caught with a roar. \\"The stones of Paul's flew like grenados,\\" reported Evelyn in his diary, \\"the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very pavements glowing with fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able to tread on them.\\" The cathedral was quickly a ruin.\\r\\nDuring the day, the flames began to move eastward from the neighbourhood of Pudding Lane, straight against the prevailing east wind and towards Pepys's home on Seething Lane and the Tower of London with its gunpowder stores. The garrison at the Tower took matters into their own hands after waiting all day for requested help from James's official firemen who were busy in the west. They created firebreaks by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity, halting the advance of the fire. In a letter to William Coventry, Pepys wrote that he \\"saw how horribly the sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was [sic] enough to put us out of our wits; and, indeed, it was extremely dreadful, for it looks just as if it was at us, and the whole heaven on fire.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe wind dropped on Tuesday evening, and the firebreaks created by the garrison finally began to take effect on Wednesday 5 September.[47] Stopping the fire caused much fire and demolition damage in the lawyers' area called the Temple. Pepys walked all over the smouldering city, getting his feet hot, and climbed the steeple of Barking Church, from which he viewed the destroyed City, \\"the saddest sight of desolation that I ever saw.\\" There were many separate fires still burning themselves out, but the Great Fire was over.\\r\\nPepys visited Moorfields, a large public park immediately north of the City, and saw a great encampment of homeless refugees, \\"poor wretches carrying their good there, and every body keeping his goods together by themselves\\". He noted that the price of bread had doubled in the environs of the park. Evelyn also went out to Moorfields, which was turning into the main point of assembly for the homeless, and was horrified at the numbers of distressed people filling it, some under tents, others in makeshift shacks: \\"Many [were] without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board?... reduced to extremest misery and poverty.\\"[48] Evelyn was impressed by the pride of these distressed Londoners, \\"tho' ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking one pennie for relief.\\"\\r\\nFears were as high as ever among the traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an outbreak of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington. A light in the sky over Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions. Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were only appeased, according to Evelyn, \\"with infinite pains and great difficulty\\"[49] and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, and members of the court.\\r\\nThe mood was now so volatile that Charles feared a full-scale London rebellion against the monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted to the point of non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter. These markets were for buying and selling;[50] there was no question of distributing emergency aid.\\r\\nOnly a few deaths from the fire are officially recorded, and deaths are traditionally believed to have been few. Porter gives the figure as eight[51] and Tinniswood as \\"in single figures\\", although he adds that some deaths must have gone unrecorded and that, besides direct deaths from burning and smoke inhalation, refugees also perished in the impromptu camps.[52]\\r\\nHanson takes issue with the idea that there were only a few deaths, enumerating known deaths from hunger and exposure among survivors of the fire, \\"huddled in shacks or living among the ruins that had once been their homes\\" in the cold winter that followed, including, for instance, dramatist James Shirley and his wife. Hanson also maintains that \\"it stretches credulity to believe that the only papists or foreigners being beaten to death or lynched were the ones rescued by the Duke of York\\", that official figures say very little about the fate of the undocumented poor, and that the heat at the heart of the firestorms was far greater than an ordinary house fire, and was enough to consume bodies fully or leave only a few skeletal fragments.\\r\\nThe fire was fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, but also by the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and gunpowder stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480?C (2,300 and 2,700?F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650?C (2,000 and 3000?F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through the tens of thousands of tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.[53]\\r\\nHanson appeals to common sense and \\"the experience of every other major urban fire down the centuries\\", emphasising that the fire attacked the rotting tenements of the poor with furious speed, surely trapping at the very least \\"the old, the very young, the halt and the lame\\" and burying the dust and ashes of their bones under the rubble of cellars, producing a death toll not of four or eight, but of \\"several hundred and quite possibly several thousand.\\"[53]\\r\\nThe material destruction has been computed at 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 Company Halls, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, St Paul's Cathedral, the Bridewell Palace and other City prisons, the General Letter Office, and the three western city gatesLudgate, Newgate, and Aldersgate.[54] The monetary value of the loss, first estimated at S100,000,000 in the currency of the time, was later reduced to an uncertain S10,000,000[55] (over S1?billion in 2005 pounds).[56] Evelyn believed that he saw as many as \\"200,000 people of all ranks and stations dispersed, and lying along their heaps of what they could save\\" in the fields towards Islington and Highgate.[55]\\r\\nAn example of the urge to identify scapegoats for the fire is the acceptance of the confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster.[57] He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started.[58] These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.[59]\\r\\nAbroad in the Netherlands, the Great Fire of London was seen as a divine retribution for Holmes's Bonfire, the burning by the English of a Dutch town during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.[60]\\r\\nOn 5 October, Marc Antonio Giustinian, Venetian Ambassador in France, reported to the Doge of Venice and the Senate, that Louis XIV announced that he would not \\"have any rejoicings about it, being such a deplorable accident involving injury to so many unhappy people\\". Louis had made an offer to his aunt, the British Queen Henrietta Maria, to send food and whatever goods might be of aid in alleviating the plight of Londoners, yet he made no secret that he regarded \\"the fire of London as a stroke of good fortune for him \\" as it reduced the risk of French ships crossing the Channel and the North Sea being taken or sunk by the English fleet.[61] Louis tried to take advantage but an attempt by a Franco-Dutch fleet to combine with a larger Dutch fleet ended in failure on 17 September when they encountered a larger English fleet led by Thomas Allin off Dungeness.[62]\\r\\nIn the chaos and unrest after the fire, Charles II feared another London rebellion. He encouraged the homeless to move away from London and settle elsewhere, immediately issuing a proclamation that \\"all Cities and Towns whatsoever shall without any contradiction receive the said distressed persons and permit them the free exercise of their manual trades.\\" A special Fire Court was set up to deal with disputes between tenants and landlords and decide who should rebuild, based on ability to pay. The Court was in session from February 1667 to September 1672. Cases were heard and a verdict usually given within a day; without the Fire Court, lengthy legal wrangles would have seriously delayed the rebuilding which was so necessary if London was to recover.\\r\\nRadical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.\\r\\nWith the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches.\\r\\nOn Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200?ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which read, in part:\\r\\nThe inscription remained in place until 1830 after the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, aside from the four years of James II's rule from 1685 to 1689.[63]\\r\\nAnother monument marks the spot where the fire stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield. According to the inscription, it was evidence of God's wrath on the City of London for the sin of gluttony that the fire started at Pudding Lane and stopped at Pye Corner.\\r\\nThe Great Plague epidemic of 1665 is believed to have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people,[64] and it is sometimes suggested that the fire saved lives in the long run by burning down so much unsanitary housing with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the plague, as plague epidemics did not recur in London after the fire.[65] Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection,[66] while historian Roy Porter points out that the fire left the most insalubrious parts of London, the slum suburbs, untouched.[67]\\r\\nFollowing the Fire, the thoroughfares of Queen Street and King Street were newly laid out, cutting across more ancient thoroughfares in the City, creating a new route up from the Thames to the Guildhall; they were the only notable new streets following the fire's destruction of much of the City.[68]\\r\\nWilliam Harrison Ainsworth's novel Old St Paul's is set during the events of the fire.[70]\\r\\nThe Great Fire was released on ITV television in 2014. It was shown in four episodes. It constructs a fictional scenario involving the Pudding Lane baker's family in an alleged popish plot.[71]\\r\\nThe round \\"London's Burning\\" is said to be about the Great Fire.[69] However, the first notation of a song in this theme dates from 1580 as \\"Scotland's Burning\\".[72]\\r\\nSee Category:Former buildings and structures in the City of London.\\r\\nCoordinates: 513057N 00532W? / ?51.5157N 0.0921W? / 51.5157; -0.0921","input":"When did the great fire of london occur?"},{"output":"Colorado","context":"The Rio Grande (/?ri?o? ?r?nd/ or /?ri?o? ?r?nde?/;[5][6][7] Spanish: Ro Bravo del Norte, pronounced?[?ri.o ??ao eel ?norte] or simply Ro Bravo) is one of the principal rivers in the southwest United States and northern Mexico (the other being the Colorado River). The Rio Grande begins in south-central Colorado in the United States and flows to the Gulf of Mexico.[8] Along the way, it forms part of the MexicoÿUnited States border. According to the International Boundary and Water Commission, its total length was 1,896 miles (3,051?km) in the late 1980s, though course shifts occasionally result in length changes. Depending on how it is measured, the Rio Grande is either the fourth- or fifth-longest river system in North America.[1]\\r\\nThe river serves as part of the natural border between the U.S. state of Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le܇n, and Tamaulipas. A very short stretch of the river serves as part of the boundary between the U.S. states of Texas and New Mexico. Since the midÿ20th century, heavy water consumption of farms and cities along with many large diversion dams on the river has left only 20% of its natural discharge to flow to the Gulf. Near the river's mouth, the heavily irrigated lower Rio Grande Valley is an important agricultural region.\\r\\nThe Rio Grande's watershed covers 182,200 square miles (472,000?km2).[3] Many endorheic basins are situated within, or adjacent to, the Rio Grande's basin, and these are sometimes included in the river basin's total area, increasing its size to about 336,000 square miles (870,000?km2).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rio Grande rises in the western part of the Rio Grande National Forest in the U.S. state of Colorado. The river is formed by the joining of several streams at the base of Canby Mountain in the San Juan Mountains, just east of the Continental Divide. From there, it flows through the San Luis Valley, then south into the Middle Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico, passing through the Rio Grande Gorge near Taos, then toward Espa?ola, and picking up additional water from the San Juan-Chama Diversion Project from the Rio Chama. It then continues on a southerly route through the desert cities of Albuquerque, and Las Cruces to El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Jurez, Chihuahua. In the Albuquerque area, the river flows past a number of historic Pueblo villages, including Sandia Pueblo and Isleta Pueblo. Below El Paso, it serves as part of the border between the United States and Mexico.\\r\\nThe official river border measurement ranges from 889 miles (1,431?km) to 1,248 miles (2,008?km), depending on how the river is measured.[1] A major tributary, the Rio Conchos, enters at Ojinaga, Chihuahua, below El Paso, and supplies most of the water in the border segment. Other tributaries include the Pecos and the smaller Devils, which join the Rio Grande on the site of Amistad Dam. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable by ocean-going ships, nor do smaller passenger boats or cargo barges use it as a route. It is barely navigable at all, except by small boats in a few places; at its deepest point, the river's depth is 60 feet (18?m).[10]\\r\\nThe Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; Albuquerque is 5,312 feet (1,619?m), and El Paso 3,762 feet (1,147?m) above sea level. In New Mexico, the river flows through the Rio Grande rift from one sediment-filled basin to another, cutting canyons between the basins and supporting a fragile bosque ecosystem on its flood plain. From El Paso eastward, the river flows through desert. Although irrigated agriculture exists throughout most of its stretch, it is particularly extensive in the subtropical Lower Rio Grande Valley. The river ends in a small, sandy delta at the Gulf of Mexico. During portions of 2001 and 2002, the mouth of the Rio Grande was blocked by a sandbar. In the fall of 2003, the sandbar was cleared by high river flows around 7,063 cubic feet per second (200?m3/s).[4]\\r\\nNavigation was active during much of the 19th century,[11] with over 200 different steamboats operating between the river's mouth close to Brownsville, and Rio Grande City, Texas. Many steamboats from the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers were requisitioned by the U.S. government and moved to the Rio Grande during the Mexican War in 1846. They provided transport for the U.S. Army, under General Zachary Taylor, to invade Monterrey, Mexico, via Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas. Army engineers recommended that with small improvements, the river could easily be made navigable as far north as El Paso.[citation needed] Those recommendations were never acted upon.\\r\\nThe Brownsville & Matamoros International Bridge, a large swing bridge, dates back to 1910 and is still in use today by automobiles connecting Brownsville with Matamoros, Tamaulipas. It has not been opened since the early 1900s, though, when the last of the big steamboats disappeared. At one point, the bridge also had rail traffic. Railroad trains no longer use this bridge. A new rail bridge (West Rail International Crossing) connecting the U.S. and Mexico was built about 15 miles west of the Brownsville & Matamoros International Bridge. It was inaugurated in August 2015. It moved all rail operations out of downtown Brownsville and Matamoros.[12] The West Rail International Crossing is the first new international rail crossing between the U.S. and Mexico in 105 years.[13] The Brownsville & Matamoros International Bridge is now operated by the Brownsville and Matamoros Bridge Company, a joint venture between the Mexican government and the Union Pacific Railroad.\\r\\nAt the mouth of the Rio Grande, on the Mexican side, was the large commercial port of Bagdad. During the American Civil War, this was the only legitimate port of the Confederacy. European warships anchored offshore to maintain the port's neutrality, and managed to do so successfully throughout that conflict, despite occasional stare-downs with blockading ships from the US Navy. It was a shallow-draft river port, with several smaller vessels that hauled cargo to and from the deeper-draft cargo ships anchored off shore. These deeper-draft ships could not cross the shallow sandbar at the mouth of the river. The port's commerce was European military supplies, in exchange for bales of cotton.\\r\\nDuring the late-1830s and early-1840s, the river marked the disputed border between Mexico and the nascent Republic of Texas; Mexico marked the border at the Nueces River. The disagreement provided part of the rationale for the US invasion of Mexico in 1846, after Texas had been admitted as a new state. Since 1848, the Rio Grande has marked the boundary between Mexico and the United States from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Jurez, Chihuahua, to the Gulf of Mexico. As such, crossing the river was the escape route used by some Texan slaves to seek freedom. Mexico had liberal colonization policies and had abolished slavery in 1828.[14]\\r\\nIn 1899, after a gradual change to the river position, a channel was dug for flood control which moved the river, creating what was called Cordova Island, which became the center of the Chamizal dispute. Resolving the dispute took many years and almost resulted in the assassination of the American and Mexican presidents.\\r\\nIn 1944, the US and Mexico signed a treaty regarding the river,[15] and in 1997, the US designated the Rio Grande as one of the American Heritage Rivers. Two portions of the Rio Grande are designated National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, one in northern New Mexico and the other in Texas, at Big Bend National Park.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2001, a 328-foot (100?m)-wide sandbar formed at the mouth of the river, marking the first time in recorded history that the Rio Grande failed to empty into the Gulf of Mexico. The sandbar was subsequently dredged, but it reformed almost immediately. Spring rains the following year flushed the reformed sandbar out to sea, but it returned in the summer of 2002. As of the fall of 2003, the river once again reaches the Gulf.[4]\\r\\nThe United States and Mexico share the water of the river under a series of agreements administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), US-Mexico. The most notable of these treaties were signed in 1906 and 1944.[16][17] The IBWC traces its institutional roots to 1889, when the International Boundary Committee was established to maintain the border. The IBWC today also allocates river waters between the two nations, and provides for flood control and water sanitation.\\r\\nUse of that water belonging to the United States is regulated by the Rio Grande Compact, an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The water of the Rio Grande is over-appropriated: that is, more users for the water exist than water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse, the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged \\"The Forgotten River\\" by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition.[18]\\r\\nA number of dams are on the Rio Grande, including Rio Grande Dam, Cochiti Dam, Elephant Butte Dam, Caballo Dam, Amistad Dam, Falcon Dam, Anzalduas Dam, and Retamal Dam. In southern New Mexico and the upper portion of the Texas border segment, the river's discharge dwindles. Diversions, mainly for agricultural irrigation, have increased the natural decrease in flow such that by the time the river reaches Presidio, little or no water is left. Below Presidio, the Rio Conchos restores the flow of water.[1] Near Presidio, the river's discharge is frequently zero. Its average discharge is 178 cubic feet per second (5?m3/s), down from 945 cubic feet per second (27?m3/s) at Elephant Butte Dam. Supplemented by other tributaries, the Rio Grande's discharge increases to its maximum annual average of 3,504 cubic feet per second (99?m3/s) near Rio Grande City. Large diversions for irrigation below Rio Grande City reduce the river's average flow to 889 cubic feet per second (25?m3/s) at Brownsville and Matamoros.[4]\\r\\nThe major international border crossings along the river are at Ciudad Jurez and El Paso; Presidio, and Ojinaga; Laredo, and Nuevo Laredo; McAllen and Reynosa; and Brownsville and Matamoros. Other notable border towns are the Texas/Coahuila pairings of Del RioÿCiudad Acu?a and Eagle PassÿPiedras Negras.\\r\\nRo Grande is Spanish for \\"Big River\\" and Ro Grande del Norte means \\"Great River of the North\\". In English, Rio Grande is pronounced either /?ri?o? ?r?nd/ or /?ri?o? ?r?nde?/. Because ro means \\"river\\" in Spanish, the phrase Rio Grande River is redundant.\\r\\nIn Mexico, it is known as Ro Bravo or Ro Bravo del Norte, bravo meaning (among other things) \\"furious\\" or \\"agitated\\".\\r\\nHistorically, the Pueblo and Navajo peoples also had names for the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo:\\r\\nThe four Pueblo names likely antedated the Spanish entrada by several centuries.[19]\\r\\nRio del Norte was most commonly used for the upper Rio Grande (roughly, within the present-day borders of New Mexico) from Spanish colonial times to the end of the Mexican period in the mid-19th century. This use was first documented by the Spanish in 1582. Early American settlers in South Texas began to use the modern 'English' name Rio Grande. By the late 19th century, in the United States, the name Rio Grande had become standard in being applied to the entire river, from Colorado to the sea.[19]\\r\\nBy 1602, Ro Bravo had become the standard Spanish name for the lower river, below its confluence with the Rio Conchos.[19]\\r\\nThe largest tributary of the Rio Grande by discharge is the Rio Conchos, which contributes almost twice as much water as any other. In terms of drainage basin size, the Pecos River is the largest.","input":"What states does the rio grande river run through?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",x]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/10.md","filePath":"qapage/10.md"}'),R={name:"qapage/10.md"},F=Object.assign(R,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{H as __pageData,F as default};
