This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese .

This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

It is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three - dimensional structure from random coil . Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids . This polypeptide lacks any stable ( long - lasting ) three - dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the first figure ) . As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by the ribosome , the linear chain begins to fold into its three dimensional structure . Folding begins to occur even during translation of the polypeptide chain . Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well - defined three - dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) , known as the native state . The resulting three - dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence or primary structure ( Anfinsen 's dogma ) . The energy landscape describes the folding pathways in which the unfolded protein is able to assume its native state . Experiments beginning in the 1980s indicate the codon for an amino acid can also influence protein structure ."},{"query":"what is the length of air france seine","short_answer":"","abstract":"Flying Blue"},{"query":"who is the oldest person in the united states 2018","short_answer":"Lessie Brown","abstract":""},{"query":"who is the new headmaster after dumbledore died","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following fictional characters are staff members and denizens of Hogwarts in the Harry Potter books written by J.K.

Photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms that produced O as a waste product lived long before the first build - up of free oxygen in the atmosphere , perhaps as early as 3.5 billion years ago . The oxygen they produced would have been rapidly removed from the atmosphere by weathering of reducing minerals , most notably iron . This \`\` mass rusting '' led to the deposition of iron oxide on the ocean floor , forming banded iron formations . Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event . This mass oxygenation of the atmosphere resulted in rapid buildup of free oxygen . At current rates of primary production , today 's concentration of oxygen could be produced by photosynthetic organisms in 2,000 years . In the absence of plants , the rate of oxygen production by photosynthesis was slower in the Precambrian , and the concentrations of O attained were less than 10 % of today 's and probably fluctuated greatly ; oxygen may even have disappeared from the atmosphere again around 1.9 billion years ago . These fluctuations in oxygen concentration had little direct effect on life , with mass extinctions not observed until the appearance of complex life around the start of the Cambrian period , 541 million years ago . The presence of O provided life with new opportunities . Aerobic metabolism is more efficient than anaerobic pathways , and the presence of oxygen undoubtedly created new possibilities for life to explore . Since the start of the Cambrian period , atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15 % and 35 % of atmospheric volume . The maximum of 35 % was reached towards the end of the Carboniferous period ( about 300 million years ago ) , a peak which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at that time . Whilst human activities , such as the burning of fossil fuels , affect relative carbon dioxide concentrations , their effect on the much larger concentration of oxygen is less significant ."},{"query":"who killed monsieur the marquis in a tale of two cities","short_answer":"Gaspard","abstract":"The Marquis St. Evrémonde is a fictional character in Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities ."},{"query":"what is indian air force rank in the world","short_answer":"fourth","abstract":""},{"query":"what episode of glee does kitty join glee club","short_answer":"\`\` The New Rachel ''","abstract":"Kitty Wilde is a fictional character from the Fox musical comedy - drama series Glee .

In the case of electrons in atoms , it can be stated as follows : it is impossible for two electrons of a poly - electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers : n , the principal quantum number , l , the angular momentum quantum number , m , the magnetic quantum number , and m , the spin quantum number . For example , if two electrons reside in the same orbital , and if their n , l , and m values are the same , then their m must be different , and thus the electrons must have opposite half - integer spins of 1 / 2 and − 1 / 2 .

The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that \`\` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ?

It is produced artificially in nuclear reactors . Deliberate industrial production depends on neutron activation of bulk samples of the monoisotopic and mononuclidic cobalt isotope Co . Measurable quantities are also produced as a by - product of typical nuclear power plant operation and may be detected externally when leaks occur . In the latter case ( in the absence of added cobalt ) the incidentally produced Co is largely the result of multiple stages of neutron activation of iron isotopes in the reactor 's steel structures via the creation of Co precursor . The simplest case of the latter would result from the activation of Fe . Co decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel - 60 ( Ni ) . The activated nickel nucleus emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV , hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is Co + n → Co → Ni + e + ν + gamma rays ."},{"query":"when did virtual console come to wii u","short_answer":"","abstract":"Virtual Console is a specialized section of the Wii Shop Channel and Nintendo eShop online services that allows players to purchase and download retro games ( mostly unaltered ) for Nintendo 's Wii and Wii U home gaming consoles and the Nintendo 3DS portable gaming console ."},{"query":"who was the first european explorer in the area where texas is now located","short_answer":"Alonso Álvarez de Pineda","abstract":"The recorded History of Texas begins with the arrival of the first Spanish conquistadors in the region of North America now known as Texas in 1519 , who found the region populated by numerous Native American / Indian tribes .

Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics -- one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory and showing that they are normative for rational agents . Kant aspires to nothing less than this : to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us .

Kant thus stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time he was writing .
